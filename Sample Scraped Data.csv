Reallocating Pre-Approved And Unused Grants - Rubicon Phase 0 + Phase 1,"SummaryWe propose reallocating ~110,000 OP tokensfrom previously approved butunusedsources into the Rubicon Grants Fund. This includes60,000 OP from Phase 1, which was initially allocated for Rubicon Pools V2 (a product we no longer plan to pursue - in fact, Pools v1 was entirely deprecated well over a year ago), and over50,000 OP in unclaimed rewardsfrom Rubicon’s early user airdrop (Phase 0), which took place over 792 days ago. By sweeping these idle OP tokens into the already-approved and utilized Grants Fund, we will support further development of the Rubicon protocol, including the launch of our RUBI token, which will be airdropped to active Optimism users.Rationale for ReallocationUnclaimed Airdrop Rewards (50,000+ OP):The early user airdrop was distributed 792 days ago to over 2,700 unique users. As of now, over 50,000 OP tokens remain unclaimed. Given the significant time elapsed, it is reasonable to reallocate these unclaimed rewards to a more active use case: theRubicon Grants Program. This will ensure that these tokens are put to work, directly funding builders and projects that contribute to Rubicon and the Optimism ecosystem.Phase 1 Allocation for Rubicon Pools V2 (60,000 OP):The original Phase 1 grant allocated 60,000 OP to liquidity pools forRubicon Pools V2, a product that we have since decided not to pursue. Rather than leaving this allocation unutilized, we propose sweeping it into theGrants Fund, where it can provide direct value to builders and projects developing on Rubicon.Why Reallocate to the Grants Program?By sweeping theseidle OP tokensinto the Grants Program, we achieve the following:Maximized Token Utility:Instead of allowing over 100,000 OP tokens to collect dust, we are putting them to immediate use by funding developers, builders, and contributors.Support for the Optimism Ecosystem:TheRubicon Grants Fundis already approved and active, supporting Rubicon’s deployment on Optimism. This reallocation will enhance its ability to drive further innovation and growth on the network.Launch of RUBI Token:This OP will help accelerate the open-source development and launch of theRUBI governance token, which will include a substantial airdrop primarily aimed atOptimism users. With over$200 million in trading volume, the vast majority of which has been on Optimism, a large portion of the airdrop will reward active Optimism users. Passing this proposal will accelerate the launch of RUBI, benefiting both the Rubicon and Optimism ecosystems.Proven Track Record with OptimismRubicon has consistently executed all previous grants in good faith. In an incentives analysis conducted for the Optimism Foundation, Rubicon was highlighted as a project that has generated substantial value for the network, particularly in terms of transactions. To date, Rubicon has done over$200 million in trading volume, most of which has been on Optimism. This proposal builds on that track record by ensuring that unused resources are effectively repurposed to further benefit the Optimism ecosystem.Implementation and TimelineIf approved, Rubicon will:Reallocate60,000 OP from Phase 1and over50,000 OP in unclaimed airdrop rewardsinto theRubicon Grants Program.Continue using the Grants Fund to support developers and contributors building on Optimism.Launch theRUBI tokenASAP and upon launch execute the airdrop to active Optimism users.In the event this proposal is not approved, we will continue using the OP tokens as already approved per the rules of the Grants Council. Unfortunately, this includes a large number of tokens that are not providing any utility, hence this proposal for reallocation. Obviously, as well, this mismatch in utilization is due to us pivoting our product stack and the passage of time.ConclusionThis proposal is about optimizing the use of previously approved but idle OP tokens. By reallocating unclaimed airdrop rewards and unused Phase 1 liquidity incentives into the previously approvedRubicon Grants Program, we ensure that these tokens are put to work, supporting the development of Rubicon as an Optimism-native project and the launch of the RUBI governance token. This approach maximizes the impact of OP tokens and directly benefits both the Rubicon and Optimism ecosystems."

[Mission Request] Optimism as base for LRTs,"Optimism as the primary L2 for LRTsDelegate Mission Request Summary:Bolster presence of LRTs on Optimism as the primary L2 for hosting LRT liquidity.

Shifting even a fraction of this liquidity to Optimism from Mainnet will be significant.LRT liquidity is still nascent on most of the L2s, which means they are still in process to expand to L2s, giving Optimism an opportunity to be an early mover L2 in this space.Increased liquidity on Optimism, will help for further structured product integrations within Optimism, increasing developer concentration.Mission funding specifically for LRT projects with staking tokens, and not defi protocols that use the tokens of these projectsWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?Grantees must launch their proposed project by the half time mark of the Mission period, which in this case is 3 months.The grant to the project should be used to incentivize users to use the project and not for development/deployment to Optimism.How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Milestones: Milestones should represent tangible progress towards the deployment of the tool or application, and also also clearly define the features that will be complete and useable by the end of the grant period.Active Restaking infrastructure from the grantee project along with the rewards/incentives/points system that is also available on mainnetMilestones tied to the total liquidity that the projects bring on ChainMetrics: Did the project succesfully deploy?

[grant update] bleu Tech Partner of OP Native Projects,"Dear Optimism Community,We want to provide a brief update on our “Tech Partner of OP Native Projects” grant approved in Season 5 and seek your input on our path forward.BackgroundOur grant aims to offer 1,000 hours of technical support (UI/UX, backend, frontend, data analysis, launch support) to Optimism ecosystem projects. We’re eager to start but have encountered a challenge with project selection.In the first version of the proposal, we proposed to handle vetting projects ourselves. During the review process, the reviewers asked for a change so that the Grants Council does the selection instead (seeapproved proposal), which got incorporated into our final grant scope. Despite the grant’s approval, though, we haven’t received any project assignments from the Grants Council so far.We understand that the Grants Council is currently managing a high workload, which may have contributed to the delay in project assignments. Given this situation, we reached out to@gonna.ethto discuss potential solutions, and he proposed.Proposed ApproachAfter discussing with@gonna.eth, he proposed an alternative that doesn’t require the Grants Council’s direct involvement given their current workload:50% of our services to existing grantees50% to projects we select independently, based off the selection criteria belowWe like this suggestion because it potentially allows us to start working promptly, supporting both vetted grantees and new initiatives without additional Grants Council intervention.ConsiderationsSelecting and negotiating with projects will require time that wasn’t accounted for in the original grant. We propose deducting these hours from the total grant hours to ensure we’re being fair with our time.We recognize that this approach represents a change from the approved grant scope. We want to ensure this change aligns with the community’s expectations and Optimism’s governance standards, hence why this forum post.The 50/50 split is not based on any specific reason. We’re open to amending the split in favor of either part down the line upon community feedback and also our own perception from watching the process unfold.Selection CriteriaFor the projects we select independently, we propose focusing on open-source projects building on Optimism. Our criteria will include:Open-source nature of the projectRelevance to the Optimism ecosystemPotential impact and innovationTechnical feasibility and need for our expertiseOur proposal is to announce selected projects every month, allowing the community to provide feedback or intervene if necessary.What We Need From YouWe’re seeking community feedback on:The 50/50 split between grantees and independently selected projectsOur proposed selection criteria for independent projectsAny other concerns we should addressNext StepsReview the community feedback in this post over the next weekDo a follow-up post summarizing key points and our planned actionsShare list of potential grantees that could benefit from our services by next MondayFinally, if you’re building on Optimism and think our services could be useful, please reach out to us on Telegram at rpunktj or comment in this thread.We’re looking forward to rolling up our sleeves and getting to work!"
Token Resurrection - Analysis of Locked OP Tokens (Season 6 Mission Grantee),"This task was conducted for the Optimism Collective as part of theSeason 6 Mission Grant.TL;DRThe Token Resurrection project is driven by the need to address a common yet challenging problem in the blockchain ecosystem: recovering tokens that users mistakenly send to smart contracts without token recovery functions. Throughout this project, we have made significant progress in identifying and categorizing such locked tokens, particularly focusing on the OP Mainnet. This report covers the findings fromMilestone 1andMilestone 2of the Optimism Season 6 grant, presenting both the detailed research, analysis and technical work undertaken to bring us closer to resolving this issue for the Optimism community.AcknowledgementWe would like to extend our gratitude to the Optimism Collective and Council Members for supporting the Token Resurrection project through Season 6 Mission Grants.IntroductionTheToken Resurrectionproject was launched to address a growing issue on the OP Mainnet—users mistakenly sending OP tokens to smart contract addresses without token recovery functions, effectively locking the tokens. The purpose of this project is to help users recover their lost OP tokens and establish a process to ensure that future tokens sent in error can be recovered.The project was divided into two milestones:Milestone 1focused on researching and documenting the criteria for identifying smart contracts without recovery functions, creating a guide for manual verification, and analyzing the amount of locked OP tokens on the OP Mainnet.Milestone 2aimed to develop a user-friendly interface for users to identify their locked tokens, implement a Merkle root mechanism for secure claims, and test the process to ensure integrity and security.In this report, we summarize the methods, findings, and results from both milestones and propose a solution to recover these lost tokens by minting new tokens and assigning them to our team for distribution.MethodsData Collection and Contract AnalysisWe began by collecting transaction data from the OP token contract on OP Mainnet. Our analysis filtered transactions sent to smart contracts and excluded externally owned accounts(EOAs). This provided a dataset of 6,560 unique contracts holding over 1 OP token each.Each contract was categorized into types:Gnosis Safe Proxy, Vault Contracts, ERC-20 Tokens, and Other Contracts. After removing Gnosis Safe and Vault contracts, we narrowed them down to 1,855 contracts for further review.Contract Categorization1080×796 33.5 KBVerification Process and Checklist DevelopmentFor Milestone 1, we developed a checklist to manually verify whether the identified contracts had token recovery functions. We examined contract ABIs for functions like sweep, rescue, or withdrawal mechanisms and excluded contracts that already had built-in recovery functions. After refining our analysis, we focused on 704 contracts with no token outflow, manually verifying if they held locked tokens.Merkle Root and Claim System DevelopmentIn Milestone 2, we developed aMerkle rootmechanism based on the collected data. Using this, we created a secure process for users to identify their locked tokens and sign a proposal to claim them. The data integrity was tested, and a smart contract using the Merkle root was deployed to allow only eligible addresses to claim the tokens.Frontend Development for User InteractionA user-friendly interface was created to allow users to easily identify their locked tokens and sign claims. This interface was integrated with the backend system, enabling seamless interaction with the claim process.Home Page2559×1456 186 KBActive Proposal2559×1453 231 KBClaim Page2559×1459 178 KBToken Recovery2559×1530 254 KBResultsMilestone 1 FindingsThrough comprehensive analysis, we identified45 contractsthat hold a total of173,515 OP tokens(~ $279,358.38 - As of 3rd October 2024 at the Price of $1.61 per OP) locked due to user errors. These contracts were thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the tokens were indeed irrecoverable without external intervention.The detailed breakdown of the user addresses and locked amounts can be found in our data sheet, which tracks every verified contract holding locked OP tokens.Milestone 2 DevelopmentsWe successfully implemented theMerkle rootgeneration system and integrated it into a smart contract. The root was tested to ensure data integrity and security, providing a safe mechanism for users to recover their tokens. The interface was designed with usability in mind, allowing users to easily interact with the platform and initiate claims.The system is now ready to process claims once the required OP tokens are minted.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis confirms that173,515 OP tokens(~ $279,358.38 - As of 3rd October 2024 at the Price of $1.61 per OP) are currently locked across45 contractswith detailed analysis provided in Milestones 1 and 2.We propose that theOptimism Collective consider minting or granting an equivalent amount of OP tokensto recover the lost assets, starting with the tokens that are locked in the OP ERC20 contract.This approach is inspired by traditional financial practices where central authorities recover soiled notes and issue replacements to maintain the economy’s integrity. The Optimism Collective, with its power to mint tokens, could similarly set a precedent by enabling OP token holders to recover lost tokens, ensuring that theNet Total Supplyis maintained as:Net Total Supply = Total Minted OP - Unrecoverable OPBy taking this action, the Collective can support its users while establishing a model for token recovery that reinforces confidence in the OP ecosystem.Next StepsBefore formally submitting this proposal to the Optimism Collective, we will first gather consensus from affected token holders. Specifically, we aim to engage with 120 addresses that have lost $50 worth of OP tokens or more by transferring OP to OP ERC20. These users will be invited to sign the proposal on the Token Resurrection platform, which outlines the request for Optimism Collective to mint and distribute new OP tokens or provide these tokens as a grant by marking these as irrecoverable.The proposed distribution framework is as follows:70%of the recovered tokens will be reimbursed to the original holders.20%will be allocated as a DAO fee.10%will cover platform fees.Once the required signatures from these token holders are collected, we will formally present the proposal to the Optimism Collective for consideration.We will consult with the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the irrecoverable nature of these OP tokens too.Resources -Platform -Token ResurrectionDetailed Research Report -Detailed Report for Optimism CollectiveDetailed findings including the locked OP tokens Database -Locked OP Tokens DatabaseUser Addresses and Locked Amounts -User addresses and Locked amountsMerkle Root -Merkle RootUser guide -User guide"
Situation of Non-technical applications and Mission Requests,"The S6 for Grants council has awarded promising applications, setting up stage for great developments in the coming time. But I would like to draw the attention of the Grants Council towards the difficulty for approval for applications that are not technical in nature. Simultaneously, I would like to point out that most non-technical mission requests have been unsuccessful in awarding even a single grant.Below is the latest database on grants for Cycle 28 of the Grants council:Cycle 28 GC Public Database - Google SheetsWithin the sheet, a pattern is visible - non-technical mission requests have no approved applicant and most of the funds are unused, here are the non-technical mission requests -Analysis of Grant ProgramsCreate and Distribute Videos about Optimism Collective GovernanceIntegration of Optimism Gov and RPGF into University CoursesResearch capital migration to the SuperchainCreate Educational Programs that Empower Developers on Optimism - Modified with Lower BudgetOptimism Full Financial Auditthe only exception within the non-technical MRs isOptimism as Venture Studio,  where one application was approved.Technical rubrics with technical cutoffsMultiple questions on the Grants application form are heavily technical in nature, like code audits, developer draw and more, these questions are in practice not applicable to non-technical MRs. But the applications are still judged on a technical pov, making it difficult to score.An example mentioned in the spreadsheet mentioned above, row 4,Optimizing Grant Programs in Web3: A Framework in support of Sustainable Innovation, viewers can notice the caveat in the rubrics results section, in the Code audit part. Half of the rubric scorers have given the application a 0 score out of 4. A couple of scorers have given the application a neutral or average score, but a neutral score is also a predetermined scoring and therefore a ceiling that applicants can get, compared to the technical requirements that give full scoring.image836×840 47 KBimage814×718 41 KBFor its Developer Draw rubric , it again scored 1.33 out of 4, a low score for a rubric that neither the applicant or the mission request is trying to achieve. If the scoring from just the above two rubrics were removed from cutoff, the project most likely would be eligible to get grants. The project received scores of 35 with 40 Cutoff.Overall rubric scoring are quite rigid, and understandably so to filter out substandard applications. But applications that have cleared preliminary roundup, especially non-technical mission requests should be judged on the requirements of the mission requests and not on a rigid Final cutoff score of 40.Again for example,the rubrics of user/ developer retention, developer draw, audit are not really well placed for the MR of Analysis of Grant programsthe Rubric of demo, developer draw, user/ developer retention are not accurately judging the MR forResearch capital migration to the SuperchainorOptimism Full Financial AuditOverall the rigid measurement methods for applications on two separate ends of the spectrum will end up making a particular end disadvantaged. While OP collective interests are definitely safeguarded with such rigid methodologies to weed out disinterested applicants, it also makes it easy for technical projects to clear the hurdles compared to non-technical ones. Eventually resulting in failure to fulfil the intention of the Mission requests and omission of the potential impacts these could have.Since the non-technical projects have one final chance of application with Cycle 30 fast approaching, I would like the Grants council to reconsider its position on final cutoff score for non-technical applicants, and also leaving out technical rubrics from the non-technical applications, if that is possible within charmverse.@Gonna.ethwould love your advice if Grants Council noticed this or has something planned to mitigate this (or If I missed something on my end) . As most non-technical mission requests have 0 approvals in final cutoffs, and we are closing the final cycle of S6, would be very helpful for non-technical applications to be able to gain level ground in the review process."
[MISSION REQUEST] Startup Support - Optimism as Venture Studio,"Delegate Mission Request SummaryThis mission aims to provide new business support for projects within the Optimism ecosystem, including projects with approved grants in previous governance seasons. This program will focus on delivering support for major back-office and dev concerns faced by new startups, things such as legal counseling, dev agency work, business formation, tax prep, and so on.S6Intent 22: Intent 3Proposing Delegate/Citizen:JackanorakTotal grant amount100k OPShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:MultipleHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?Imagine the kind of support a startup incubator provides to startups; startups need this support, and the incubator has the size and resources to offer it. We can offer this kind of model.Take a highly promising project led by a handful of independent builders. They have some funds but not much—and, more importantly, they lack time and other resources to build out their project beyond what they are individually capable of managing.There’s a lot they have to take care of or fund: audits, RPC costs, deployment costs, yes, but also business formation; legal preparation; payroll; fundraising. If they are deploying a token, there’s liquidity, treasury management, regulatory concerns, etc. The list goes on, but what unites these areas is that they are essential to new projects and often prohibitively resource-consuming. Audits, for example, are essential and expensive enough that many projects turn to fundraising specifically to afford them.There are also business concerns that could, under the right circumstances, be addressed as part of this Mission: new venture strategy; business development; hiring; marketing, etc. Our bar is especially high for service providers in this sphere; there are many who claim to offer these services, but few can at the level we’d hope to be able to offer, which is at the top of our industry. It is of course also very difficult for a DAO to oversee this kind of service.All of this is to say that proposals should consider, in concrete terms: who is the builder we’re targeting with our offer? How would our in-kind support help this kind of builder? What about this service we are offering is important or helpful enough for this builder to come deploy on Optimism or consider Optimism the best place to build? Do we have evidence that many new projects need help with this service? And, finally: are we the demonstrably the best at what we do?What is required to execute this Mission Request?Applicants should provide a commitment to providing some high-quality service in exchange for granted OP. These will include but are not limited to:– Free RPC coverage– Back office help, e.g., taxes, business formation, legal assistance, banking– Short-term agency development workPlans should provide a well-defined mechanism for compensation: for 50k OP, we will provide X, Y, Z.Distribution of these subsidized services to selected project granteesApplicants must be understood to be at the top of their respective fields. It is essential that we offer through them the kind of professional support that is time efficient and longitudinally beneficial for us as an ecosystem.How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Milestones:Number of projects supportedNumber of external parties (e.g., lawyers) engagedMetricsNumber of projects successfully deployed and resulting transactions + users from themMarket value of services providedNPS from projectsImpactDepends on what service is provided, but in general this should relate to some sort of expected market-based service that has been defrayed, enabling the useNumber of projects not requiring investor fundingHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?NoWhich metric will the success of this Mission Request be evaluated against?The North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is thetotal amount of gas fees generated from the grantee’s contracts, because this Mission Request sets out to increase the aggregate demand for blockspace on the Superchain through a larger program. The total gas fees generated from this program act as a healthy indicator of its combined downstream performance. This metric was suggested by the Foundation and approved by the Grants Council."
[Mission Request] Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets (3 of 4),"Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets (3 of 4)Delegate Mission Request Summary:This mission is part of a package that is intended to make Optimism the dominant venue for trading and creating yield-bearing assets. The target assets include real-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in structure, and staked ETH.This mission is specifically designed to incentivize the importation of $70,000,000 of yield-bearing assets to Optimism. Assets that are bridged into Optimism and then subsequently deposited into DeFi protocols will target a 5% annualized reward incentive (in OP) on top of whatever native yield is produced by the DeFi protocol and underlying asset. This program is intended to only cover assets that are permissionless in their transfers between addresses.Requirements to be whitelisted should be minimal, and whitelisting is mainly to avoid subsidizing scams and to assist in tracking assets.Users may not earn rewards simultaneously through this Mission andSuperfest, which is funded through the Foundation. If an eligible asset is bridged to Optimism and then deposited into an eligible DeFi protocol, this Mission cannot provide that user with rewards until the Foundation-funded incentives are depleted or ended. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that there is overlap between this Mission and a Foundation-funded initiative, Foundation funds should be used to reward users first, and then this Mission can reward users.S5 IntentIntent 3: Grow application devs on the SuperchainProposing DelegateGFX LabsProposal TierScales up to tier of proposerBaseline Grant Amount1m OP total. This is to be distributed to users that bridge whitelisted assets and deposit them into whitelisted DeFi protocols. In the event the rewards budget is exhausted before the ended of the period, the rewards will be provided on a first-in-first-out basis. The Grants Council, at its discretion, may choose to limit the amount of OP rewards that can accrue to a single whitelisted asset to avoid crowding out of other assets.Should this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicantsMultipleSubmit by[Date to be set by Grants Council]Selection by[Date to be set by Grants Council]Start Date[If applicable]Completion DateSix months from Mission approval.SpecificationHow will this Delegate Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?This incentive program is intended to encourage users to migrate yield-bearing capital assets onto Optimism. The presence of such assets organically increases the TVL secured by Optimism over time as yield accrues to those assets, and they tend to be economically productive assets that encourage longtermism. As part of a broader, four-part package to attract RWA, staked ETH, and other yield-bearing assets, we expect this program toWhat is required to execute this Delegate Mission Request?A whitelist of eligible yield-bearing assets with permissionless token transfers. This includes at inception: wstETH, rETH, cbETH, sfrxETH, USDM, USDY, and bI0B1. wstETH and rETH are already important assets on Optimism, cbETH and sfrxETH are assets closely associated with major Superchain members, and USDM, USDY, and bI0B1 are permissionless tokens that were recently vetted and approved for Arbitrum’s treasury diversification.A process for asset issuers to apply for whitelisting by the Grants Council or its appointed agents. This process should ensure assets have permissionless token transfers on Optimism and their issuing chain, and are not scams, but should otherwise be fairly permissive.A whitelist of eligible protocols for users to deposit bridged assets into to be eligible for rewards (contingent upon teams actively assisting in data collection, to include at inception: Aave, Beefy, Exactly, Interest Protocol, Compound)A process for protocols to apply for whitelisting by the Grants Council or its appointed agents. This process should ensure the protocols meet the following criteria:Support at least one whitelisted asset as collateral or for lending by users,Provide data collection support to the Grants Council and its agents,Are present and fully operational on Optimism no later than May 1, 2024.How should the Token House measure progress towards this Mission?Number of yield-bearing assets whitelisted for this program.Amount of yield-bearing assets bridged onto Optimism from Ethereum and other chains.Duration of stay by those bridged assets.MilestonesOptimism users have bridged in and deposited $70,000,000 of reward-eligible, yield-bearing assets in DeFi protocols.How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Aggregate capital inflows from the real-world economy, Ethereum, and other chains for yield-bearing tokens on Optimism.Number of RWAs and yield-bearing projects deployed on Optimism that also have permissionless token transfers.Trading activity of permissionless yield-bearing project tokens on Optimism DEXs like Velodrome, Uniswap, and Curve.Amount of yield-bearing assets held in Optimism DAO treasuries, to help foster economic resiliency of those organizations.Have you engaged a Grant-as-a-service provider for this Mission Request?No.Has anyone other than the Proposing Delegate contributed to this Mission Request?No.This Mission Request is considered failed or withdrawn if the other three missions labeled “Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets” do not pass.Which metric will the success of this Mission Request be evaluated against?The North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated isTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of additional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by the Grants Council."

Collective Grant Policies,"Collective Grant PoliciesThese grant policies apply to all Governance Fund grants and all OP Chain grant programs stemming from Governance Fund grants. Failure to abide with the below policies may result in the refusal to deliver subsequent milestone based deliveries of a grant and/or the clawback of a locked grant.In the event that an applicant misuses their grant in a way that does not constitute a violation of these policies, a report should be filed via theGrant Misuse Reports categoryand their grant will be uploaded to a public database.Note that these grant policies do not apply to Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) grants.These policies will not cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. We ask that Optimists please act in accordance with the spirit of the Grant Policies and refrain from exploiting loopholes that may exist.Disclosures(Violation 1a)Grants-as-a-service arrangements, while not prohibited, must be disclosed prominently in any proposals utilizing such services. These services include arrangements to help teams write, review, or otherwise submit proposals in exchange for a portion of any grant received.No Sale Policy for OP User Incentives(Violation 1b)OP received through OP User Incentives Grants, or any grants made to deliver OP directly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient.This “no sale” rule:Includes the grant recipient, their affiliates and any other related persons.These persons cannot receive OP for the purpose of selling (or if the grant recipient knows they intend to sell) the tokens.Includes the direct exchange of OP for crypto or fiat, whether done publicly or privately.Think selling OP in exchange for fiat or crypto, regardless of whether done on a CEX, DEX, OTC desk, at your local park, or otherwise.Includes any other transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below.Does not include using OP to incentivize usage. Providing OP as liquidity mining incentives is not restricted by these parameters.There is no expiration to this rule for OP User Incentive Grants.Grant recipients must be able to accept OP and/or use OP to execute their proposal.Lock-Up(Violation 1c)OP received through all other grants, including Missions that do not pass OP directly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient for a period of one year.The prohibition against selling includes any transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below. After a holding period of one year, Locked Grant recipients have full discretion over how they utilize OP, so long as it coincides with the objectives outlined in their proposal.Effective Sale(Violation 1d)An effective sale includes selling, offering to sell, contracting or agreeing to sell, hypothecate, pledge, use as collateral, or creating derivatives of the OP tokens. It also includes entering into any arrangement that transfers to another person or entity, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of owning the OP tokens.You can read more about the reasoning behind the token lockshere.Self-Delegation of Grants(Violation 1e)Grant recipients must not self-delegate user incentive grants for use in governance. Locked grants may be self-delegated during and/or after the one-year lock-up period. Delegations may be made or changed at the time a grant is received or at the start of a Season.Changes to Proposals(Violation 1f)Grant recipients must execute the grant in accordance with what is outlined in the approved grant proposal. Grant recipients that wish to change the use of the grant from what is outlined in the proposal must submit a new proposal requesting approval for the change. To do so, they must follow the grants process in place at the time. If the change is not approved, the recipient must execute the grant as outlined in the original proposal or return the portion of grant affected by the unapproved change.Grant recipients must give out user incentive grants within six months of the grant being made unless they give public notice to the community explaining any delay or request an extension approved by the Grants Council.Critical Milestones and ClawbackCritical milestones demonstrate good faith effort to accomplish the aims set forth in a proposal.Critical milestones are meant to provide the Optimism community with satisfaction that the proposer has taken actions consistent with those outlined in an approved proposal.Non-completion of critical milestones will be grounds for clawback of any remaining locked tokens.On-chain data or other publicly verifiable information is favored for the determination of critical milestones.An example of a critical milestone is: “We will deploy X smart contract on Y date.”Grants to Other OP ChainsThe Collective Grant Policies apply to all OP Chain grants programs. OP Chains who receive grants must: (1) abide by these Collective Grant Policies in their grant program (i.e., make grants that follow the requirements set forth in these policies); and (2) not use their grant to run programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g. making grants to migrate protocols from OP Mainnet to another OP Chain). OP Chains will be expected to provide a list of grants made, as specified by the Foundation, to the Grants Council upon completion of their grant. OP Chains that do not do so, will not be eligble for future Governance Fund grants.EnforcementViolation of these policies can result in grant clawback or refusal to deliver a milestone based portion of the grant. To report a violation of the grant policies, use thisreporting form. Violations will be processed by the Grants Council, subject to optimistic approval by the Token House. Given the importance of these policies, the Optimism Foundation can also enforce them and claw back any grants found to be in violation.For misuse that does not constitute a violation of these policies, please follow theGrant Misuse Reporting Process.Change ProcessThe Grant Policies must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following extraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a change log will be published for delegates."
[Mission Request] Decentralized Solvers and Aggregators on OP Mainnet / Superchain,"Delegate Mission Request Summary:This mission seeks to incentivize the development and integration of decentralized solvers, aggregators, and limit order functionality on Optimism Mainnet and the Superchain. The focus is on recruiting projects similar to: CowSwap, 1inch Fusion, Pyth Express Relay, and others with similar technology to support OP Mainnet & provide a plan for future Superchain support. There is a strong emphasis on supporting the wider Superchain, with plans ready to support interoperability.S6 Intent:Intent 3: Grow application devs on the SuperchainProposing Delegate/Citizen:MattTotal grant amount:250k OPShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:MultipleHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?By bringing decentralized solvers and aggregators to Optimism, we can improve the trading efficiency and user experience, foster innovation in decentralized exchange mechanisms, and increase overall liquidity/trading volume on the network.Additionally - This will help to serve as a template for bringing these same solvers to the rest of the Superchain, with a focus on borrow/aggregation across the Superchain and implementing the Superchain ERC-20 standard.What is required to execute this Mission Request?Integration and Frontend SupportIntegrate decentralized solver and/or aggregator with Optimism Mainnet (minimum requirement)Provide frontend support for users and/or protocolsSuperchain SupportDemonstrate a plan for supporting the wider Superchain (e.g., Base, Mode, other Superchain chains)Note: Supporting additional Superchain chains is critical, but OP Mainnet support is mandatory per OP rules for grant funding.FunctionalityImplement limit order functionality where applicable (for user-facing DEXs)Integrate with a mix of DEXs on OP Mainnet (e.g., Velodrome) or other Superchain chains (e.g., Aerodrome on Base)Incorporate outside liquidity for aggregationFunding AllocationProviders can request up to 70k OPFunds can be allocated as needed to support development and launchIntegration and SpecificationProvide a list of protocols intending to integrate (for protocol integration level)and/or frontend-facing DEX aggregator detailsSubmit a full specification of the solver/aggregator network, including:Operational mechanicsUser fee structureTypical spreadDistribution of surplus/fees (specify if to solvers, market makers, or users)DocumentationOutline plans for frontend/protocol support across the SuperchainHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?

Building an On-Chain Review System with EAS,"Hey everyone,I wanted to post a quick update on our progress regarding ourSeason 5 Builder’s GrantObjective of the Builder GrantOur Builder grant was aimed at creating an onchain review web app with EAS / anAttestation-Based Dapp Rating Systemessentially anonchain Yelp for dApps.The goal of this Attestation-Based Dapp Rating web app is to allow anyone to review dApps and tools, with all reviews stored onchain (on OP mainnet, though other networks can be configured).By leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service, users can share their experiences 100% onchain, offering:TransparencyOnchain reviews are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone.Traditional databases can be opaque and prone to manipulation. Plus if Yelp or TrustPilot go bankrupt, their reviews disappear.ComposabilityAnyone can easily enable their users to leave reviews onchain:Instead of relying on web2 services like G2, Capterra, or ProductHunt, dApps can encourage their users to leave reviews 100% onchain.Official ecosystem pages from networks likeBaseandOptimismcan integrate this attestation-based rating system.Unofficial ecosystem pages such asSuperchain.eco,dappRadar, andDefiLlamacan also benefit from this setup.Similar to Farcaster, which is a protocol on which multiple clients like Warpcast and Supercast build, this system allows multiple frontends to build on the same foundation. This means that all reviews added onchain can be reused by anyone.Progress UpdateWe began developing this project even before the grant was approved and released our initial working MVP at the end of April. Since then, we have continuously added new functionalities. You can view the source code onGithuband check out the demo apphere.Here are the milestones we set and our progress on each:Milestone 1: Implement Wallet Connection and Sign-In FunctionalityWe usedwagmiandweb3modalto implement seamless wallet connection and sign-in functionality. This ensures users connect their wallets and are on the correct network to leave a review. We also addressed various edge cases, such as prompting users to switch networks automatically, preventing transactions on unsupported networks, and handling errors in case a transaction fails.You can test the entire login and sign-in flow by adding a 100% onchain review, for instance, forSynthetix.Wallet Connection1447×892 92.1 KBMilestone 2: User Interface DevelopmentWe designed a user-friendly interface specifically for dApp reviews. Users can view all reviews per project, sort by date, and filter by rating (from 1 to 5 stars). Additionally, hovering over a reviewer’s profile displays various information about the reviewer.View reviews1438×647 64.7 KBMilestone 3: On-Chain Publishing and Reputation SystemUsers can easily leave reviews onchain through various frontends, including ourdemo web app,Ethereum Ecosystem, the Ethereum Attestation Servicewebsite, or any other third-party frontend that supports the review schema. Reviews can also be added programmatically by directly calling the EAS smart contract.Review Submission Flow Through Our FrontendWallet Connection: Users connect their wallet (or create one with Coinbase smart wallet) and switch to the correct chain.ENS Check: We check if the user has an ENS set. If they do, we sponsor the gas fees, and the user only needs to sign the review using their wallet. If they don’t, they cover the gas fees themselves (usually about $0.02).Review Confirmation: Once the review is confirmed, it’s pulled into our PostgreSQL database, where we collect various data points about the reviewer to establish a credibility/reputation score. Criteria include Coinbase verification, POAP collection, Farcaster profile and followers, crypto assets, Gitcoin passport score, ENS name, etc.Reputation Score: Based on these data points, we assign a score. If it’s above a certain threshold, we display that the reviewer is highly trusted on our frontend.Reviewing Kyberswap914×860 44.8 KBOnchain Attestation918×833 57.2 KBSince we cannot prevent anyone (nor would we want to) from adding reviews onchain due to the permissionless nature of the blockchain, we have implemented checks to guide users on the trustworthiness of certain reviews. By pulling the data from the blockchain into our database, we can warn users on our frontend about the credibility of reviews based on a series of data points.Milestone 4: Algorithm EnhancementUsers can sort projects by number of reviews, overall review score, and alphabetical order. Although the current number of reviews is low, we expect this to become more effective as more reviews are posted.Sorting reviews1401×748 65.2 KBMilestone 5: Farcaster Frame IntegrationWe usedframejsto enable straightforward reviewing within Farcaster. Users can post a link to either a dApp onEthereum Ecosystemor ourdemo app, which turns the link into a Farcaster frame, allowing users to leave a review without leaving e.g. Warpcast.Frame1258×859 74.3 KBMilestone 6: Marketing Strategy ExecutionThis is a work in progress. We’ve focused primarily on development over the last 3.5 months and will now shift our focus to attracting reviews and boosting user participation.Live DemoTo see the onchain review system in action on a real-production app, check outEthereum Ecosystem, where users can review various dApps and tools. Alternatively, we have built a simpler project that focuses on listing all apps that have been reviewed:Onchain Reviews.This project is fully open-sourced and accessible onGithub.Thank you for your support and we look forward to sharing more updates as we continue to develop and enhance this project!Cheers,Maxime"

[Mission Request] Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets (2 of 4),"Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets (2 of 4)Delegate Mission Request Summary:This mission is part of a package that is intended to make Optimism the dominant venue for trading and creating yield-bearing assets. The target assets include real-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in structure, and staked ETH.This mission is specifically designed to encourage Optimism protocols to diversify their treasuries into yield-bearing assets including, but not limited to, RWAs and staked ETH. This helps build an organic user base for yield-bearing assets on Optimism, and encourages DAOs and companies primarily on Optimism to hold assets that can be relied upon in a down market where their own native tokens are not able to finance growth and expansion.S5 IntentIntent 3: Grow application devs on the SuperchainProposing DelegateGFX LabsProposal TierScales up to tier of proposerBaseline Grant Amount500k OP total. Up to 50,000 OP per Optimism-native organization, at an annualized rate of 5% (dollar-denominated) based on the market price of OP on the day of this Mission passage. The Grants Council is authorized, at its discretion, to lower this 50,000 OP cap if market conditions or budget constraints require it.Should this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicantsMultipleSubmit by[Date to be set by Grants Council]Selection by[Date to be set by Grants Council]Start Date[If applicable]Completion DateWithin 6 months of Mission passage.SpecificationHow will this Delegate Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?This incentive program is intended to encourage organizational users (e.g. DAOs) on Optimism as of May 1, 2024 to diversify their onchain asset holdings on Optimism. This helps yield-bearing assets (with permissionless token transfers) develop a user base on Optimism, and encourages DAOs and other onchain organizations to be financially secure to support their own future expenditures. This will provide a user base to attract yield-bearing, permissionless assets to Optimism so a trading and investing ecosystem can develop.What is required to execute this Delegate Mission Request?A whitelist of eligible yield-bearing assets with permissionless token transfer to incentivize. This includes at inception: wstETH, rETH, cbETH, sfrxETH, USDM, USDY, and bI0B1. wstETH and rETH are already important assets on Optimism, cbETH and sfrxETH are assets closely associated with major Superchain members, and USDM, USDY, and bI0B1 are permissionless tokens that were recently vetted and approved for Arbitrum’s treasury diversification.A process for organizations present on Optimism as of May 1, 2024 to apply for the subsidy, which includes easy verification by the Grants Council (or its designated agent) of the amount of the subsidy.How should the Token House measure progress towards this Mission?Number of DAOs and other Optimism-native organizations taking advantage of this program.Number of yield-bearing assets whitelisted for this program.Amount of yield-bearing assets held by Optimism-native organizations at the close of this program vs at its inception.MilestonesOnchain organizations (e.g. DAO treasuries) hold $10,000,000 in yield-bearing assets. Assets held by their own issuer are not counted towards this metric.How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Aggregate capital inflows from the real-world economy, Ethereum, and other chains for yield-bearing tokens on Optimism.Number of RWAs and yield-bearing projects deployed on Optimism that also have permissionless token transfers.Trading activity of permissionless yield-bearing project tokens on Optimism DEXs like Velodrome, Uniswap, and Curve.Amount of rated yield-bearing assets held in Optimism DAO treasuries, to help foster economic resiliency of those organizations.Have you engaged a Grant-as-a-service provider for this Mission Request?No.Has anyone other than the Proposing Delegate contributed to this Mission Request?No.This Mission Request is considered failed or withdrawn if the other three missions labeled “Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets” do not pass.Which metric will the success of this Mission Request be evaluated against?The North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated isTVL, because the initiatives outlined above aim to attract an influx of additional assets. This metric was suggested by the foundation and approved by the Grants Council."

[Looking for sponsor] Develop Onchain Social Games that Attract Builders to Optimism (v4),"Delegate Mission Request Summary:Develop engaging onchain social games that attract and nurture builders, fostering a vibrant community of developers who build valuable applications on Optimism.S6Intent:Intent 3A: Grow Application Developers on the SuperchainNote: Please see the comment below for context and details about the rationale and importance of this Mission Request. This Mission Request is the same as the prior versions, except it has a lower budget that fits within the remaining budget for Optimism Season 6.Proposer:Dan SingjoyTotal grant amount:15k OPShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:One or MultipleHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?The Mission Request to develop onchain games will help accomplish the Intent to grow application developers on the Superchain in several key ways:Engagement and Attraction: Onchain games are interactive and engaging, providing a fun and compelling way to attract new developers. By offering gamified experiences, builders are more likely to explore and become interested in the Optimism ecosystem.Skill Development: These games can be designed to incorporate educational elements that teach developers about the Optimism platform, its capabilities, and best practices for building on it. This hands-on learning approach helps developers gain the necessary skills and knowledge.Community Building: Onchain games foster a sense of community by encouraging collaboration and competition among developers. This helps build a supportive network of builders who can share ideas, solve problems together, and contribute to the ecosystem’s growth.Showcasing Potential: Successful onchain games can serve as showcases for what can be achieved on the Optimism platform, inspiring developers to build their own projects. Seeing the creative and technical possibilities can motivate more developers to join and innovate within the ecosystem.Incentives and Rewards: Incorporating incentives and rewards within the games can further motivate developers. These incentives can be in the form of tokens, recognition, or other benefits that encourage ongoing participation and contribution to the Optimism ecosystem.By leveraging these aspects, the mission request to develop onchain games aligns with the goal of growing the number of application developers on the Superchain, ultimately contributing to a more robust and innovative development community.What is required to execute this Mission Request?Execution Requirements for the Mission Request:Game Design and Development: Develop engaging onchain games that incorporate educational elements about Optimism.Integration with Optimism Ecosystem: Ensure seamless integration of the games on Optimism, utilizing the unique features and capabilities of the OP Stack.Incentives and Rewards: Design and implement incentive structures to motivate participation and ongoing engagement from developers.Community Engagement and Outreach: Actively invite builders to participate in the games, leveraging marketing and outreach strategies to gain sufficient distribution and network effect.Documentation and Tutorials: Provide clear documentation and tutorials to help developers understand and participate in the games.Impact Assessment: Regularly assess the impact of the games on developer engagement and the overall growth of the Optimism ecosystem, making adjustments as needed to maximize positive outcomes.These responsibilities and deliverables are essential for successfully attracting and growing application developers on the Superchain through onchain games.How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Milestones:Milestone 1: Initial Game Launch (Month 3)Deploy 1 onchain game, initiate community outreach, and invite builders to participate.Milestone 2: Midterm Review (Month 6)Conduct a review of progress, including engagement levels, community feedback, and initial impact on developer growth.Milestone 3: Yearly Review (Month 12)Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the mission’s impact on developer growth and community engagement.Metrics:Developer Engagement: Number of new developers, participation frequency, and retention rates with the game’s contracts.Onchain Transactions: Total and volume of transactions and unique wallet interactions with the game’s contracts.Community Participation: Increase in community size, showing lasting success in development.Project Development: Number and diversity of new projects, and their onchain activity, demonstrating tangible outcomes like successful RetroPGF and mission applications.Network Outreach: Reach, social media engagement, website traffic, and new sign-ups, measuring visibility and audience growth.Incentive Distribution: Amount and distribution of rewards, and their impact on participation, assessing incentive effectiveness.Impact:Developer Onboarding and Retention: Number of new and active developers, indicating sustained growth.Ecosystem Activity: Increase in onchain transactions and unique wallet interactions, reflecting network usage.Community Engagement: Growth in community size, RetroPGF participation, and Mission completion from participating developers.Educational Advancement: Improvements in developer skills and knowledge to ensure educational growth.Outreach Effectiveness: Reach, social media engagement, website traffic, and new user sign-ups to the game.Has anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?While originally conceiving the Mission Request, I spoke with several community members atOptimism Fractalevents who helped provide some inspiration for the idea.Additional InformationEligibility for Game DevelopersGame developers must meet specific criteria, including:Proven track record in developing games, preferably in Web3Strong technical understanding of the Superchain and OP StackCommitment to Optimism’s values and collaborative development towards the Optimistic VisionFunding AllocationOP tokens for game developers are locked for one year (in a similar way to prior builder grants)OP tokens may be distributed to players as participation incentives (in a similar way to prior growth experiment grants)"

DELEGATE CONDUCTUse values to guide actions.Maintain impartiality and transparency in participation.Rely on data, research and prior expertise for proposals and votes.Apply battle-tested internal policies for consistency.Consult with the team for quality outcomes.Our view on the Optimistic VisionAt StableNode, we believe that public funding is essential to developing a non-financial-driven web3. We believe that the focus should be on encouraging developers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods where a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to the space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for developers.Initially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current financial and political standards we have. The Optimistic vision details a necessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable and will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing the financial gain they would gain elsewhere.Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:This is a “Working” Constitution.Currently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing to see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation throughout the next few years.Decentralized governance is a relatively new field within Web3. It is an important topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems, such as voting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy, need to be tackled. We believe that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance methods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a protocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you so far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes experimentation.OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.This experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives through token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and allow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term improvement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive public funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner.Those individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this means reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house who have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward and see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.We favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the framework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders and delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is most likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the structure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it would be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities to the DAO.DisclosureThrough our holding company, we have invested in multiple projects to advance growth and governance for them. See the full listhere.We contribute to various protocols’ governance, such as MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, and Element.

Delegate Discovery Initiatives,"Delegate Discovery InitiativesOver the past few months, we’ve heard feedback from delegates that discoverability could be improved for smaller or less visible delegates. Below we outline a few lightweight ideas that could drive increased visibility to smaller delegates ahead of Season 4. Please provide feedback and/or additional suggestions ahead of next week’s community call (on 05/09). We’ll discuss which initiatives to put energy behind following the community call.Host an open design workshop with Agora to brainstorm delegate sorting mechanisms that provide viable alternatives to the current sorting mechanism, which is based on voting power or number of delegatorsRun a twitter campaign on@OptimismGov, where everyone can tag the delegates they believe deserve more delegation. This would create a public list delegators can refer to when delegatingAsk delegates with <0.5% voting power to recommend delegates with >0.25% voting power. This would also create a public list on the forum that delegators may refer to when delegating.We could experiment with “an elected delegation contract” that enables tokens to be delegated to a contract which would then pass that delegation through to a set of delegates determined via Token House election (eligibility may be subject to reqiurements such as KYC, etc.) If there is sufficient interest in setting up such a process, the Foundation could create or incorporate this into an RFP.Delegates mayregisterto participate in Tally’s upcomingdelegate week(May 22-26)[Your suggestions here]Suggestions from community call on 5.23.23Add a page to the Optimism Governance Portal that walks newcomers through why they should delegate and provides a step-by-step guide to doing soExperiment with ways to incentivize re-evaluation of delegates to make sure delegates are active and/or aligned– gasless re-delegation [Handful of protocols doing this during Delegation Week]– directly incentivizing people (with tokens) to re-affirm or re-evaluate their delegate [Hop is experimenting with this]– automatic expiration of delegation on periodic basis [Maker does this, with mixed results]Propose a Mission that is focused on bringing in x # of new delegates per SeasonAllow the locked OP allocated to Builders Grants to be delegated (various implementation options)Allow Citizens’ to endorse Token House badgeholders and create a corresponding sorting view on the delegate UI"

GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread,"This thread is intended to provide a record of GFX Labs’ voting and communication around the reasoning of each vote. Subsequent voting communications will be added to this thread over time.3 Polls Ending June 26Proposal ASummary:This is a batch vote for 24 grants, ranging from Chainlink to Synthetix to Gelato. It includes 23 different protocols, and a full list with requested amounts of OP and individual spending planscan be found here. This vote is to approve or deny all 24 grant requests together.Recommendation: Vote Yes.Batched approvals of grants are poor governance, as they remove oversight, overload voters, and generally bundle together spending in a way such that many stakeholders get a turn at funding. Optimism is in early days and requires developing a strong ecosystem for users, but we feel strongly that unrelated spending proposals should not be bundled together like this again in the future.Proposal BSummary:Thisproposalwould distribute a 1,000,000 OP grant to Uniswap. 200,000 OP of which would be earmarked for grants from Uniswap to builders on Optimism. The remaining 800,000 would be earmarked for liquidity mining on Uniswap Optimism.Recommendation: Vote Yes.While the pools to be incentivized have not yet been specified, Uniswap is core infrastructure and it is difficult to imagine a successful Optimism without a robust adoption of Uniswap, which also has a proven network effect that makes users and liquidity sticky after incentives eventually end.Proposal CSummary:Thisproposalwould distribute a 300,000 OP grant to 0x. The entirety would be earmarked for the 0x grants program, with an intent for at least 50% to be directed to NFT/gaming projects on Optimism.Recommendation: Vote Yes.Like Uniswap, 0x is known as an important piece of on-chain infrastructure. It also has a grants program with an established history and ability to channel funding. The focus on non-financial uses of Optimism hold the potential to create more diverse use cases for Optimism, and 0x’s recent shift into NFT infrastructure strongly suggest they have the expertise to distribute grants in that industry effectively.NB: GFX is having difficulty voting on Snapshot, which does not currently support multisig voting on Optimism. We use best practices for handling assets internally – including voting power that has been delegated – and utilize a multisig on our delegate address. We are attempting to find a workaround, but ultimately, Snapshot needs to support voting from multisig addresses."

For that reason I have decided to start this delegate communication thread.For simpler votes, I have used the “vote with reason” feature and you should be able to see all of the reasoning behind my votes in the Agora UIhere.Below I will outline my reasoning for the votes where I didn’t use the “vote with reason” feature, and for all future votes where the discussion is more complicated.For Season 4 mission proposal requests, my main questions in my voting logic were quite simple:Is the team the correct team to lead this mission on a skills/community level?Is the mission directly contributing to the rise of Ether’s Phoenix?Is this proposal a good faith attempto to improve the Collective, as opposed to a bad-faith attempt to grab governance funds?Does the requested amount of OP seem reasonable given the scope of the mission?All of my votes needed to answer “yes” on all 4 of these questions. I tried to lean towards giving the benefit of the doubt on these proposals in the case that I was on the fence on one of the questions.My votes for Season 4 mission proposals were as follows:Intent#1:Proposal 3B: Velodrome: Spread Awareness Through Direct Outreach and OnboardingProposal 3D: Create and Maintain the ‘Optimism Vision Reservoir’Proposal 3E: Optimistic Womxn Shinning in BlockchainProposal 3F: Let’s take the Optimistic Vision to LATAM with Espacio CriptoProposal 3G: Spread Optimistic values across Latam with SolowProposal 3I: ‘Thank Optimism - powered by ThriveCoin’Proposal 3J: Web3xplorer - A curated web platform to discover useful web3 apps, resources and tools,Proposal 3K: Rumbo Optimista - Hacia Ethereum Mexico The Event || Optimistic Road in the way to Ethereum MéxicoIntent#3:Proposal 1A: Superchain Governance DeepdiveProposal 1B: Fully Decentralized and Independent Oracle and Data InfrastructureProposal 1C: TechNERD ProgramProposal 1D: Extend the L1Block contract to store historical blockhash dataProposal 1E: Future-proofing UI/UX of OP nodesProposal 1F: Spearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols on OptimismIntent#4:Proposal 4B: The RetroPGF Podcast ***Proposal 4C: Delegate Corner PodcastProposal 4E: Improving Governance Accessibility through Praise and Contribution Based AttestationsProposal 4F: Pairwise: Tinder UX For Web3 Community SignalingProposal 4I: Velodrome: Fostering Inclusive Governance through Leading Optimism Builders and Long-term UsersProposal 4K: OP Governance Analytics DashboardProposal 4L:OPdelegate.com***Proposal 4M: NumbaNERD Program*** These two proposals I am the alliance lead on. Due to the approval-based voting and having no way to abstain, my interpretation was that it is OK to vote in favor of my own proposals. That said, I only had ~60k votes at the time and to be honest didn’t give this too much thought. Now that I have much more voting power, I will be sure to be more careful about votes like this in the future and solicit community feedback for any gray areas."

Why is it time to launch Airdrop 4?,"The biggest concern hot spot right now is undoubtedly the Bitcoin ETF. But regardless of whether it passes or not, the next hot spot will be the Ethereum Cancun upgrade. The biggest beneficiary of the Cancun upgrade is Ethereum’s L2. Of course, $OP, as one of the leaders, shoulders a heavy responsibility. In terms of marketing, $OP has always done a good job, so launching Airdrop 4 during the Cancun upgrade hype will be a good finishing touch.If the Bitcoin ETF is successfully passed, then not only the Cancun upgrade will be discussed, but also the Ethereum ETF, so the popularity will be infinitely amplified, there will be many opportunities, but there will also be a lot of competition. After all, there are already many L2s online in the market. Seizing every opportunity to market yourself and remain invincible is what $OP is doing and what it should be doing!It’s been 15 months since Mission Optimism. Users who have participated in this task have not yet received any rewards. Participating in tasks requires a lot of time and GAS fees. Therefore, I think the project team should consider this mission reward to be the main goal of Airdrop 4!"

Brichis - Delegate Communication Thread,"Delegate statementFirstly, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Bricia, although you’re welcome to call meBrichisand I am Co-Founder ofEthereum Mexico.My decision to become a delegate was sparked by discussions regarding the OP distribution for the Retroactive Funding that Ethereum Mexico received. When asked if anyone was interested in Public Goods, I responded with a resounding yes. It all seemed to fall into place. We weren’t aware of any other Mexican delegate involved in any protocol, and Optimism felt like the perfect choice for me. After exploring various aspects of web3 over the past year and a half, I had decided to zero in on Public Goods. The concept ofimpact = profitis disruptive, and I am excited about the prospect of being part of this future.OnApril 14th, I initiated an experiment within the experiment. I pondered:What would happen if a non-technical person with no experience in governance tried to become a delegate?As the experiment unfolds, I’ve come to recognize certain privileges that afford me spending hours reading Optimism’s Forum and Discord. Though it’s not an easy task, I believe this privilege obliges me to contribute to making Optimism’s governance more accessible.Conflict of Interest DisclosureI am a co-founder of Ethereum México.In May 2024 I received 1M OP from A16Z Delegation Program.Note:You may find that my initial decisions are based on straightforward reasoning, but rest assured, as I progress along my learning journey, I’ll undoubtedly enhance my decision-making processes."

[Request for feedback] Building a Farcaster frame as a governance tool to facilitate matchmaking between OP holders and delegates,"GM Optimists!TL;DR:We are building a Farcaster frame to help OP token holders seamlessly find an ideal match to delegate their OP.We are a small team supported by Raid Guild to build this MVP for Optimism to help increase the delegated supply of OP to active delegates and foster deeper alignment between delegates and delegators. We also want to bring Raid Guild closer to the Optimism ecosystem.We are taking inspiration from Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) to create a Delegate Match Application (DMA) for Optimism. Voting Advice Applications are online tools designed to help voters identify which political parties or candidates most closely align with their personal views and preferences. Users answer a series of questions about key issues, and the VAA matches their responses with the positions of various political parties or candidates. The outcome is usually a percentage score or a list showing which parties or candidates the user aligns with most closely, thus aiding in making informed voting decisions.VAAs have been widely used across Europe. By providing voters with tools to easily compare their own policy preferences to those of various parties, VAAs have significantly improved electoral participation and the quality of democratic governance.We aim to adapt this model and build this application for the Optimism community in the open to make a more user-centric MVP. For that, we invite you to participate in the process. Please share your thoughts about these questions or any other insights in the comments and fill out the poll.For Delegates:What are the key aspects or values you believe are crucial for OP holders to understand about your governance philosophy?How do you prefer to communicate your decisions and actions to the community?For OP Holders:What factors do you consider most important when choosing a delegate?What information do you find most valuable in making your delegation decisions?How many questions would be ideal to find a good fit, but not discourage you from finishing?For anyone:What other contentious or non-contentious topics could better align OP holders with a specific delegate?Topics for Matchmaking:We are considering various topics to facilitate effective matchmaking between OP holders and delegates. Which of these do you find relevant? select all that apply.Commitment vs. Curriculum: Should the focus in choosing council and board members be on their commitment to Optimism, experience in Optimism, or professional background, even if they are new to the collective?Grants and RPGF Ideology: Would you prefer funding a few well-established projects with high potential for impact or supporting several emerging projects showing initial impact?Decentralization Pace: Should we accelerate towards a fully decentralized collective, or advocate for a steady transition from the foundation to the collective?Funding OSS vs VC Ventures: How should we balance funding between VC-backed ventures and open-source initiatives?Delegate Engagement: How important is it for a delegate to have active communication channels detailing their voting decisions and rationale?Demographic Matching: Do you see value in delegators being able to filter matches based on demographic factors like gender, region, or language?0votersThis post will serve as a living document, updated based on feedback and the project’s evolution.We will also conduct some interviews with delegates, delegators, govnerds, members of the OP foundation, OP labs, and other stakeholders. Please feel free to DM@cotabehere or on TG (same handle everywhere) if you want to participate in a short interview or support this effort.Please share your thoughts about the matchmaking topics, other topics that we might have missed.  Thank you for your engagement and support.Stay Optimistic!"
Jack anorak - delegate communication thread,"I scatter my opinions everywhere but will try to maintain an ongoing record in a single place.Current votes are on the Grants Council, the Protocol Delegation Program, and Badgeholder votes.I voted for the grants council and the protocol delegation program – I’ve been an advocate for movement in these directions, and these are really thoroughly thought out. Feedback sessions on these have been fun and constructive.Re badgeholders: everyone on the list is fantastic; choosing between them seems futile. The only real alternative I could imagine to voting for the individuals I nominated, which I’m doing, is voting for everyone, which felt unhelpful.The one exception I’m granting myself is voting for Juanbug because he went an extra step and asked for my support. We also go back – he’d been following veDao and volunteered to be on our multisig (didn’t happen), and that’s always stuck with me as an example of enthusiastic, proactive citizenship."

Tribuni Alpha Launch: Telegram Mini-app Built by Delegates for Delegates,"Being a delegate requires constantly staying up-to-date due to the sheer volume of information that needs to be digested. I experienced this firsthand during my time as the governance co-lead at@blockchainatusc.To address this pain point, we are excited to announce the alpha launch of the Tribuni Telegram Mini-app, a governance info aggregation app built by and for delegates.Tribuni Interface1920×693 149 KBTribuni allows delegates toreceive alertson live proposals, getproposal summaries, and stay updated on the superchain ecosystems such as Optimism, Synthetix, Frax, and more. We chose Telegram as our platform because it has the highest concentration of crypto users and offers a mobile-first, all-in-one experience. This allows users to receive updates seamlessly without needing to switch between different apps, which helps to reduce the tooling silo in governance, making it more engaging and convenient for users. This project emerged from theETH Denver 2024 hackathon, and we have continued to develop it since then.We would like to extend our gratitude to all the beta testers (@Juanbug_PGov@brichis@katie@rshuel@LauNaMu@v3naru_Curia@chaselb@jayyu23) for their invaluable help and feedback.

Is completing a GOV Mission outside of the GOV RPGF round scope?,"Hey fam, its Alberto from InBest & ETH Costa Rica here.I write with some surprise upon seeing that three voters have disqualified our team’s work, i would like to just ask the following 3 questions:1) Is a full university module about Optimism considered a “promotional initiative”?Screenshot 2024-10-21 at 4.24.24 PM722×624 50.4 KB2) Is the successful completion of a governance mission considered “outside of scope” for a governance round?Screenshot 2024-10-21 at 4.24.45 PM712×618 11.7 KB3) If the collective wants this to continue happening, shouldn’t we support the leaders who are fulfilling these missions?Screenshot 2024-10-21 at 4.29.22 PM2602×1338 485 KBTo provide context, our team has been leading governance efforts within Optimism. We successfully completed the mission called“Integrate Optimism Governance in University Module.”Our team at Inbest and Ethereum Costa Rica executed this mission perfectly.Please note that growth mission grants are meant to grow the Superchain—in this case, governance. The tokens allocated must be 100% distributed to the students, with no incentive for the team to do it other than a future RPGF. In fact, a council member informed us at that time, that the impact should be rewarded in a future RPGF.As this is an RPGF for governance, we believe this is the most appropriate round for our project, which has been extremely successful, surpassing even our expectations! This success is due to the tremendous effort by the team, in terms of time, money, and energy, overcoming challengues and the bureaucracy involved in running a full university course.All information about the module was detailed on the governance forum.Thank you for your support! please feel free to comment, we want to know your opinion.LINK TO THE GOVERNANCE MISSION FORUM POST:OPTIMISM University Module in Costa RicaTagging a few people whose opinions I would really like to hear:@op_julian@Gonna.eth@LauNaMu@brichis@opmike@Pumbi@Jonas@jackanorak@katieAlbertoInBestETH Costa Rica"
Retro Funding 6: Application Review Process,"The Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) application review process is applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro rounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria. This process is run by a selected group of Citizens during a 2 week period following the project sign up process. For a full overview of the application review process seeRetro Funding: Application Review Process.Reviewer ExpectationsAny Citizen who participates in the review process should meet the following expectationsTime Commitment:As a reviewer you should expect to commit a minimum of 10 hours to participating in the review process. There’s a need for you to have ongoing availability during the process running from October 14 - October 28.OP Governance:You should have high level familiarity with the OP Governance and its components to enforce the eligibility criteria. Please make sure you understand and are comfortable with enforcing theeligibility criteriabefore you sign up.Communication & Synch calls:Stay attentive to messages, announcements, and action steps provided by the Lead Reviewers. Attend the onboarding call and attend regular reviewer sync calls.Stick to the rules: Thoroughly review applications according to the application review checklist. You need to provide a written explanation for your review. Diverting from the rules to implement your personal values is unacceptable and will result in removal from the review process.Conflicts of Interest:You are required to declare projects you have a conflict of interest with when applying to be a reviewer. Badgeholders with a COI will not be able to participate in the round.Reviewer SelectionCitizens will be selected as Reviewers via a combination of an opt-in process and random sampling. This allows for a smaller group to engage in the process, while still being fairly selected via random sampling.Opt-in:Citizens can opt-in to participate in the application review process until Oct 11th 19:00 UTC. Only Citizens can participate who do not have a Conflict of Interest with a project applying to the round.To opt-in please fill outthis formand be sure you have read the Reviewer Expectations listed above.Random Sampling:22 reviewers will be randomly selected from the citizens who have opted-in to review. Selection will take place on October 11th and citizens will be notified via email about the outcome of the random selection.Lead Reviewers:Diego, the Citizens’ House Gov NERD, will act as a non-voting lead reviewer, responsible for resolving questions, collecting votes, managing the timeline of the process and facilitating collaboration.Reviewer Groups:Instead of randomly assigning reviewers to cases, there will be 4 reviewer groups with 5 reviewers each. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to a group. This design aims at reducing the operational and technical complexity, as well as allow for more collaboration among reviewers.Application Review Process OverviewApplication is submittedviaretrofunding.optimism.ioApplication is assignedto reviewer group (see “Reviewer Selection”)Appeal:If a majority of reviewers rejected the application, the applicant can hand in an appeal. The appeal will then be reviewed by 5 reviewers from a different reviewer group to the one that did the initial review. The reviewer group decides if the application is rejected/approved by majority vote.Application Edits:Edits to a project’s application are only allowed in cases where the application form itself is misguided or deceived applications, bugs caused input errors or the application category was selected wrong. The Foundation decides which applications are allowed to be edited. Relevant edits are made following the Full Review and are considered within the Appeals process.Application rulesBelow are rules for which violation will result in the removal of an application from a Retro Funding round.False statements & deception- false claims about your contributions, past impact or funding & grants are not allowed.Hateful Content- No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination as defined by therules of engagementDeceiving badgeholders- Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users.Fraud & Impersonation- Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project; the funds must go to the project.Advertising- Using Retro Funding application to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT dropOutside of Retro round scopeor not meeting eligibility criteria - Contributions that do not have a clear relationship to the scope of the retro round, or do not meet eligibility criteriaSpam- Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links. Applications in languages other than English .This will help simplify the process as English is the working language of the majority of Badgeholders. Please ensure you translate any content that’s part of the application.Duplicate applications- Multiple applications from the same individual, project or group which apply for the same impact.Members ofcontribution paths(Council Members, Ambassadors, NumbaNERDs, SupNERDs, TechNERDs, Translators) or Councils can’t submit individual applications for their work within the relevant workstream, as each workstream will apply as a project.Review ChecklistReviewers will be asked to go over this checklist when performing the initial review of an application. Please note that this is an early draft.Spam:Does the application contain spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links? Is the application in another language than English?Eligibility:Is this application Eligible, following the eligibility criteria of the round? [Referencecategory specific criteria checklist]Category:Is this application eligible for another category, different to the one they have selected?Optimism Grants:Has the application correctly reported the grants they have received from Optimism (including Token House, Citizens’ House an Foundation grants)?Venture Funding:Has the application correctly reported their venture funding based on public information?Pricing:Has the application correctly reported their current pricing? See by checking the pricing on the projects website.Impersonation:Does the application have a verified Github repo which belongs to the organisation they claim to be? Do any linked artefacts not belong to the project?Future promises:Does this application make promises about work they will do in the future?Advertising:Does this application actively promote a token or NFT sale in their application or on their website?Conflicts of Interest ruleA large number of citizens will apply with their project to Retro Funding 6. To prevent possible bias within the review process, only citizens without a Conflict of Interest with a project in the round will be allowed to participate."
Retro Funding 6: Announcing Guest Voter participation,"Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 6 was recently announced, and will award OP to contributions made to the Optimism Collective governance system. As part of Round 6, a set of Guest Voters will be invited to participate alongside Citizens. Similar to theexperiment in Round 5, the goal is to learn more about different voter selection mechanisms as a way to create a foundation of knowledge that can be used when making decisions about Citizen selection in the future.Research QuestionsThere are two primary research questions inspiring this experiment:Do selection methods that aim to select for specific characteristics (such as Web of Trust or Proof of Work) result in a significantly different group composition than random selection?Do randomly selected voters make resource allocation decisions that are significantly different from voters selected via Web of Trust / Proof of Work? Are we able to assess those differences to be better / worse?The first research question derives from a hypothesis that selection methods are better than random chance at selecting for specific characteristics. We currently have two cohorts of voters that were selected with a specific selection method: Citizens that were selected via Web of Trust and Round 5 Guest Voters that were selected via Proof of Work. Without a control group, we cannot make any assumptions about the effectiveness of these methods in selecting specific characteristics. Randomly selecting a set of Guest Voters enables us to create this control group and use this group as a baseline against which to compare the two previously selected groups as well as future groups.The second research question goes a level deeper to try and understand whether deliberately selected voters actually perform differently on the allocation task than a random group of people. Once again the current experiment can be thought of as the creation of a control group against which to compare Citizens. Having a control group is valuable as it allows us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the ‘treatment’. In this case, the treatment is ‘being selected via Web of Trust’. If the control group is found to vote in a similar way to Citizens, then there is no effect of ‘being selected via Web of Trust’ on the outcome, which is the Retro Funding allocation.Experiment Outcome MeasuresResearch Question 1Do selection methods that aim to select for specific characteristics (such as Web of Trust or Proof of Work) result in a significantly different group composition than random selection?The following outcomes will be measured to address the first research question:Social graph modularity of Guest VotersProfessional background / occupation of Guest VotersEngagement and alignment of Guest Voters with the Optimism CollectiveThese measures will be analyzed partially through data associated with Guest Voters’ Farcaster Accounts and linked Ethereum accounts, and partially through data collected in an onboarding survey. The outcomes will be compared with similar measures made for Round 5 Guest Voters and Citizens.Research Question 2Do randomly selected voters make resource allocation decisions that are significantly different from voters selected via Web of Trust / Proof of Work? Are we able to assess those differences to be better / worse?The following outcomes will be measured to address the second research question:Voting behavior (time spent voting, number of metrics selected etc.)OP allocation patterns (allocation distribution curve, min and max allocation, median allocation, delta between allocation and ratings provided in impact attestations)The votes of Citizens and other stakeholders on which overall allocation was perceived to be ‘better’ that of the Guest Voters or Citizens.Experiment OperationsIn order to address the research questions above, a set of voters must be randomly selected. There are a few high-level requirements of this random selection mechanism:It mustn’t select the same person twice (i.e. one-person-one-vote)It must select from the general population of Superchain usersThere should be as little bias in the sample as possibleThe first step of random selection is defining the population. Once the population is defined, a random number generator can be used to randomly select a set of individuals.There are a few ways to think about defining the population. One is to make an announcement allowing anyone to register their interest, and then randomly select from the set that registered. However, this approach introduces a lot of bias into the sample because the population to be sampled from is skewed towards individuals that are highly engaged with Optimism.A preferable way to randomly select participants is to define the population as broadly as possible, randomly select individuals and reach out to them with an invitation to participate. There will still be some bias in the sample, but considerably less than if the opt-in process happens prior to the random selection.The goal is therefore to define a representative population of Superchain users, where there is a low probability that the same person is selected twice, and there is the ability to reach selected individuals with an invitation to participate. After reviewing several options, we decided to sample from the population of active Farcaster accounts. This is because:The Farcaster Protocol runs on OP Mainnet, so Farcaster users are users of the SuperchainIt is possible to reach any Farcaster user via cast or DMThe population is large enough - all Farcaster accounts is ~750,000 users, with ~50,000 being active dailyThe population is likely representative of the larger set of active Superchain users - creating a social account is a common action and the set is unlikely to be skewed towards any specific characteristicWhile some users have multiple Farcaster accounts, the rate of user:account is probably lower than the rate of user:Ethereum accountRandom sampling processStarting with all Farcaster accounts that were created…Filter out business accounts (we want people, not organizations)Filter out existing Citizens and Round 5 Guest VotersFilter out accounts that have had zero Farcaster activity in the last 3 monthsRun a script to randomly select votersReach out to voters with the invitation to participateRun the script again to select new voters to fill the remaining unfilled slots until the target number of Guest Voters has been reachedWhat about Sybils?While the probability that two accounts belonging to the same person are selected in a set of tens or hundreds of thousands of accounts is low, we must still consider Sybil-resistance in the experiment design.All Guest Voters are required to participate in an onboarding process that includes a video call requiring active participation. Voters that don’t participate will not receive a voting badge.Experiment DesignRetro Funding 6 will see the participation of a record number of Guest Voters. Approximately 100 Guest Voters will participate alongside roughly the same number of Citizens. The purpose of inviting such a large cohort of Guest Voters is to maintain experiment conditions that have a similar number of participants.While Guest Voters will participate in the allocation task under the same conditions as Citizens, at the end of the round their votes may be counted differently.Citizens will be able to review the aggregated voting results of Guest Voters and cast a final vote on whether to integrate the votes of Guests at a 1:1 ratio, or whether to diminish the aggregate voting power of the Guest cohort by 25%, 50% or 100%. This process will act as a fail-safe in case the system is captured by Guest Voters."

Retro Funding 6: Impact Attestation experiment,"A reoccurring request by badgeholders has been to access more third party data on projects’ impact, instead of solely relying on information projects have provided themselves. For many offchain contributions, we’re missing standardized reliable data which can be surfaced to measure impact. The hypothesis behind this small-scale experiment is that attestations by governance actors on the impact of Governance Infrastructure & Tooling projects will support badgeholders in making more informed voting decisions in Retro Funding 6.OverviewIn Retro Funding 6, the Collective will experiment with collecting data on the impact of different governance contributions via attestations. The goal is to produce standardized verifiable data which provides value to badgeholders.Timeline: Impact Attestations will be collected from Oct 14th til Oct 23rdScope Categories:Impact attestations as part of this experiment are limited to contributions within the “Governance Infrastructure & Tooling” category.Participation: Top 100 Delegates,  Citizens and  governance leadership functions will be asked to participate in issuing impact attestations. It’s essential that participants use addresses which hold relevant reputation, such as delegate or citizen role. For the output of this process to be meaningful, the experiment should have participation from at least 40 Citizens, 40 Top 100 delegates, and various governance leadership functions. Participants should not attest to the impact of their own projects.Experiment OutputThe aim of the experiment is to generate relevant insights about the impact of Governance Infrastructure and Tooling to support the Retro Funding 6 voting process. Insights derived from the attestation data will be served to existing badgeholders on the relevant project page. These insights will not be surfaced to guest voters, to not impact the experiment conditions of thevoter selectionexperiment. You can see an early iteration on how this information could be surfaced to badgeholders below.image1440×1984 139 KBTo measure the success of the experiment, badgeholders will be asked to rate the value this information provided in the ballot submission survey.Issuing Impact Attestations via Impact GardenUsers will be able to generate Impact Attestations via Impact Garden to ensure the data gathered is standardized and enables comparison. Impact Garden’s work has significantly shaped the design of this experiment, you can read more about ithere.Impact Attestations have two core components:ReputationQualitative data standardizationReputationFarcaster account: we will leverage the Farcaster account of the rater to identify their roles within the Optimism Collective, both past and present. This is done by querying all attestations issued to any of their verified wallets.Bonus: Using the Farcaster username reduces the possibility for sybil attacks as we can leverage the social graph and information of the attestors, while creating a loop in which we enrich that same social graph with information on governance participation.Onchain attestations: Each Impact Attestation will reference the project being attested to onchain. By doing so, we continue to increase the onchain information available on the reputation of contributors to the Optimism Collective.Qualitative data standardizationEvery reviewer will be asked to answer 3 questions to ensure their views can be aggregated and analyzed in a comparable way. Measuring these metrics over time will also enable us to identify if the tool has improved or decayed and the continued relevance of it to the members of the Collective.Q1. How likely are you to recommend this tool to someone in your role or position?This question is akin to the Net Promoter Score measurement, through it we’re looking to understand how satisfied members of the Collective are with this tool and the service it has provided them with in the past. We hope that this question will also provide insights into the usefulness of a tool beyond the dependency it has for our systems.Q2.  How would you feel if this contribution ceased to exist?Through this question, we look to understand the dependency governance members of the collective have to these different tools to perform their day to day functions, or their role specific functions (Retro voting, etc).Q3. Brief explanation for your ratingWe have included an open ended question to allow raters to share additional valuable information on their answers to question 1 and 2. This information can surface particular benefits that have been derived and allow for more precise tuning for voters decisions.Simple vs complex impact relationshipsGovernance infrastructure & Tooling projects are a good fit for this experiment, as these projects usually have a direct user relationship, which can represent their impact. One can measure the impact of a governance tool by understanding how much utility it has provided to actors within the governance system.This is not true for all governance contributions. Measuring the impact of a Council, such as the Grants Council, is more complex, requiring multiple types of data that increase the complexity of the experiment.A look forwardThis experiment marks a first step into the frontier of generating standardized data to measure the impact of offchain projects. Below are principals which guide the experiment and possible future iterations:Rich reputation graph: It is essentially to understand who the users are that are deriving impact from a project and what their role is within the Optimism Collective. This requires the population of a rich reputation graph. The Collective already has madesignificant progress within this area, issuing attestations for relevant governance roles and building out builder information withinOP Atlas.Broad participation: For the collected data to be high signal, reliable, and robust, the process requires broad participation of actors within the Collective.Integrated: signals on impact, such as impact attestations, should become integrated into the experience of using a project, rather than being an activity in itself. At its best, the user is not required to take any additional actions to signal impact. This aids in ensuring broad participation and even coverage."

Joan's RPGF5 Reflections,"In line with what I did forRPGF3andRPGF4, I will use this thread to share my reflections concerning RPGF5.In this first post I will collect my take-aways from the process of participating as areviewerandappeals reviewerin RPGF5.And then I’ll return later to share my reflections on thevoting processin a second post.PreconditionsRound scopeRPGF5is designed to reward contributors to the OP Stack. Impact must have been generated between October 2023 - August 2024, and the following 3 categories are recognized:Ethereum Core ContributionsOP Stack Research & DevelopmentOP Stack ToolingAs application turnout for the round was lower than expected, the round design was updated toallow voters to decide on the round sizingwith the stipulation that the token allocation should be no less than 2M OP, and no more than 8M OP.Basic voting designAlong with the total allocation, each voter is asked to vote on the distribution of funds between the three mentioned categories, and on the distribution of funds between the individual applicants within one of the categories.Each category will be assignedtwo groups of voters: A group of expert voters (guests and citizens) and a group of non-expert (citizens only) voters.Review ProcessMain overall impressionFrom a reviewer standpoint, the RPGF4 review left me with two main wishes: More clarity around what reviewers need or need not check, and better software tools available to reviewers.In RPGF5, we took a big step forward with regard to clarity on the review task. The software tools also improved somewhat - though I would have to say that I believe that there is still room for further improvement.Clarity, objectivity and consistencyWhereas I’m generally in favour of recognizing subjective evaluation as a perfectly valid part ofthe voting process, I seereviewersas administrative workers tasked with upholding a set of predefined rules and criteria on behalf of the community. In order to be able to do this reliably and consistently, the guidelines must be clear and actionable, and there should be little room or need for personal opinions in the process.In RPGF5 I was very happy to see the introduction of a reviewer’s checklist which attempted to turn the abstract application rules into concrete checks for the reviewers to perform, as well as a list of specific rejection reasons that corresponded 1:1 with the checklist items.Much discussion came out of this - arguably the round eligibility criteria were lacking some nuances, forcing reviewers to reject applications that they would have very much liked to include in the round. Looking at the bigger picture, though, I consider this review round a success:The review task was much clearer to me than in previous rounds, discussions among reviewers were much more focused around the defined criteria and their limits, and it seems to me that the outcome was a higher degree of concensus among reviewers on what projects must be rejected and why.Also, when you can’t just make exceptions based on personal whims, any problems with the defined rules become very clear. I’m sure that this will help shape the rules and checklists in future rounds.SoftwareI was invited to help check out Charmverse’s updates before the review was kicked off. Thanks,@Jonasand@ccarella!I enjoyed doing a bit of testing, some issues were definitely improved in this round, and I would be happy to take part in this bit of the process again in the future.It would be awesome if the test process could over time become a bit more organized with clearer follow-up on the issues found - at least, as a tester, what you always wish to know when you have done your bit is: What issues will the developer team try to tackle, and (when) is further testing needed?There is a great difference between “trying the new software to confirm that it works” and “testing with the objective of finding both obvious and less obvious issues and improvement potentials”. I could see this turning into a regular OP contribution path over time.Hours spentI didn’t time myself, but I believe I spent about 25 hours in total on the review process (not including the testing mentioned above, but including watching the kickoff recording, reviewing ~100 applications, doing some background research, discussing with other reviewers, handling appeals and taking notes for this post).A norm of 15 minutes per review had been discussed in the context of the Collective Feedback Commission previous to the review round, and I think this round supported this estimate.In contrast to previous rounds, I felt that my time was generally spent on productive and focused work in this round.Improvements and future requestsBelow, I will share a list of quick notes on what I see as the biggest achievements in this review round, and the most important things that I would love to see improve in future rounds.I’m happy to comment on any of these if needed - just ask.ImprovementsAs already mentioned, the reviewer checklist and rejection reasons that 1:1 represented the items on the reviewer checklist were a BIG step up!There were quite a large number of applications per reviewer, but assigning reviewers to 1-2 categories was helpful in easing the mental load.Having small predefined reviewer teams supported accountability (visibility and, I think, a nice sense of team spirit).It was great to have private Telegram channels for reviewer discussions! Good conversations, supportive atmosphere. Also, nice to be able to see channels for all categories for context and inspiration.The new ‘My Work’ tab in Charmverse was awesome!Future requestsI would like more clarity around how to handle projects that seem to (somewhat) fit several categories. If we include them everywhere, they are likely to be rewarded multiple times for the same impact; if we exclude them, they run the risk of not being accepted in a future round and end up without rewards.The application rules / eligibility criteria should say something about the eligibility of projects that have already been rewarded in previous RPGF rounds.It would be good for reviewers and voters alike to have API access to all application data. OP Atlas was mentioned once or twice in the review process, but I don’t know how to access the data there… is there a way to do that?There were still some issues around data integrity (missing github and organizational information). Issues were being handled as they surfaced, but for this reason too it would be good to be able to access the original data somehow in cases of doubt.Often, important details are clarified in the review process. Reviewers and applicants both contribute with various comments and discussions. Appeals also tend to contain a lot of important context. It would be good, I think, to spend some time considering how this information can best be carried over into the voting round.It would be nice for all reviewers to have full read access to comments related to all applications under review. Right now, it seems like we only have access to the applications to which we are directly assigned. Having access to all would give better transparency and context.While the new ‘My Work’ tab was great, I missed being able to sort applications based on various criteria, especially Category.I sorely missed being able to open applications in a new tab/window in CharmverseThe UI should make sure that reviewers always leave a text comment to explain their thinking when they reject an application, along with the specific rejection reason from the predefined list.There were some difficulties related to the way applicants were asked to represent themselves in terms of organizational structure and projects. Reviewers need to be able to easily see which organization a project/application belongs to, and a list of all projects/applications belonging to a given organization.Even so, applicants should be adviced to make sure that all needed information is included in every application! There were cases where applicants referred to funding information given in another application - which not only makes the reviewer’s job more complex, but also poses an obvious problem for voters if only one of these applications actually makes it into the voting round.In Charmverse, it would be nice to be able to see the voting status for each application in the overview (one’s own vote AND the total number of votes for and against)In the list of rejection reasons, adding a “Wrong category” option would probably help streamline the process.As a very small detail, the ‘hidden’ private “Reviewer notes” in Charmverse (top right corner link in the individual application view) are not useful and should probably just be removed to avoid potential misunderstandings.Oh… And the bug that causes all reviewer votes to be reset if the last reviewer decides to undo his votereallyshould be fixed."

These activities are rewarded separately as part of theRetro Governance Participation RewardsEach of the above mentioned Councils, Commissions, Advisory Boards and NERD programs are required to submit one application as a group, individual participation within one of the groups is not eligible. The allocation of rewards among group members should be proposed by the team Lead and is subject to the consensus mechanism of that group outlined in their internal operating proceduresGovernance Leadership within Governance Season 4 is not considered within this round, as it was already rewarded in Retro Funding 3.Retro Funding 6 SizeCitizens will vote on the round’s OP allocation within the rounds voting experience. The Foundation is assigning a minimum OP Amount for the round of 1.1M OP and a maximum OP amount of 3.5m OP. Citizens will be able to vote for an OP amount within the range of minimum and maximum which they believe appropriately rewards the impact within the round. The round allocation will be decided by taking the median of Citizens’ votes.The voting on the rounds OP allocation is an experiment in community-lead budget allocation.The outcomes of this experiment will inform the evolution of the budgeting process in the future, which is subject to change based on learnings.The following are considerations for the minimum and maximum values set by the Foundation:Retro Funding 3 benchmark: Approximately 1.1M OP was allocated to Optimism Governance Contributions in Retro Funding 3 at the end of 2023. The minimum round allocation for Retro Funding 6 matches this value, under the assumption that impact within Optimism Governance has been consistent or has increased since the last round.Optimism Governance growth: Within the scope period of October 2023 until September 2024, Optimism Governance has grown significantly. Within the timeframe a number of new governance leadership roles, such as the Developer Advisory Board, Security Council, TH & CH Feedback Commissions, Anticapture Commission have been introduced. The infrastructure and tooling which Optimism Governance relies on has been extended, introducing approval ranking in the Token House, partial delegation, Citizens’ House Protocol upgrade veto rights, Retro Funding sign up tooling and more. To reflect his growth, the Foundation set a maximum OP allocation of 3.5m OP.Voting DesignFor the round, a number of guest voters will be selected to further drive understanding on how different voter selection methods impact resource allocation decisions. You can learn more about the Retro Funding 6 Guest voter selection experimenthere.Retro Funding 6 will adopt the voting design from round 5, where voters are sorted into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications. Incremental improvements will be made to the voting experience based on the feedback from voters in round 5.Additionally, asmall scale experiment on impact attestationswill be part of the round, testing the collection of more community generated data to support voters in evaluating impact.KYC & Grant DeliveryThe Optimism Foundation is making continuous improvements on the KYC & Grant delivery process. Grantswill be streamed to recipients over 100 days, following the announcement of results and approval of KYC. Superfluid is providing infrastructure for the streaming of Retro Funding grants.

Optimism Retro Funding – Voting Design Evaluation,"GovXS-badgeholderevent1200×675 72.3 KBTLDR; The future of Optimism Retro Funding is built on its past! Optimism Badgeholders and GovNERDs, don’t miss your chance to discover:1) Brand-new insights from comparing voting designs across Retro Funding Rounds 1-42) A new evaluation framework for assessing future voting rules3) Data-driven proposals for improved voting designs and performance metricsRegister and take part at the workshop on Monday, September 23, from 17:00-18:00 UTC here!Optimism Retro Funding is one of the most visionary endeavors in the crypto space. Instead of funding based on future potential, it retroactively compensates work that has proven valuable for the Optimism Ecosystem and offers a sustainable model for individuals to receive rewards. Round by round, the decision on reward distribution is decided by a vote in the Optimism Citizens House.TheGovXS teamwas chosen to evaluate voting designs for Optimism Retro Funding through theFoundation Mission Request: Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding.The objective: Improve Optimism governance accessibility and grow the Optimism Collective’s understanding of optimal voting designs to encourage diverse, informed, and values-aligned voting behavior.Delivering on this objective, GovXS developed a new voting evaluation framework drawing fromSocial Choice Theory. We apply theoretical analysis and agent-based simulations to assess past Retro Funding voting designs across six dimensions:1. Resistance to malicious behavior and collusion:Measure to what extent a malicious voter (or a group of coordinated malicious voters) can impact voting outcomes2. Incentive compatibility:Prove or disprove that the voting design isincentive compatible(”every participant can achieve their own best outcome by acting according to their true preferences”)3. Simplicity for Voters & Expected Outcome:Measure if voters can easily understand how the voting design works and how to best achieve their goals4. Majority & Diversity:Measure if results represent preference of majority or diversity of voters5. Incentives Alignment:Measure how well the incentives of voters and the Optimism Collective are aligned6. Alignment with Ground Truth in Impact = Profit:Measure how well the voting design supports finding the objective truth in “impact = profit”.The GovXS Voting Evaluation Framework is now available to evaluate voting designs in Retro Funding rounds. Its metrics enable straightforward comparisons, helping select the best-fit designs for each round’s scope while ensuring strong and reliable voting outcomes. Optimism Badgeholders and GovNERDS will be among the first to access and explore the GovXS Voting Evaluation Framework byregistering to attend our workshop on Monday, September 23, 2024, at 5pm UTC.In this session, the GovXS team will walk you through the key components of the framework, and showcase the results reviewing past voting designs from Rounds 1–4. This workshop will guide you through GovXS’ evaluation and recommendations to improve future rounds’ voting designs and performance metrics.This event is exclusively for Badgeholders, GovNERDS, guest voters and members of the Optimism Collective. Meet the GovXS researchersNimrod Talmon, PhD,Angela Kreitenweis,Eyal Briman, andMuhammad Idrees, and learn and discuss together!GovXS is a research initiative under Token Engineering Academy, which aims to propel the success of crypto protocols with cutting-edge research in the new, crypto-native discipline of token engineering.See you there!"
Voting UX for Retro Funding 5,"In Retro Funding 5: OP Stack, the Optimism Foundation designed a new Voting UX for badgeholders (aka voters). Based on past learnings, our key objectives were to enablemore focus & better decision makingamong voters.In round 3, there were over 600 projects and each required review. Badgeholders reported spending 20-30 hours in that grueling review process. In round 5, we increased focus by dramatically reducing the number of projects under review (we achieved this by reducing each round’s overall scope).In addition to reducing the project count, we also decreased the cognitive load required to review projects, rank them, and allocate rewards.We introduced voting subcategories. In round 3, it was difficult to compare projects because they were often very different from one another. In round 5, badgeholders only review projects that are like one another.We introduced an impact scoring system. Voters first consider each project’s impact in isolation before allocating OP.We introduced allocation methods. These are opinionated algorithms that help voters allocate OP across their ranked ballot.Retro Funding voters set budgets, compare projects, consider their impact, and decide on rewards. It’s a big commitment, and it’s a lot of work. Our voting UX won’t solve for everything (much of the work will still happen outside the voting app in forums, on discord, on telegram, etc), but we aimed to provide a more consistent, helpful, and dynamic tool than voters had seen before—so they can submit a more confident vote.Note that in this breakdown, I use the terms badgeholder and voter interchangeably.welcome3552×2354 199 KBIn round 5, 79 OP Stack projects were approved across three categories: Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research & Development, and OP Stack Tooling. Each badgeholder reviews projects within only one of the categories (20-30 projects per badgeholder), a major reduction compared to past rounds.budget3552×2354 344 KBTo start the process, badgeholders vote on the overall budget. This is the first time they’ve been asked to do this, and we understand it’s a big question. To assist their reasoning, we provide contextual information in the right hand column.Next, they decide how much of the budget should be given to each category. They can dig into category details and view the projects within them. The tool previews OP amounts as they edit their percentage inputs.score1920×1272 101 KBWhen ready, voters move onto the scoring step.In previous rounds, they went from reviewing projects directly to allocating OP. This meant that ranking projects, determining impact, and assigning OP was unguided and incredibly difficult. Feedback indicated that this led to overly simplified decision making.In round 5, badgeholders first score each project before “unlocking” their ballot. Project pages cleanly and consistently display impact statements and other metadata, and we hide non-essential information for improved comprehension of key information.When scoring, a project’s impact is considered in isolation. We think this will result in a fair and thoughtful assessment of each project apart from the others. In regards to focus, voters once again benefit. They defer any thinking about a project’s relative impact and OP allocation until after they’ve scored every project in their category.For an alternative to scoring, voters can usePairwise—a great tool for comparing projects.score-github3552×2354 288 KBObjective metrics are super useful when comparing projects. The crew at Open Source Observer helped bring more objectivity into the voting process by providing metrics on GitHub repositories which we present here.Check outCarl’s forum postfor more on GitHub metrics.unlock1920×1272 40.4 KBThe ballot is unlocked after every project has been scored.Projects are sorted by highest to lowest score. Thanks to the scoring process, badgeholders are now familiar with every project in their voting category, and they can easily review their ballot rankings for accuracy. They can revisit a project to change its score, or they can simply drag and drop to adjust its position in the ballot.ballot3552×2828 268 KBNext, voters can explore allocation methods.Voters choose a preset and the method fills their ballot percentages from top-to-bottom. These methods are a starting point, meant to simplify the process of allocating OP.  To choose a method, voters just have to decide across a few variables. For impact groups, did projects that were scored the same deliver similar impact? For top-to-bottom, does my ranked list represent a fairly even separation of impact? For top weighted, are the projects at the top of my ranked list much more impactful than the ones at the bottom?We expect that most badgeholders will start with an allocation method, then customize their ballot from there. We hope the presets are useful, helping voters more quickly make judgements that feel fair to them.Tangentially, it’s important to note that at any point badgeholders can return to the budget step. Reviewing the impact of 20-30 projects could make them reconsider the round budget. We designed the system flexibly, so they could make budget edits at any time.voted1920×1272 52.6 KBWe expect this version of the voting app to result in more focus for badgeholders, and to aid in better decision making—ultimately increasing confidence in the vote.Retro Funding is a massive initiative with many dimensions needing consideration and balance—and we appreciate any feedback that helps us improve. If you want to demo the app, you can do it here:https://round5.optimism.io/.Much appreciation to our collaborators at Agora, Gitcoin, and Open Source Observer. Thanks for reading and stay optimistic!"

The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 & 5, and will propose round sizes for Retro Funding 6 & 7, to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Below you find some considerations that informed the round sizing:Retro Funding 3 benchmark: In retro round 3, approx 6.5m+ OP were allocated to projects contributing to the OP Stack.Rapid development of the OP Stack: Since round 3, 5+ Protocol upgrades took place that introduced major performance improvements to the OP Stack. Research has accelerated with the deployment of the OP Stack fault proof system on mainnet. Thus, the impact generated by contributions to the OP Stack has increased significantly since October 2023.Voting designRetro Funding 5 will sort Badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications, with the hypothesis that voter experience and allocation of rewards are improved, compared to past rounds. For the round, a number of guest voters with expertise relating to the OP Stack will be selected, to test if there are significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate rewards to OP Stack contributions.

Impact Metrics for Retro Funding 5,"Open Source Observer is happy to support the latest retro round with another suite of impact metrics.As RF5 features OP Stack contributions, the metrics we’ve developed for the round are focused on GitHub repo-level contributions. They are intended to give human voters some helpful “data in the loop” as a complement to projects’ self-reported impact statements.Metrics comes in three flavors:Basic vanilla GitHub stats. We took a snapshot of projects’ GitHub repo stats (stars, forks, etc) at the end of the review process (2024-09-23). Nothing fancy here. You can double-check any of these by clicking on the project’s repo link.Contributor counts. We indexed the event history for each repo to identify unique, non-bot contributors over the lifetime and the past 6 months of the project. We also present a count of “trusted” contributors.Trust weighted metrics. With our friends atOpenRank, we re-ran the “developer rank” and “repo rank” algorithmsused to identify guest votersover a new time interval. The algorithm considers contributions to over 40K repos, seeded by a set of “high impact” repos identified by core devs. These trust-weighted metrics offer a better approximation of the impact a project has had specifically on the Optimism ecosystem versus the broader Ethereum / open source universe.As always, you can see the source code and underlying data behind metricshere, and a copy of the results as a CSV filehere.The MetricsThe following fields are included in the GitHub-based metrics analysis for Retro Funding 5:artifact_url: Repository URL associated with the project based on the application. A project may have multiple repos in its application.project_name: Name of the project.project_category_id: Category ID of the project (1, 2, 3).num_contributors: Total number of contributors before August 1, 2024. A contributor is defined as any non-bot user that has contributed to the repository (since 2015) by committing code directly to a repository, opening an issue, or opening/reviewing a pull request.num_trusted_contributors: Number of trusted contributors before August 1, 2024. A subset of the contributors defined above, this is the number of contributors that are also in the top 420 of theOpenRankdeveloper trust score.num_contributors_last_6_months: Number of contributors over the period February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024.num_stars: Total number of stars as of September 23, 2024.num_trusted_stars: Number of stars from trusted users before August 1, 2024. A subset of the stars defined above, this is the number of stars from users that are also in the top 420 of theOpenRankdeveloper trust score.trust_weighted_stars: This metric is a percentage score between 0% and 100%, representing the sum of the reputation share of the developers who starred the repo. If all developers in OpenRank developer ranking have starred a particular repo, the metric’s value is going to be 100% for this particular repo. The more and the higher ranked developer who starred the repo, the higher the percentage value, the higher impact and quality of this repo. We calculate this metric by first calculating every developer’s reputation share (%) based on their OpenRank score, then sum them up if they starred the target repo.num_forks: Total number of forks as of September 23, 2024.num_trusted_forks: Number of forks from trusted users before August 1, 2024. A subset of the forks defined above, this is the number of forks from users that are also in the top 420 of theOpenRankdeveloper trust score.trust_weighted_forks: This metric is a percentage score between 0% and 100%, representing the sum of the reputation share of the developers who forked the repo. If all developers in OpenRank developer ranking have forked a particular repo, the metric’s value is going to be 100% for this particular repo. The more and the higher ranked developer who forked the target repo, the higher the percentage value, the higher impact and quality of this repo. We calculate this metric by first calculating every developer’s reputation share (%) based on their OpenRank score, then sum them up if they forked the target repo.trust_rank_for_repo_in_category: Ranking of the repository’s OpenRank trust score within its category. A score of 1 indicates the highest ranking repo in its category.age_of_project_years: Age of the project in years, measured from the project’s first public commit to August 1, 2024.application_id: Application ID in the sign-up and voting UIs.CaveatsMetrics are continuously evolving and never a substitute for DYOR as a voter. A few caveats:The metrics come exclusively from public GitHub activity.The majority - but not all - projects in the round submitted GitHub repos as part of their impact statements.Metrics are presented only at the repo level (we don’t roll them up to the project level). Some projects submitted more than one repo and therefore have multiple sets of metrics.The underlying data behind the metrics comes fromgharchive. We only capture contributions to public repos; we don’t capture any private contributions that happened before the repo turned public. This may cause minor differences between the metrics on the project’s voting page and the ones you see on the project’s actual GitHub.Feedback or questions onour GitHub forumare always welcome!"

If you discover a possible conflict later on, you’re required to contact a Lead Reviewer to be removed from reviewing this project. A conflict of Interest is defined as “Organizations where you expect any portion of funds to flow to yourself or any projects from which you derive income”.Reviewer SelectionCitizens will be selected as Reviewers via a combination of an opt-in process and random sampling. This allows for a smaller group to engage in the process, while still being fairly selected via random sampling.Opt-in: Citizens can opt-in to participate in the application review process until Aug 31st 19:00 UTC. To opt-in please fill outthis form(https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups) and be sure you have read theReviewer Expectations.Random Sampling: 30 reviewers will be randomly selected from the citizens who have opted-in to review. Selection will take place on September 2nd and citizens will be notified via email about the outcome of the random selection.Lead Reviewers: Diego, the Citizens’ House Gov NERD, will act as a non-voting lead reviewer, responsible for resolving questions, collecting votes, managing the timeline of the process and facilitating collaboration. One additional non-voting lead reviewer will be selected by Diego to manage and facilitate the process during European working hours. You can add your application to be a lead reviewer in the sign up form.Reviewer Groups:Instead of randomly assigning reviewers to cases, there will be 6 reviewer groups with 5 reviewers each. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to a group. This design aims at reducing the operational and technical complexity, as well as allow for more collaboration among reviewers.Application Review Process Overviewimage2000×848 106 KBApplication is submittedviaretrofunding.optimism.ioApplication is assigned to reviewer group(see “Reviewer Selection”)Rule Violation Check: 2 reviewers, from the relevant reviewer group, review the application for rule violations. If both reviewers approve the application, it qualifies for the round.Full Review: If at least 1 reviewer rejected the application, the remaining 3 reviewers in the reviewer group are asked to submit their review. If the majority of reviewers approve, the application qualifies for the round.Appeal: If a majority of reviewers rejected the application, the applicant can hand in an appeal. The appeal will then be reviewed by 5 reviewers from a different reviewer group to the one that did the initial review. The reviewer group decides if the application is rejected/approved by majority vote.Application Edits: Edits to a projects application are only allowed in cases where the application form itself is misguided or deceived applications, bugs caused input errors or the application category was selected wrong. The Foundation decides which applications are allowed to be edited. Relevant edits are made following the Full Review and are considered within the Appeals process.Application rulesBelow are rules for which violation will result in the removal of an application from a Retro Funding round.False statements & deception- false claims about your contributions, past impact or funding & grants are not allowed.Hateful Content- No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination as defined by therules of engagementDeceiving badgeholders- Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users.Fraud & Impersonation- Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project; the funds must go to the project.Advertising- Using Retro Funding application to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT dropOutside of Retro round scope or not meeting eligibility criteria- Contributions that do not have a clear relationship to the scope of the retro round, or do not meet eligibility criteriaSpam- Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links.

Pairwise: Community Signaling in Retro Funding 4 - No badge required 😉,"Pairwise is making voting to distribute RetroPGF simple and fun. We are now pivoting to make signaling RetroPGF accessible to everyone in the Optimism Community! Pairwise is an open-source, off-chain voting dapp (like Snapshot) that streamlines community signaling by letting users select between just two options and then aggregating their choices into a quantifiable result. Pairwise is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Pairwise converts simple subjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs, minimizing the cost and cognitive burden of voting.422×861 182 KBPairwise real potential lies in aggregating data from various voters, allowing them to concentrate on areas where they have expertise. This means voters will spend more time in their areas of expertise.This has incredible potential to increase project discovery and network effects within our community. This is why with this new version, we aim to give more community stakeholder groups the opportunity to participate in RetroPGF. We will amplify the voices of token holders, delegates, RetroPGF recipients, and badgeholders as community signaling.Community Signaling as a Metric in Retro Funding 4Retro Funding 4 is all about Metrics and one of the challenges on a heavy metrics result is that metrics can be manipulated and reductionist. Goodhart’s Law states: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.Dive deeper on this inthis postfrom Owocki.Furthermore, impact is more than TVL and number of unique transactions. Not every $100 transaction has the same impact. The impact of a project facilitating remittances would be considered by most to be more valuable than a meme coin, even if the onchain data says otherwise.PairwiseRetro Funding 4We are eager to put qualitative data onchain and give badgeholders the option to factor in community signaling as an onchain metric for Retro Funding 4 and we have a beautiful new version of our app to do it with!With Pairwise, the community can engage, discover, review, and rank the types of projects that interest them in Retro Funding 4. We will break the applicants into several categories which will contain 15-30 projects and the community will be able to rank the projects within each category, and then rank these categories as well. In this way, each voter can analyze just a portion of the projects and we can aggregate the results into one final ranking.Pairwise WIP demoMajor V2 improvements:Mobile firstVoter feedbackTinder-style filteringSound effects & background musicPseudonymous account abstractionAlso the community will not allocate a number of tokens to each project, instead they only rank the projects using filtering and pairwise assessment. This greatly reduces the cognitive load of voting and gamifies the user experience.The challenges to overcome are the tight timeline and engagement. We will launch a marketing campaign to maximize participation with rewards included from our RetroPGF 3 rewards!Our proposal is to create four metrics, one for each of four stakeholder group; Badgeholders Rank, OP Hodlers Rank, Builders Rank & Delegates Rank. However we also could create 1 metric and give each stakeholder group 25% of the influence of an aggregated result if adding 4 metrics to the voting UI is seen as too much.

Everyone except delegates can also be accounted for as an OP holder. The reason for this is to protect user anonymity; otherwise, we could risk potential counter-engineering of anonymity.Every one of those stakeholders will have a Pairwise ranking and those rankings will be aggregated. In order for for a bucket to provide relevant information to the collective we need:Badgeholders: 30 participating and at least 5 finalizing each categoryRecipients: 100 participating and 10 finalizing each categoryDelegates: 100 participating in Pairwise and 10 finalizing each categoryHolders: 400 participating and 20 finalizing each categoryIf one of the groups doesn’t meet the criteria, it will not be qualified to be a metric for voting in Retro Funding 4. At least 1 group needs to meet the minimum engagement requirements or no data will be added to the round.TimingThe app will be ready for community signaling as soon as possible after projects are finalized. We propose to begin the signaling before the official vote begins and end a week before the voting has ended so that the final results are solidified for the last week of badgeholder voting.Ranking MathTo determine the final rankings, we are debating three potential distributions that will be shared shortly in the comments below. Our goal is to gather feedback from the community on which distribution model will give the ideal distribution.Reward Distribution for Pairwise VotingThe reward system is designed to promote stakeholder engagement. Pairwise is as fun as voting gets and we want to spice it up rewarding stakeholders signaling their preferences to the collective. We are allocating a total of 4,000 OP from our RetroPGF 3 Rewards, with 1,000 OP designated for each stakeholder group (Badgeholders, Recipients, Delegates, and Holders). Each participant’s chance of winning increases with more categories they vote in.Raffle Tickets:For every 10 points earned, participants receive one raffle ticket.More tickets mean higher chances of winning.How to Get Points::Category Participation: Finalizing the first category gives 10 points.Weighted Bonus Points (For Delegates and Hodlers bucket):Whale: +20 points per categoryDiamond: +15 points per categoryPlatinum: +10 points per categoryGold: +5 points per categorySilver: +3 points per categoryBronze: No additional pointsMax Tickets: 25% of the total number of categories. Once you have ranked 25% of the categories, you do not get extra points for ranking more.Note that each stakeholder group has an equal total of 1,000 OP for distribution. A Holder may accumulate more points than a Badgeholder, but this will not affect the distribution among Badgeholders—it only enhances their chances within the Holder category.At the end of the voting period, 10 winners will be randomly selected from the raffle tickets in each group. This ensures every participant has a chance to win, with active members enjoying improved odds thanks to their contributions to the collective. If a participant is both a Badgeholder and a Delegate, 1 vote will put them in both raffles!Anti-Gaming Measures and TransparencyThe Pairwise voting process is not like snapshot, it will be very easy to track how users use the application using traditional analytics tooling to separate authentic users from bots and people who are just clicking through to promote their own projects.If the ballot submission looks like they are only farming the reward or just voting for their own projects without putting in an authentic effort to judge other projects, we will not give rewards to that voter, but we will still count the ballot. For the first round we will count every ballot even if we believe someone is farming the system for rewards.We will maintain complete transparency in the reward calculation and distribution process. Everything will be public.Join us in Shaping the Future of PairwiseWe would love to hear your feedback and shape this experiment collectively. We’ve received massive support from the collective and want to continue evolving to suit the needs of the community to the best of our capacity. We’ve been working onthis prototypethat will internally launch on May 15.You can share your comments here, or DM me at@Zeptimusqon Telegram, where we can go more in-depth and schedule a demo call."

After unlocking, you’ll be redirected back to the Main UI to finalize your vote1600×980 208 KBNew Feature: Star RatingsThis round, we’re introducing a new feature to enhance your experience and reduce the number of comparisons needed for accurate results: star ratings. Using stars is optional but heavily encouraged.Stars will group projects into five categories:→ Projects with very high impact on the OP stack→ Projects with high impact on the OP stack→ Projects with medium impact on the OP stack→ Projects with low impact on the OP stack→ Projects with no impact on the OP stackStar ratings will have the ultimate influence on the final score while the pairwise comparisons will sort the projects within the star ratings. Assigning 5 stars to a project places it at the top of your list, while assigning a project 1 star eliminates it from further comparisons and will give it 0 OP on the ballot. Initially, all projects start with a default rating of 3 stars. You can adjust these ratings during the comparison process, with the exception of 1-star projects, which will not reappear before finalizing your vote on the main voting dapp.Once you finish the ranking process you will see this screen to unlock your ballot. After unlocking your ballot you will be sent back to the Main UI to add the last magic touch to your results before casting your vote.Thank you for playing!Your participation in Retro Funding 5 is what makes this process impactful.

We imagine a future in which Optimism core development, governance contributions, developer tooling, onchain applications, and more, are sustainably rewarded for the impact they provide to the Optimism Collective.Retro Funding 5 rewards contributors to theOP Stack, including core Ethereum infrastructure that supports or underpins the OP Stack, advancements in OP Stack research and development, and tooling which supports its accessibility and usability. Impact generated between October 2023 - August 2024 will be rewarded. You can find the full details of the round’s design and its componentshere.VotingYou can find the voting apphereThe thesis behind this Retro Funding voting design is that sorting voters into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications will lead to an improved voter experience and allocation of rewards, compared to past rounds.Voting on BudgetAs a voter in Retro Funding 5, you are tasked with deciding the overall token allocation for the round, as well as determining how rewards should be allocated across the three scope categories.Round allocation: You will vote on the total amount of OP to be allocated for the round, within the Foundation’s set range of 2M to 8M OP. Choose an amount that you believefairly reflects the impact of the projects in this round. The final round allocation will be determined by taking the median of all votes.Category allocation: You will also vote on the percentage of OP that should be allocated to each of the three categories. This allocation should represent the impact of projects within each category. The final category allocation will be determined by taking the median of all votes and normalizing results.You can change your votes at any point before submitting your ballot. Your votes on round allocation and category allocation will be public.Voting on ProjectsYou have been randomly assigned to evaluate projects within one of the three categories. You can check the category you’ve been assigned on theballot page.Rate projects: To unlock your ballot, you must first rate each project on a scale from low impact to high impact.Declare Conflicts of Interests: If you have a Conflict of Interest with any project, you are required to declare it. You will then be excluded from voting on that specific project. A Conflict of Interest is defined as an organization where you expect any portion of funds to flow to yourself or any projects from which you derive income. More information can be found in theSelf-dealing policy.Rank Projects: After rating, you’ll see a preliminary ranking of projects based on their impact. You can adjust this ranking to ensure it accurately reflects your preferences.Allocate rewards:You can then allocate a percentage of rewards to each project, either by selecting one of the suggested allocation methods or by creating a custom allocation. Note that your reward allocation will remain private.You can find a walkthrough of voting functionalityhereThe final project allocation will be determined by taking the median to all votes and normalizing results.Useful ToolsPairwise: Pairwise is a fun voting option to gamify and simplify the decision making process, allowing Badgeholders to create their ballot by comparing projects.Impact Garden: Impact Garden is a protocol designed to generate reputation based onchain impact data to improve funding allocation for public goods.DeVouch: Signal your support for legitimate projects applying for Retro Funding rounds or flag suspicious ones using on-chain attestations.RF5 Voting simulator: Spreadsheet to support you in deciding on round and category allocationRetrolist.app&Retropgfhub.com: Browse all projects which applied to the roundImpact = ProfitRetro Funding’s purpose is to reward projects for the impact they have created for the Optimism Collective. Following the axiom of “impact = profit”, the Collective believes in fairly rewarding each contributor for the impact they have provided. In no way does Retro Funding reward expected future work or impact of projects, it’s only concerned with retroactively rewarding the impact that has already been created.Within this round, you will find information on the Optimism grants projects have received since January 2023 and investment, defined as “funding provided by individuals or investment firms in exchange for equity ownership”, since Jan 2020. In addition, there’s information on the pricing model of a project to gain insights into their business model. The Foundation believes that venture funding should not be a factor when evaluating a project’s impact. In fact, theoriginal vision of Retroactive Public Goods Fundingencourages the development of a venture capital market specifically for public goods. You can read more about this topichere.Voter Selection ExperimentIn Round 5, we tested aselection mechanismthat used GitHub contribution graphs to attempt to identify individuals with a high ‘proximity’ to the OP Stack. We wanted to understand if this selection method is effective at identifying individuals with OP Stack competency, and whether this leads to a difference in voting outcomes.Part of the experiment analysis will look at the voting patterns across groups with high proximity to the OP Stack and those with lower proximity to the OP Stack. As such, its important that youdon’t talk to other voters outside of the Telegram groups you were added to. This especially applies to Guest Voters - since Guest Voters were selected to have high OP Stack proximity, its important that Guest Voters don’t influence the votes of Citizens with less understanding of the OP Stack.Self-dealing & Bribery policyVoters shouldnot vote for organizations where they expect any portion of funds to flow to them or any projects from which they derive income.Voters will need to disclose their conflict of interest during their review of projects in the voting process. For each project they review, badgeholders will see the option to disclose a Conflict of Interest. Projects for which a badgeholder has disclosed a Conflict of Interest will be removed from the badgeholders ballot. Any voter can vote on the Round allocation and category allocation, independent of conflicts of interests relating to individual projects. Conflict of Interest disclosures will be public. See theRetro Funding: Self-Dealing Policyfor more details.Voters shouldrefrain from engaging in bribery.

Retro Funding 5: Announcing Guest Voter Participation,"Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 5 will reward contributions to the OP Stack. As part of Retro Funding 5 a new kind of experiment will be run that aims to increase our collective knowledge around Citizenship selection mechanisms.In Retro Funding 5, a random sample of ~90 existing Citizens will be asked to participate in voting. Randomly sampling participants is a way to keep the Citizen workload manageable despite an increased number of rounds, and is a well established method of forming a representative sample of a larger population. In addition to these Citizens, ~30 Guest voters will participate in voting.Guest votersGuest voters are temporary participants able to vote in a single Retro Round. This new concept allows the Collective toexperiment with different selection mechanisms without making any permanent changes to Citizenship.How to become a guest voter for Retro Funding 5Applications to become a guest voter are open untilupdated: new deadline is July 31st!to developers contributing to the Optimism ecosystem. Of all applicants, ~30 will be selected to participate as guest voters using a ‘Proof of Work’ selection mechanism (see below). Part of this mechanism will involve an analysis of public GitHub account activity before June 27th 2024. The algorithm will be shared publicly after the selection process has taken place to avoid influencing the experiment.If you are a developer and you want to participate in voting for Retro Funding 5, please create your Optimist Profile and submit an applicationhereby July 31th 2024. Any developer can apply, the algorithm will rank and select the top applicants based on their code contributions to relevant repositories. Therefore, please apply even if you are unsure whether your contributions are significant. Please do not apply if you are not a developer.Proof of WorkThe hypothesis behind Proof of Work is that individuals who have contributed work and impact to the Collective will demonstrate relevant competencies and understanding of the Optimism ecosystem. Voting in Retro Funding 5 will benefit from a technical understanding of the OP Stack, which is why this particular opportunity was taken to test a selection mechanism aimed at identifying voters with relevant technical competencies.In the context of this experiment, the Proof of Work selection mechanism is being tested across only a single dimension - code contributions. However, the concept of Proof of Work can be applied to other areas and is not limited to technical contributions.What does this mean for future Citizen selection?The development of Citizenship is reliant on knowledge gathered from experimentation - this is the first in a series of Citizenship selection experiments designed with this end in mind. To read more about experimentation with Citizen selection, seethis gov docs post.Learnings from this series of experiments will help the Collective gather knowledge about a variety of selection methods which is an important step in empowering Citizens to make informed choices about Citizenship criteria in the future.This experiment should not be taken to imply that future Citizen selection will focus on developers or the Proof of Work mechanism. Future Retro Funding Rounds may experiment with other methods of Citizen selection targeted at different Optimism participants."
Retro Funding 5: Expert voting experiment,"Retroactive Public Goods Funding 5(Retro Funding) will reward contributions to the OP Stack. A high degree of knowledge is required to understand the OP Stack’s different components, the impact of protocol development initiatives and the usefulness of tools that support OP chain operators. The hypothesis that round 5 is aiming to test is if experts make better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions compared to non-experts.Research QuestionsThe Retro Funding 5 governance experiment is designed around the following research questions:Are there significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate resources to technical contributions?Are there significant differences between existing badgeholders and new guest voters, both in how they vote to allocate resources and in other characteristics?Will sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications improve the voter experience?Expertise MeasurementExpertise is measured via a score assigned to each individual based on their past Github activity relating to the OP Stack. The GitHub accounts of guest voters are collected in theapplication flow to become a guest voter. Badgeholders are invited to add their GitHub account to theirOptimist Profilein the process of completing Season 6 onboarding. The scores are assigned using an algorithm developed through a collaboration betweenKarma3LabsandOpen Source Observer, and is based onHubs and Authorities. The algorithm is more complex thanEigenTrust, because it incorporates two entities: GitHub Repos and GitHub Users, both of which can have ‘trust’ and give ‘trust’ to each other. You can find more details on guest voter selectionhereand the algorithmhere.Voter groupsIn order to account for a small degree of churn, the following voter groups have been formed and participants informed by email:Badgeholders: 97 individualsGuest Voters: 30 individualsGuest VotersGuest voters were separately announced inthis forum post.Guest voters were selected by choosing the top ranked applicants based on OP Stack expertise. The algorithm ranked all GitHub users on their proximity to the OP Stack.The highest rank among the Guest Voters is#3out of ~74,000 GitHub users with a score of 2.47 (zero is a perfect score)The median rank was#111The lowest rank among the Guest Voters is#861with a score of 5.7430 Guest voters were invited to account for the possibility of churn.CitizensGiven that the number of Citizens that opted-in to participate in Season 6 was 97 (as of August 16th), all Citizens who opted-in before 16.08.24 have been invited to participate in the Round, with 34 assigned to the experiment condition (high OP Stack expertise) and 63 to the control condition (low OP Stack expertise).The expertise ranking of Citizens ranges from none (no GitHub or no relevant GitHub activity) to the highest ranking expertise score -#58with a score of 4.17The median expertise score was 6.95Citizens above the median expertise score were assigned to the experiment condition and the other half was assigned to the control condition.Random samplingRandom sampling is a widely used statistical method in which all members of a population (all Citizens) have the same probability of being selected. Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection. Read more hereExperimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' HouseTreatment and control groupsRetroactive Public Goods Funding is an ongoing experiment, in which the Collective tests and validates different voting designs based on how well they perform at rewarding impact. Previous experiments were largely product iterations based on learnings from previous rounds and hypothesised improvements. For future rounds, experimentation will become more scientific to better understand cause and effect of different design choices. We believe this approach will allow the Collective to develop an industry-leading approach to metagovernance that will strengthen the design of the system over time.  Retro Funding 5 introduces the concept of treatment and control groups. In experimental design, the “treatment group” participates in the experiment, while the “control group” does not (representing the status quo.) This allows hypotheses to be validated or invalidated by comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group. Specifically, taking this approach in Round 5 will allow the Collective to generate actionable insights about the performance of expert voters compared to non-expert voters.Voting ProcessAn iteration on Retro Funding voting design is the allocation of voters into subgroups. Each subgroup only votes on a specific category of projects (e.g. Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research & Development, OP Stack Tooling). This has been a popular experimentation request and is one proposed methodology by which the Retro Funding voting process can be scaled to reward more projects. This change can be understood as a product iteration, as its validation largely relies on the change in performance data compared to previous rounds and badgeholder feedback, while there is no control group which would allow for more scientific comparison.Process Overview:Subgroups are established: voters are (randomly) assigned into subgroups, the subgroups are equal in size and remain representative of the different voter groups.Category allocation: All voters vote on the allocation of OP among the three categories of the round scope. These votes will be public.Impact Evaluation: Each voter votes on the amount of retro rewards all projects within their assigned category should receive. Votes will be private to prevent intimidation and coercion, promote unbiased decision-making and protect against bribery.Voting designThe Foundation Mission “Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding” is expected to deliver relevant insights into voting design tradeoffs, which will inform the selection of a voting mechanism for round 5. Further details on the implementation of impact = profit within the round, and the policy for conflicts of interests among badgeholders, will follow."

Upcoming Retro rounds and their design,"Based on Round 3 learnings, Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) is transitioning from broad scoped rounds to more narrowly scoped rounds; you can find out more about this transitionhere.To provide more transparency into the Retro Funding design process, in line withOptimism’s path towards Open Metagovernance, we’re sharing plans and considerations for Retro rounds for all of 2024. You can find the announcement of upcoming roundshere.Scoping & Sizing retro roundsScoping retro roundsThe scope of a retro roundoutlines the type of impact that is being rewarded.Feedback from Retro Funding 3suggests that narrowly scoped rounds can lead to significant improvements of the builder and voter experience. In scoping retro rounds in 2024, the Foundation aimed to identify the types of contributions which are most impactful to the Collective and where Retro Funding is best suited to support. The detailed scope of each retro round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.Sizing retro roundsThe aim for sizing round rewards is to provide OP rewards which accurately reflect the impact within the scope of a retro round and provide a strong incentive for contributing to the Collective. The amount of rewards for each round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 & 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 & 7 to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, the goal for this process will be to gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.Citizen workloadWhile the number of retro rounds is increasing, the goal is for individual citizen workload to not increase and possibly be reduced. In previous retro rounds, citizens’ provided feedback on the time intensive labor of participating and shared concerns that increasing the number of rounds will increase the required time commitment of individual citizens. Retro Funding is actively exploring designs & experiments which enable an increase in the number of rounds while not impacting individual citizens workload.More rounds, more experimentsRunning multiple types of rounds allows us to run different experiments on the best ways to scale and improve Retro Funding. Below you find an overview of the experiments planned for 2024.Measuring impactOne of the obstacles citizens faced in Retro Funding 3was the challenge of evaluating different types of impact using the same approach. Not all impact is the same, and different types of impact are best measured via different approaches. Below you find a summary of the framework which the Foundation applies to explore appropriate approaches to measuring different types of impact.Contributions to Optimism can be categorized as either upstream or downstream of Optimism blockspace.Upstream contributions improve Optimism itself, this includes improvements to the OP Stack and Optimism GovernanceDownstream contributions improve the experience of Optimism users, such as builders and consumers.Untitled5085×776 167 KBUpstream impact is measured via the aggregate utility of Optimism usersTo evaluate impact which is upstream, we need to understand how the contribution has increased the aggregate utility of all users of the Optimism Platform. With the goal of understanding how a particular contribution has increased the aggregate usefulness of the Optimism Platform. Measuring this utility, and proving causality, poses a significant challenge.Example: how do you measure the impact of a particular protocol update of the OP stack?Downstream impact is measured via the utility derived by individual Optimism usersTo evaluate impact which is downstream, we can gather and analyse signals from individual users which express the utility derived from a contribution. E.g., how has the contribution benefited builders and consumers?Gathering and analysing these signals presents significant challenges, such as sybil resistance and vanity metrics.Example: seedownstream impact, a metric in which dev libraries are evaluated based on the output of the builders on Optimism which use themUpcoming Retro Funding experiments are designed to best address the different nature of upstream and downstream impact:Experiment 1: Impact JuriesThesis#1:By sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications, impact measurement is improved.Thesis#2: Sortition, the selection of public jurors by using a random representative sample, allows us to effectively scale citizenshipIn Retro Funding 3, citizensrequested a more focused evaluation experience. Sorting citizens and projects into groups has been a popular suggested solution. Impact Juries will be used to reward upstream impact, as this category can benefit from a qualitative approach to measuring impact.Experiment 2:Metrics-based EvaluationThesis#3: By leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual projects.In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders voiced that non-standardized impact metrics added difficulty to the voting process and expressed desire to directly vote based on metrics. Examples of this approach include Buidl Guidl’simpact calculatorand OpenSource Observersimpact vectors. Metrics-based evaluation will be used to reward downstream impact, as this category can benefit from a quantitive approach to measuring impact.Upcoming Retro RoundsUntitled 11501×800 75.1 KBRetro Funding 4: Onchain BuildersUntitled 2900×400 165 KBScope: Reward onchain builders for driving the adoption of OptimismTimeline: May 2024Impact category: downstreamExperiment: Metrics-based evaluationThe Collective is focused on growing the number ofactive onchain builders. Onchain builders introduce new users to Optimism, drive protocol usage and network effects. In the Superchain vision, onboarding a new user to an OP chain benefits the Collective as a whole. By rewarding these contributions, Retro Funding can further differentiate Optimism’s offering for developers in the highly competitive market of EVM blockspace. This scope is closely aligned withCollective Intent 2 “Grow the Superchain”.Retro Funding 5: OP StackUntitled 3900×400 171 KBScope: Reward contributions to the OP stackTimeline: Aug 2024Impact category: upstreamExperiment: Impact JuriesThe Optimism Collective must continue to make progress on its core value proposition to provide resilient, decentralized, scalable compute.

Rewarding contributions to Optimism Governance is closely aligned withCollective Intent 2 “Grow the Superchain”Please note that timelines are subject to possible changes and adjustment.Outside of retro round scopeContributions which fall outside of the scope of upcoming retro rounds include consumer facing tools, education initiatives and events. The Collective can still support these contributions viaToken House Missions.Whats next?For each retro round more details on scope, timeline and governance design will follow. As, always, these considerations will be shared with the community for feedback as well as with theFeedback Commission."

Retro Funding 5: Application Form Changes,"This post outlines the changes and updates which are being made toOP Atlasin preparation forRetro Funding 5.The infrastructure for the application process is created and hosted by Agora, you can find the relevant codehere.TimelineSign up: Aug 22nd - Sept 5thApplication Review Process: Sept 6th - Sept 20thVoting: September 21st - Oct 4thResults & Grant delivery: October 10thOrganizationsIn previous Retro Funding rounds, we’ve seen that individual applications are often overloaded with many different types of projects. For example, inRetro Funding 3…Test-in-Prodapplied with 5 distinct projects, ranging from work on OP Stack client implementations to data analytics work.Department of Decentralizationapplied both with their work on conferences and hackathons, such as ETHBerlin and Protocol Berg, as well their work on the Goerli Testnetwork.This mixture of substantially different projects in a single application adds difficulty to the voting process. It makes comparisons among applications harder and increases the complexity of voting.Organizations aim to solve this problem.An organization is a new entity within OP Atlas that reflects a company, DAO or team which is working together. Each organization can create one or multiple projects that reflect distinct products, services, or contributions.Organization: Team, DAO, or business working together on one or multiple projectsProject:A distinct product, service, or contribution that reflects a significant amount of workWhat should not be a project:Individual activities within a larger project, such as a commit, a contract deployment on a new chain, a single call or presentation.With Organizations, Test-in-Prod can represent itself as a team, and then create distinct projects with which they want to apply to Retro Funding. Each project will then be judged separately within the relevant retro round.While in some cases creating an organization is helpful, projects do not need to be associated to an organization. For example, individuals building things by themselves can simply create a project and submit it for Retro Funding consideration. Groups of people who worked together on a single project, for example as part of a hackathon, may also choose not to create an organization. Creating the right framework for organizations and projects remains a challenge that we’ll continue to iterate on, and we appreciate your feedback.Application QuestionsAs a continuation of the involvement of badgeholders in the design process of Retro Funding rounds, the Foundationhosted a workshopwith the aim of refining the project application form to collect more insightful information for the Retro Funding 5 voting process. The workshop provided valuable insights into the kinds of questions and answers that will help badgeholders better evaluate projects impact across thethree scope categories.Workshop Outcomes:Refined Questions for Impact Evaluation:Through group discussions, we identified key questions that should be included in the project application form to help badgeholders assess impact more effectively. For instance, we determined that for Ethereum Core Contributions, it’s crucial to ask questions that clarify how a project supports or is a dependency of the OP Stack. Important feedback has been the desire to have more verifiable information about projects impact, instead of self-reported statements,  user testimonials were  highlighted as anexample of this.Targeted Asks:The workshop also shed light on the nature of the data submitted for the different categories through an exercise of evaluating the answers received in Retro Funding 3. A more focused set of questions, anchored in tangible, specific impact related proof were brought forward to avoid broad, or at times unrelated, information being submitted by projects.We collated the most effective questions that emerged from each group discussion per category and sent out a survey to the broader badgeholder set to gather additional feedback and enable broader voting and calibration of these questions. The aim of the workshop & survey is to make the application process better aligned with the needs and expectations of badgeholders, ultimately leading to more accurate rewarding of impact in Retro Funding 5.Below are the final application questions which were selected as a result of the workstream:Ethereum Core Contributions: How does your project support, or is a dependency of, the OP Stack? How would it impact the OP Stack if your project ceased to exist?OP Stack Research & Development: How has your project advanced the development of the OP Stack? Who has benefited the most from your work on the OP Stack and how?OP Stack Tooling: How has the infrastructure you built enabled the testing, deployment, and operation of OP chains? Who has used your tooling and how has it benefited them (Please reference relevant data sources which surface the impact of your tooling, such as user surveys, testimonials, attestations etc)?Other Updates & ChangesProject grant and funding reporting: SeeRetro Funding 5: Grants & Funding within the application processpost for more details.Add Links:  Applicants can now add links to their projects. They can add any link which supports them in showcasing their impact. They may also provide a name and description for each link.Improved project creation to application handover: The final step in creating a project in our system is to publish that project’s metadata onchain. Some projects completed this step, but then failed to also submit an application. Messaging has been added to make it clear that after publishing a project, applicantsmust also submit an applicationto participate in a retro round.Round details and application:We’ve made the round details (found in the round application) visible to anyone before signing in.Markdown support:In the round application, free form input fields will support markdown."
Retro Funding 5: Grants & Funding within the application process,"This post outlines which sources of grants and funding projects need to report when applying to Retro Funding 5.ChallengesThedeliberative process on profit in Retro Funding 4highlighted the many challenges in collecting information about grants and funding received by projects:Verifiability: The amount of grants (other than Optimism grants), funding and revenue a project has received is usually non-public information, making it impossible to verify the accurate reporting by projects. This dynamic creates an incentive for projects to not disclose grants, funding and revenue.Attributing Optimism Grants: Optimism issues a number of different types of grants (Token House missions, Foundation missions, and Partner Fund grants). A grant might be received for a variety of purposes with distinct grant conditions. Participants in the deliberative process have highlighted the complexity when considering these many different grant types, a prime example has been the distinction between Token House Builder grants and Growth grants.Attributing Profit to Impact:A project might receive grants and funding for different services or products benefitting different types of users, companies and ecosystems. To implement impact = profit, Retro Funding needs to attribute what forms of grants and funding relate to the impact that is rewarded in the relevant retro round. This attribution poses a complex challenge, as it requires an understanding of the purpose of different grants and funding that were received.Attribution of Funding and Revenue:The structuring of legal entities can have a significant effect on how revenue, grants and funding are attributed to projects. Some companies may pursue a structure where the development of different products (closed and open source) takes place within separate legal entities, while others combine open and closed source work within a single entity. Projects which combine open and closed source work within a single entity might be worse off, as all their funding and revenue is considered, while projects with separate entities benefit.Retro Funding 5: Information CollectionFor Retro Funding 5, the application process will provide badgeholders with relevant information relating to grants and funding, based on feedback from thedeliberative process experimentandprevious retro rounds. In Round 5, the voter exit survey will aim to measure the importance of this information to voters, to understand the value this information provides in the voting process to inform future application processes.The following information will be collected from projectsPricing:Projects are required to report if their product/service is free, freemium or pay-to-use. If one of latter two categories is selected, the project is asked to report the pricing model for their product/service. This information is aiming to give voters insights into the business model of a project and its value extraction. The application review process will rely on publicly available information to enforce the accurate reporting of this information. The correct reporting of non-public information can’t be enforced.Optimism Grants:Due to the verifiability of Optimism grants, projects are required to report grants which they received from the Token House, Citizens’ House or Optimism Foundation since January 2023. This includes Token House Missions, Foundation Missions and Retro Funding rewards.Investments: Projects are required to report funding which they received in exchange for equity since January 2020. They reporting is done by selecting between ranges of funding (Less than $1M, $1M-$5M, $5M-$10M, $10M-$25M, $25M-$50M, more than $50M). The application review process will rely on publicly available information to verify the accurate reporting of this information. The correct reporting of non-public information can’t be verified, this poses a significant risk of including funding in the definition of profit.The following information will not be collected from projects:Other Grants: Information on non-Optimism grants will not be collected due to its non-verifiable nature combined with the results ofthe deliberative process on profit, in which 74% of participants voted to not consider “Other Grants” in Retro Funding.Revenue → Replaced by Pricing: Information on non-Optimism grants will not be collected due to its non-verifiable nature combined with the results ofthe deliberative process on profit, in which 80% of participants voted to not consider “Revenue” in Retro Funding. Instead the application process is collecting information on pricing to provide insights into the value extraction of a project (see above).Risks and DrawbacksBadgeholders should be aware of the risks and drawbacks introduced by the current state of defining impact = profit. A key goal of Retro Funding is to sustainably reward Optimism core contributors for the impact they provide to the Collective. Key to achieving this goal is creating reliability for projects when it comes to Retro Funding rewards, so that they can contribute to Optimism knowing that they will be rewarded for their impact.The current state of defining profit,poses a significant challenge to achieving reliability.It creates high uncertainty for projects, as they are not able to understand how grants and funding may impact their Retro Funding rewards.Further, the current design leads to inconsistency on how grants and funding are taken into account within impact evaluation. Each badgeholder may apply a different definition of profit across projects. This results in a system in which the grants and funding of two identical projects may have vastly different effects on their Retro Funding rewards.In the spirit of Governance minimisation,Retro Funding should strive to use a minimal set of rules required to reward impact.This is a core principal of Optimism Governance because each additional rule adds high costs to the system by requiring more bureaucracy to support its enforcement, increasing the surface area for attack and overall complexity and rigidity of the system.We appreciate the many discussions badgeholders have had on the topic of profit over the past four rounds. We’ve used insights and outputs from the deliberative process to make incremental progress towards this definition in Round 5. It will continue to be an iterative and gradual process to define the goals and implementation of profit as it pertains to impact evaluation."
Advanced metrics for Retro Funding,"We just published anew blogpostcalled:  “WAR for public goods, or why we need more advanced metrics in crypto”.tl;dr -WinsAboveReplacement is anadvanced baseball statthat measures a player’s contribution to their team by comparing them to a hypothetical replacement-level player. The post explores how an empirically-derived metric similar to WAR might be applied to ecosystem grants programs as a way of measuring ROI. It includes some use case ideas (like a WAR oracle) and strawman WAR formulas for protocols and open source software (OSS) projects.WAR is not just a fun meme, but also a preview of the form factor that the next generation of impact metric could take.ContextIt’s been a little over a year since ourhello world poston the forum andMirror essayon how data can improve future iterations of RetroPGF (now Retro Funding).Like most worthy problems, the deeper you go, the more complexity you uncover, but also the more obsessed you get with the problem space. We are not turning back the ship but we are staring at a pretty big ocean of possibilities!We’ve tried to document both our learnings and our thought process along the way viaour blog. OurGitHubis also a pretty good place to see how things have evolved.But, broadly speaking, this has been the progression:a year ago there were effectively no metrics, just project profileswe did a lot of analysis with relatively little data on RF3, creating “impact vectors” and “lists” based on fairly gameable metrics like stars, downloads, transaction counts, etc.we worked with badgeholders on thefirst set of metrics in RF4and the first metrics-based voting round (and have more in store for RF5-7)we’ve done some initiallongitudinal analysiscomparing RF-funded projects against other cohortsHere’s the evolution…image1226×778 82.4 KBRight now, we are currently focused on thelongitudinal metricsstage, but can start to see the next evolutionary breakthrough:advanced metricsAdvanced metricsWe are continually ingesting new public datasets and building more metric models, but at the same time, we are also expanding OSO’s coverage to more projects and chains. This opens up the possibility of deriving new metrics that look more holistically at a project’s contributionsrelative to some baseline.In baseball, there is a famous advanced metric called “WAR” which allows for player comparisons across teams, leagues, years, and eras. There isn’t a single, standard formula for WAR. Different sources use various calculations, but they all rely on the same public datasets, publish their methodologies, and follow similar principles. Some key points:WAR includes a mix of offensive and defensive metrics, making it a more holistic measure than ones that focus on a single aspect.It adjusts for different player positions, recognizing that not all positions are equally important defensively.The averages and constants are derived empirically by looking at performance over a specific period, such as a single season or multiple seasons (an “era”).In the context of a grant program like Retro Funding, we want to understand how effective each round is relative to all the other incentive programs happening (or not happening) in the space AND have some way of aggregating the quality of all the proects being supported.WAR could help identify not only successful projects but also weak points within an ecosystem — whether in developer tooling, user engagement, or protocol innovation — that need more investment. It could be used to determine eligibility for grant rounds or power oracles that allocate ongoing funding streams to high-performing projects.The post includes a few strawman proposals for what a WAR for OSS projects or WAR for protocols might look like. The challenge lies in identifying metrics that not only capture current activity but also predict future growth and network effects. Realistically, it’s going to take some time to have decent WAR models running in production.Some next stepsThe post also include some ideas for how to get started…Start Simple: The first version of WAR was fairly basic. Over time, more sophisticated versions emerged. Similarly, the initial metrics for decentralized ecosystems don’t need to be perfect. Starting with something simple allows for gradual refinement and improvement (see:Gall’s Law).Embrace Competing Implementations: As mentioned earlier, there is no single standard calculation for WAR. Even though the data and methodologies are public, there’s vibrant debate about which method is best. In an industry as dynamic as crypto, this diversity of approaches is a strength, encouraging innovation and continuous improvement.Engage the Research Community: WAR models are like catnip for data enthusiasts. They offer endless opportunities for simulation, experimentation, and visualization. By providing well-documented, easy-to-use datasets and stoking interest in the results from protocol leaders and governance teams, we can create a garden of catnip for researchers and data nerds.Check out thefull postand let us know if you have ideas for a WAR model or anything else metrics-related!"

Retro Funding 5 Guest Voter Selection Algorithm Explanation,"In this experiment, we wanted to rank developers, identified by their GitHub accounts, based on their proximity to OP Stack repos. We trialed a unique approach with a custom implementation of the EigenTrust algorithm.Special thanks to Carl Cervone (Open Source Observer), Emily Furlong (Optimism Foundation) and Eugene Kim (OpenRank), Jenya Nepoimannykh (OpenRank).The Foundational Method: Capturing the Web of Trust via Recursive Trust GraphGiven a community of peers, their interactions with each other form a directed graph. Here, the peers become nodes within the graph and their interactions are the graph edges. These asymmetric edges can be viewed as trust arcs from one peer to the other. Additionally, the weight of each edge signals the degree of trust imparted by one peer onto another.The EigenTrust algorithm can then be run on such graphs to measure the impact of recursive trust propagation, leading to a global trust value for each peer or node in the network. Thus, every node gets assigned a reputation score. In a bipartite graph, there are two types of nodes, for example, GitHub repos as well as GitHub users as givers and receivers of trust forms a bipartite graph. EigenTrust not only works well with peer-to-peer data, but it can also be used for bipartite graphs, the implementation of which is achieved using the Hubs and Authorities algorithm. In a bipartite graph, there are two types of nodes, for example, GitHub repos as well as GitHub users as givers and receivers of trust forms a bipartite graph.The Goal of the Exercise and the Choice of AlgorithmGoalTo rank developers, identified by their GitHub accounts, based on their proximity to OP Stack repos.ApproachOpenRank enables verifiable compute for a large class of reputation algorithms, **in particular those that (a) operate on a graph, (b) are iterative in nature and (c) have a tendency toward convergence. In the following sections, we give a brief overview of some of these algorithms.For our Developer ranking use case, we obtained a graph of relevant GitHub event data from Open Source Observer, covering more than 2,000 organizations and over 30,000 code repositories. We established two kinds of peers: GitHub users and repositories. We then used a variation of EigenTrust, the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, which computes rankings on an asymmetric bipartite trust graph.Below are the two different trust edges used in the graph:User-to-repository trust- this signals the user’s interest in the repository through actions such as stars, forks and issue/PR submissions.Repository-to-user trust- this signals the credit extended by the repository to the user for their contribution. Actions such as PRs merged, direct code commits received, and other maintenance actions.The reason for using these two different and asymmetric trust arcs between users and GitHub repositories is to ensure accuracy and sybil resistance in the rankings. For trust-critical use cases, shared interest signal is often not necessarily a good measure of trust. For example, sybil actors can create thousands of trust arcs directed to a malicious or irrelevant repository. We solve this in two ways, choose a set of somewhat trustworthy/useful seed peers (GitHub repositories); and using a trust arc from a repository to a user based on a relevant credit signal such as merging a PR.Once the compute is run, the resulting global trust can be used for ranking both users and GitHub repositories.Compute Model Assumptions and WeightsTrust SignalsIn this model, we use developers (GitHub username) and OP Stack repositories as nodes in the trust graph. We establish trust arcs between users and repositories and vice versa in the following manner:User-to-repository actions (interest signals) include:Starring the repositoryForking the repositoryOpening an issueOpening a pull requestDirectly committing to the repositoryRepository-to-user actions (credit signals) include:Having a pull request merged into the repository (approximated by opening of a pull request as of this exercise)Directly committing to the repositoryRepository maintenance, such as merging a PR, resolving an issue, etc.Choice of Seed Peers and Alpha ValueSeed peers are core OP Stack repo, weighted by their relative importance.Core repos with higher importance (weight =2)‘testinprod-op-erigon’‘a16z/magi’,‘ethereum-optimism/optimism’,‘ethereum-optimism/op-geth’,‘ethereum-optimism/asterisc’,‘ethereum-optimism/kona’,‘ethereum-optimism/design-docs’,‘ethereum-optimism/specs’Other core repos with importance (weight=1)‘ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops’,‘ethereum-optimism/op-analytics’Alpha (α) Valueα is a parameter in EigenTrust algorithm that determines the significance of seed peers influence that shapes the reputation score of every other peers in the entire network. Alpha value is normally chosen between 0 and 0.5 and the higher the alpha the stronger the influence of seed peers, meaning the trust arc from seed peers to other peers will matter more for a peer’s relative reputation.A weak alpha value ( α=0.2 ) is chosen in this exercise, intending to discover more repos related to OP stack, and attribute contribution back to developers. Relatively less influential seed peers could let the other peers express more reputation credit to other repos and peers, therefore suits the purpose of the exercise. To read more about alpha value, check out the EigenTrust documentationhere.Reasoning of the Weights Choices for Trust ArcsThe weight ratio in the same class of actions (user-to-repo, or repo-to-user) matters.User-to-repo weights signals the seriousness of interest as well as the effort that would go into the action. Least to most significant: Forking < (committing directly, starring) < (opening issue, merging PR) < opening PR. A relative weight was assigned accordingly.Forking is a chore when someone wants to take a look at the repo and try something out quickly. (weight=1)Starring is a long-term interest signal to get updates from the repo and also skew the feed. (weight=5)Opening an issue actually takes nonnegligible effort. (weight=10)Opening a PR takes more effort as it also has proposed changes. PR opening reflects an original work. (weight =20)PR merging reflects a maintenance/review action. Typically it takes more effort for someone to create a patch and open a PR than to review it. (weight =10)Direct commits would normally sit between opening an issue and opening a PR; there are a lot of automated direct commits/pushes so we dial it down to the same level as opening an issue. (weight=5)Repo-to-user weight signals the degree of credit “thank you” from the repo(’s maintainers) to contributors (users). It can be thought of credit/“thank you” from the repository to the contributors.  Least to most significant: merging PR (maintainer action) < direct commits (maintainer/allow-listed contributor action) < authoring and submitting a PR (which was eventually merged). A relative weight was assigned accordingly.Iteration on the Ranking ResultsThere were several rounds of iteration on the algorithm, but it should by no means be interpreted to be in its final state. The process of adjusting and improving an algorithm of this type is a continuing effort and we imagine that this algorithm still has room for improvement, but is of sufficient quality for use in this experiment.The first iteration of the algorithm appeared to overvalue outdated repos, so we added a time decay function. We also adjusted the weight of seed repos to reflect the relative importance to the OP stack. In running the algorithm we discovered that the choice between an alpha value of 0.5 and 0.2 did not have a significant effect on the ranking.Discussion: Future Optimizations and Sybil-resistanceThis is the first iteration of using OpenRank to compute reputation within OP Stack based on data inputs from Open Source Observer, eg: Github event data. A few topics can be explored further.Additional Signals for Increasing Model Performance and Sybil ResistanceUsing real (non-approximated) signal of having a pull request merged into the repositoryInstead of approximating “opened PR = merged PR”Parsing GitHub events for more concrete signs of collaboration (eg, comments on issues, co-authored pull requests) and assessing the quality of those collaboration signals (eg, a conversation taking place over multiple weeks might be higher signal than one over a shorter interval)Both interest signals and credit signals are captured in the same local trust matrix.  The local trust may also capture user-user and repo-repo trust signals (the latter being, once again, the success attribution signals), so the graph is not necessarily bipartite. Some examples:Following/Starring other usersRepository dependencies (if repo A depends on repo B, A’s success should be attributed to B)Factoring Action’s Size into the Trust Arc WeightExample: PR importance (e.g. documentation fix < a whole new feature)Subjective factor (what kind of PR is it?  feature? bug fix? doc? does the project use labels for these?)Objective factor (change size?)Expanded Seed TrustUse a wider selection of OP-related repos so users’ contribution to those repos will directly increase the user’s trust standing via the seed trustTry and include both actors and objects in the seed.  Actors-only or objects-only seed trust often yields to slow convergence.Associate different weights to seed repos, e.g. according to their importanceAbout OpenRankOpenRankis a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any developer.The Verifiability of OpenRank powered Reputation ScoresAs a reputation protocol, the permissionless verifiability of the scores is a key property of OpenRank’s proposition. The verification methods that we propose are far cheaper than verification of general purpose computations, based on the intuition that iterative convergent algorithms on a graph are expensive to compute, but inexpensive to check (typically requiring one matrix-vector multiplication to check for convergence). This makes it far more practical to use this reputation computer for these use cases than a general purpose decentralized compute network.Contactgloria@karma3labs.comto access the full preliminary litepaper.To run the code yourself, start by creating a Google Cloud account and subscribe to the dataset following the below guides:docs.opensource.observerGet Started | Open Source ObserverThere are two easy ways of accessing OSO datasets: through our GraphQL APIdocs.opensource.observerData Overview | Open Source ObserverFirst, you need to set up your BigQuery account.

Badgeholder Onchain Analysis,"This research analysis was conducted with the Optimism Foundation as part of theFoundation Grant.TL;DRThis analysis examines the on-chain behaviors of Badgeholders within the Superchain ecosystem, which includes OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, and Mode. It contrasts these findings with those of Non-Badgeholders across both Superchain and Non-Superchain chains, such as Ethereum and Arbitrum. The study shows that Badgeholders, despite having significant account age, exhibit lower overall activity levels compared to Non-Badgeholders. Notably, Badgeholders demonstrate a strong preference for Ethereum transactions and tend to focus their activities on a limited number of decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms. Additionally, more than half of the Badgeholders maintain connections with Farcaster, indicating a high level of social engagement. These insights will assist the Optimism Collective in developing effective strategies to increase Badgeholder participation and integration within the broader Superchain ecosystem.IntroductionThe primary goal of this mission is to establish a comprehensive baseline understanding of the current Badgeholder demographic within the Superchain ecosystem. By examining the on-chain activities of Badgeholders in comparison to Non-Badgeholders, this study aims to identify key behavioral patterns and differences. The analysis focuses on four main dimensions: activity duration, cross-chain engagement, application usage, and the prevalence of Farcaster connections. The insights gained from this analysis will support the Optimism Collective in its objective of expanding the Citizenry, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions about community engagement strategies and resource allocation to promote growth and sustainability.MethodsData for this analysis was carefully collected from two primary sources:EAS Attestation for Badgeholders(EAS Attestations): Thisdatasetincludes 132 RPGF Badgeholder addresses, and among these, a separatedatasetconsists of 102 addresses that have ENS labels linked to them. This information is essential for examining activities specific to Badgeholders, such as transaction behavior and engagement patterns across various applications.Dune Dashboard: This analytical platform was utilized to gather extensive transaction data and additional insights regarding Non-Badgeholders. The focus included a range of activity categories, including token transfers, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), NFT trades, and perpetual trading, providing a comprehensive view of user engagement within the Superchain ecosystem.To ensure a balanced comparison, Non-Badgeholders were categorized into two distinct groups based on specific criteria:Group 1 (132 addresses):This groupconsists of a comparative sample that matches the number of Badgeholders. All members meet rigorous criteria, including a minimum of 300 transactions on the Optimism network and at least 8 transactions within any single month, ensuring that the comparison is made with an equivalent level of activity.Group 2 (1,320 addresses):This larger datasetis used for additional comparative analysis, adhering to similar transactional criteria to provide insights into broader sample size and a deeper understanding of user behavior.For detailed data collection methods, please refer to the (Research Work):-Behind the scenesdocumentation.Results:Activity DurationBadgeholders have an average account age of 461 days, while Non-Badgeholders in Group 1 average 467 days and those in Group 2 average 469 days. This indicates that Badgeholders are relatively newer but have engagement levels similar to those of Non-Badgeholders.In tracking monthly activity, Badgeholders peaked at 84 active users in April 2024, compared to 122 in Group 1 and 115 in Group 2. Activity levels increased notably from April 2022, followed by stabilization through late 2022.Image1055×435 23.7 KBSource -Average Account Age of Badgeholders and Non-BadgeholdersImage1910×836 51.3 KBSource:Monthly Active Badgeholders & Non-BadgeholdersImage1910×834 92.9 KBSource Link:-Account age and transaction count of badgeholders & non-badgeholdersThe analysis of account age versus transaction activity revealed no significant correlation; both newer and older accounts exhibited diverse transaction volumes.In terms of user engagement, 94.69% of Badgeholders and 100% of Non-Badgeholders remained active for over two years. As of June 27, 2024, there are 87 active Badgeholders compared to 121 in Group 1 and 1,186 in Group 2, highlighting varying engagement levels within the ecosystem.Cross-Chain Activity OverviewBadgeholders average 410 transactions on Superchain chains and 597 transactions on Non-Superchain networks, while Non-Badgeholders in Group 1 average 997 transactions on Superchain, and Group 2 significantly leads with 8,368 transactions. This indicates that larger Non-Badgeholder groups are more active within Superchain.Image1061×447 39.1 KBSource Link:-Transaction Counts on Different chainsInterestingly, Non-Badgeholders consistently outperform Badgeholders on Superchain networks, particularly on OP Mainnet, while Badgeholders exhibit the highest activity on Ethereum, where 52.4% of their transactions occur.Overall, Badgeholders tend to favor Non-Superchain networks, but Non-Badgeholders, especially from larger groups, demonstrate higher transaction volumes on Superchain, indicating effective user engagement.Image1910×836 89.8 KBSource link:-Monthly transaction count of Badgeholders & Non-BadgeholdersTransaction activity trends reveal significant growth for Non-Badgeholders, particularly in the larger group, reflecting increasing engagement, while Badgeholders also show upward trends, highlighting evolving dynamics of user participation in the blockchain landscape.Activity Levels:The transaction activity analysis on Superchain networks indicates that Badgeholders have an average transaction count of 413.42 in the top percentiles, reflecting solid engagement. In contrast, specific Non-Badgeholder groups show even higher activity, with Group 1 averaging 1,001.86 transactions and Group 2 averaging 8,394.85 transactions. This highlights that while Badgeholders are engaged, certain Non-Badgeholder segments are exceptionally active, revealing varying levels of participation within the Superchain ecosystem.Application Usage:The analysis of transaction patterns across Superchain chains reveals distinct engagement levels between Badgeholders and Non-Badgeholders. Badgeholders demonstrate a strong preference for token-transfer activities, accounting for 86% of their transactions, followed by 9.3% in DEX transactions, with minimal activity in NFTs, social interactions, and DAO governance. In contrast, Non-Badgeholders in Group 1 also show a preference for token transfers at 85%, but they are more active in DEX transactions (12.3%). Non-Badgeholders in Group 2 emphasize token transfers even more (95.8%) while showing limited engagement in other categories, particularly NFTs and DAO governance. Overall, token-transfer activities dominate all user segments, highlighting a significant preference for decentralized exchange transactions across the Superchain ecosystem.Image1053×437 24.4 KBSource Link:-Top 10 DEX Applications used by badgeholdersImage1910×836 142 KBSource Link:-Monthly Transaction count of Badgeholders on different DEX applicationsOur analysis of Farcaster data for Badgeholders reveals intriguing user behavior patterns. Among the 132 Badgeholders, only three have custody addresses that directly match their Badgeholder addresses on Farcaster, indicating minimal direct matches. However, 70 Badgeholders (53%) appear on the verified list, suggesting that many users initially join Farcaster with alternative addresses and later add their Badgeholder addresses as verified. This behavior may reflect a strategic approach to managing digital identities or maintaining privacy.Farcaster VerificationA significant portion of Badgeholders, approximately 70 individuals, have successfully linked their Ethereum addresses to a Farcaster account. This high verification rate indicates a notable level of engagement and trust between Badgeholders and the Farcaster platform. Furthermore, transactions involving verified Badgeholders account for 61% of total transactions, compared to 39% from non-verified Badgeholders. This difference suggests that Farcaster verification is associated with higher engagement levels within the Superchain ecosystem.When examining the correlation between the number of Ethereum addresses linked to a Farcaster account and transaction volume, we find that Badgeholders with 3 to 4 connected addresses typically conduct over 1,000 transactions. Interestingly, some Badgeholders with a single connected address have reached up to 1,825 transactions, indicating that factors beyond network size, such as individual engagement levels and specific use cases, influence transaction activity.Image1055×442 30.2 KBSource Link:-Activity count of badgeholders with Farcaster verificationSmart Contract DeploymentOur research into smart contract deployment among Badgeholders reveals a significant difference. Only 0.8% of Badgeholders have deployed smart contracts on Superchain chains, with the overwhelming majority (99.2%) not participating in this advanced blockchain activity. Notably, no Badgeholders on the Optimism chain have deployed smart contracts, highlighting a significant gap in the utilization of these capabilities within the community.Temporal DifferencesWhen comparing the activity levels of Badgeholders from earlier rounds (RPGF Round 2) to those from later rounds (RPGF Round 3), we observe notable differences in transaction activity across various Superchain chains. Additionally, category engagement analysis shows that current Badgeholders are more active in the NFT sector on platforms like OpenSea, which has seen a substantial increase in engagement from 1 to 12.9 normalized counts. Conversely, engagement on Quix has decreased from 3.9 to 0.7. In the DEX category, there is a clear shift toward projects like Velodrome and Balancer, with Velodrome experiencing a significant rise in engagement from 4.7 to 24.2 normalized counts.Image1910×768 34.3 KBSource Link:-NFT Transaction countConclusionThis analysis of Badgeholders within the Superchain ecosystem reveals several important behavioral patterns. While Badgeholders have similar levels of experience to Non-Badgeholders, they tend to focus more on Ethereum for their transactions and prefer specific applications like Uniswap, Velodrome, and OpenSea. Although they engage more in token-transfer activities, their participation in areas such as DEX trading and smart contract deployment remains limited compared to Non-Badgeholders. The high level of Farcaster integration indicates strong social engagement within this group, yet there are opportunities for increased technical participation. These insights provide valuable guidance for the Optimism Collective in enhancing Badgeholder involvement and growing the Citizenry within the Superchain ecosystem.ResourcesReport Link:ReportDune Dashboard Link:Dune DashboardEAS Attestation Link:EAS AttestationsResearch Work:Behind the scenes"

Badgeholder Onchain Analysis Report,"Optimism Badgeholder On-Chain AnalysisSummaryOptimism Badgeholders play an essential role in fueling the next generation of talent by rewarding current impactful work within the Optimism Collective and incentivizing the continuation of such work. For this reason, it is important to understandhow Badgeholders compare to typical active OP users. This knowledge will help governance make informed decisions in the design and expansion of the Citizen’s House while providing transparency to the public about the voters in the OP Collective. When looking at Badgeholders from the first three rounds of Retro Funding voting, we found that a higher percentage of OP Badgeholders are active in other DAOs, are involved in the creation of NFTs and Smart Contracts and have verified Farcaster accounts in comparison to a control group of active users.This study was done in conjunction with the Optimism Foundation as part of aFoundation Grant. All source data and charts can be referenced atthis dune dashboard.IntroductionOptimism Badgeholders have been an essential part of the Collective since the inception of the Citizen’s House, playing a key role in voting on important governance decisions such as the design and distribution of Retro Funding. Through these votes, they have been responsible for distributing over 50 million OP tokens during Retro Funding (RF) rounds. This makes their participation crucial in rewarding impactful work and encouraging continued contributions within the OP Collective. To better understand the influence of Badgeholders and ensure governance decisions are made transparently and equitably, it is important to compare them to typical active OP users. Here we explore OP Badgeholder’s transaction activity, governance participation, social app usage and smart contract deployment to better understand the characteristics of OP Badgeholders.MethodsOur work includes the 132 Badgeholder addresses that acted as voters for Round 3. It is important to note that Badgeholders may hold other addresses and may not exclusively conduct their blockchain activity using the address linked to their Badgeholder status. Indeed, four Badgeholders had only one transaction associated with their address, and 17 had fewer than 10 transactions. However, a substantial portion—31 Badgeholders—were highly active, with more than 1,000 transactions linked to their address.We built a representative control group by selecting all non-Badgeholders addresses that conducted at least five transactions on Optimism in the last three months. This threshold was chosen to capture active users while avoiding including inactive or irregular participants. This resulted in a control group of approximately 1,160,000 addresses. We decided to use relatively broad qualifications for the control group to see best how Badgeholders compared to typical active Optimism users. For finer-scale comparisons and statistical tests, we used a random subset of 1,000 users from the control group. This subset was randomly selected from the larger control group. In cases where this smaller control group was used, it will be referred to as the subset control group.ResultsAs of August 15th, 2024 OP Badgeholders had completed 150,343 transactions, with 57,909 (39%)on OP Stack Chains vs 92,434 (61%) on non-stack chains. Badgeholders had a median of 315 total transactions, with a median of 56 on-chain transactions and 237.5 non-OP stack chain transactions.Transaction ActivityThe largest percentage of Badgeholder transactions occurred on Ethereum (43%), followed by Optimism (27%). In contrast, the control group had its highest transaction percentage on Optimism (23%), with Polygon coming in second (20%). Notably, in the last month (August 2024), the most frequent chain for Badgeholder transactions was to Base (33%), with Optimism following closely at 26%. The control group showed a had most of its transactions in Optimism (32%) with Base in second at 25%.image1802×792 48.2 KBimage1802×792 50.4 KBWhen comparing OP Stack chain activity between groups, 39% of Badgeholder transactions occurred on OP Stack chains with a similar 40% of control group transactions occurring on OP Stack Chains. However, in August 2024, both groups showed a higher level of OP Stack chain engagement, with 60% of Badgeholder transactions and 62% of the control group’s transactions occurring on OP stack chains. This suggests that both groups may be increasingly prioritizing OP Stack chains.image1322×688 37 KBDAO ParticipationBadgeholders exhibit significantly higher involvement in governance across multiple chains. Badgeholders were more active in ENS (7%) and Uniswap (3%) DAOs compared to the control group, which had less than 1% participation in both DAOs. Overall similar percentages of Badgeholders and members of the control group are active in Arbitrum DAO. However, among the top 300 members of the Arbitrum DAO, 2% of Badgeholders held prominent positions (p < 0.0001), a percentage far exceeding that of the control group. All of these patterns suggests that Badgeholders are highly influential in cross-ecosystem governance.image974×792 36.6 KBimage974×792 35.4 KBSocial App UsageOver half of Badgeholders (59%) hold verified Farcaster accounts, a large contrast to just 12% in the control group. On other social applications both Badgeholders and the control group show low rates of engagement, less than 10% have Lens profiles and less than 1% have traded Friendtech shares.image1228×792 39.7 KBimage1228×792 36.9 KBNFT & Smart Contract ActivityBadgeholders are significantly more likely to hold NFTs, with 53% owning NFTs compared to 38% of the control group. Additionally, Badgeholders demonstrated a higher rate of smart contract creation on Optimism with 9 Badgeholders creating a total of 22 smart contracts. This indicates that Badgeholders are not only active in governance but also contribute more to the technical development of the ecosystem.image2496×792 55.8 KBConclusionsIn conclusion, Badgeholders in the Optimism Collective demonstrate a unique pattern of activity compared to typical active OP users. They are more engaged in governance across multiple DAOs, significantly more active on social platforms like Farcaster, and more involved in NFT creation and smart contract deployment. Though their transaction behavior on different chains varies slightly from that of the control group, both groups show similar percentages of transactions on OP Stack Chains. We hope that this dashboard and these findings will help inform the design of future Retrofunding rounds, and that the comparison to typical active wallets will help provide more context in the decisions around guest voting that will happen in Retrofunding Round 6.The full dune dashboard can be foundhere."
Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' House,"Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens’ HouseWhat is random sampling?Random sampling is a widely used statistical method in which all members of a population (all Citizens) have the same probability of being selected. Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection.This method is widely used in a variety of disciplines when little is known about the entire population and/or extracting information from the entire population would be costly or infeasible. This is a powerful tool when considering the expansion of Citizenship and the increase in the number of rounds per year.Does random sampling presuppose Citizens are interchangable? -joanbpIt doesn’t! In fact, it makes no assumptions about Citizens at all, which is why one of the major advantages of random sampling is the reduction of bias that can occur via subsets selected in any other way. Opt-in methods are particularly susceptible to various biases and can create opportunities for capture by a small, active, and likely unrepresentative subset. Random samplingonlyassumes that each participant had an equal probability of selection.Why use random sampling now?Some of the most commonfeedbackin Round 3 was the need to more effectively scale the Retro Funding process (it was too time consuming for badgeholders!) and to provide more predictability for builders. There are a variety of measures we are introducing to address this feedback, including more frequent and narrowly scoped rounds. When scaling to four rounds per year (a 4x increase), we felt it was important to keep the expectation on badgeholder time relatively fixed (or even to reduce it.) Allowing badgeholders to opt-in to rounds limits the number of voices that are heard and may skew or bias the results towards a small subset of Citizens that are able to dedicate the most time. Full participation in all rounds, on the other hand, demands too much time and effort of the whole group. By requiring full badgeholder participation in two rounds and splitting participation between the other two rounds using random sampling, we believe we can achieve this goal. Throughout Season 6, we plan to experiment with random sampling as an alternate or additional method to reduce the workload required of any one badgeholder. More on why we believe this is a worthwhile experiment below.Why random sampling, specifically in the Citizens’ House?Should only the most highly engaged Citizens be selected to participate? -gonnaThe Token House scales via political representation, which while increasing participation and (potentially) context, also concentrates power. Delegation increases participation but concentrates power among large delegates.  In this context, elected Councils, which delegate decision making power over specific decisions to a one member/one vote Council, can actuallyreducethe concentration of power in the Token House. A weakness of this model, which we will have to actively combat, is that it’s easy for the ~50 most highly engaged delegates to become responsible for making most decisions.In contrast, the Citizens’ House operates via a one Citizen, one vote model which distributes powerevenlyamong the Citizenry, appearing much closer to a democracy. Elections, delegation, and/or otherpolitical scaling methodswill concentrate power in the Citizens’ House. The downsides of these approaches in traditional democracies are thoroughly outlined inOpen Democracy. One ofHélène Landemore’smain hypotheses is that random sampling (sortition) can be used to avoid these downsides without a meaningful impact on collective outputs (paraphrased.)Reducing the concentration of power is one of the maingoalsof the Citizens’ House and random sampling is a well tested method that could allow the Citizens’ House to avoid a common failure mode of other governance systems: capture by a small subset or minority interest. Accordingly, we believe it is worth experimenting with random sampling to enable the Citizens’ House to scaleby using statistical, rather than political, methods.With power evenly distributed among Citizens, the Citizens’ House may serve as a more effective check on the Token House.In short, the intention is not that sampling be representative of a smaller subset of a certain type of Citizens, but rather to approximate a response from the entire Citizenry. High context, highly engaged Citizens should absolutely be recognized, rewarded, and respected within the Collective. Random sampling is not at odds with any of those objectives though!"
Cross Posting - Experimentation with Citizenship,"This is an article in thegovernance docs, cross-posted here for better visibilityThe Citizens’ House is half of the Optimism Collective’s bicameral governance system, designed to work alongside the pure token-voting based Token House.The purpose of the Citizens’ House is to:Reduce the concentration of power in the CollectiveSafeguard against the capture of the Token HouseAllocate resources according to the long-term benefit to the CollectiveAny changes to the Citizens’ House, including changes to Citizen selection, should be evaluated based on their contribution to these objectives.Taking an experimental approach to Citizen selectionAn experimental approach to Citizen selection ensures that changes are made based on evidence rather than gut feeling. Guesswork and informed opinions play a part in the formation of hypotheses, but diverging opinions are settled through hypothesis-testing. This process ensures that as Citizen selection evolves over time, it is always evolving in the direction of progress towards the objectives. Changes that have an undesirable effect are rolled back, and mistakes are learned from to inform future improvements.Disclaimer:The types of experiments run in the name of Citizen selection are unlikely to be double-blind controlled trials. We seek to use the principles and practices of experimentation to the maximum extent feasible, with the aim of growing the amount of high-confidence knowledge about Citizen selection that the Collective has access to.Experimentation on Citizen selection in practiceEffective experimentation with Citizen selection has several prerequisites:The ability to measure both input and outcome variablesShort feedback cyclesReversibilityMeasuring both input and outcome variablesTo run effective experiments, the inputs and outcomes of those experiments must be measurable. Inputs (independent variables) are the aspects of Citizen selection that we want to change or influence, and outcomes (dependent variables) are the measurable effects of the experiment, usually tied to the overall objective we want to achieve. A large effort is underway to improve our ability to measure key aspects of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding), Citizens’ House performance and other aspects of the Citizenry.Short feedback cyclesEffective experimentation often involves testing many different variables in different conditions. In order to make efficient progress, we need to be able to run a lot of experiments and learn from them quickly. Increasing the number of Retro Funding iterations per year and introducing new opportunities for experiments can allow us to shorten feedback cycles.ReversibilityThe primary objective of experimentation is to learn. Experiments are a risk - we are never sure what the outcome will be, otherwise there would be no need for an experiment. Any changes made to Citizen selection in the name of experimentation must therefore be reversible. The concept of guest voters in Retro Funding experiments is one way to ensure reversibility of experiments.Citizen selection experimentsThe purpose of experimentation with Citizen selection is to increase the Collective’s knowledge about the effectiveness of various different selection mechanisms to ultimately enable effective future decisions. Experiments are currently run as part of the planned Retro Funding iterations that happen multiple times per year, with experiment outcomes being shared publicly at the end of each experiment.For each Retro Funding iteration, a different selection mechanism may be tested by selecting a limited number of guest voters to participate in the round. Guest voters are temporary participants in Retro Funding votes, and should not be confused with Citizens who participate in protocol upgrade proposal vetoes in addition to Retro Funding votes. The purpose of introducing guest voters is to increase the reversibility of experiments.Increased data collection around Retro Funding votes and their participants is also an essential component of measuring experiment outcomes, and may take several forms:Surveys distributed to voters, builders and other stakeholdersAn analysis of voting behavior within and across Retro Funding votesMeasuring the concentration of power through social graph analysisAnother essential type of data required for experimentation with Citizen selection is identity and ‘reputation’ data. This forms an important input into selection mechanisms themselves and is therefore essential to the Collective’s ability to experiment with various approaches.Identity, reputation and Citizen selectionThere are a myriad of variations of the above approaches to Citizen selection that may be tested experimentally. Many such selection mechanisms rely on information about prospective Citizens to make selection decisions. Building a rich identity layer within the Collective allows these kinds of selection mechanisms to function.By enabling individual members of the Collective to build and maintain their identity as a Collective participant, potentially relevant information about the individual can be factored into the selection process. For example, some selection mechanisms may use someone’s professional contributions to the Collective as a deciding factor in whether they should be Citizens. Another might use the duration and depth of engagement with apps built on the Superchain. These are just hypothetical examples, but they illustrate the importance of individual identity in being able to test all selection mechanisms.Building outthe identity stack(opens in a new tab)ensures that the Optimism Collective is able to effectively experiment with all possible selection mechanisms to identify those with the best performance. It is therefore a core building block in the development of Citizenship. Without adequate data on potential candidate Citizens and the performance of the Citizenry on its objectives, it is impossible to experiment with selection criteria.To recapA solid and shared foundation of knowledge and data from open-sourced experiments is essential for the Collective’s decision-making ability.Experimentation with selection criteria is the most effective way to increase knowledge around the effectiveness of various approaches to Citizen selection.Measurement of inputs and outcomes of Citizen selection, short feedback loops and reversible changes are essential prerequisites for the Collective to build up a reliable process for experimentation.The Optimism Foundation currently runs experiments on Citizen selection using guest voters in Retro Funding iterations with the help of surveys, voting analysis and other methods to measure experiment outcomes."

Ratification of Profit Definition for Round 4,"Ratification of Profit Definition for Round 4Impact = profitOptimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) has been built around the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded as:Impact = profit.This principle serves as a North Star to motivate the creation of a more productive and sustainable ecosystem.In previous Retro Funding rounds, each Citizen conducted their own assessment of impact and decided how to calculate profit by considering the past rewards received by projects and deducting that amount from impact to arrive at a final OP allocation. This non-standardized approach sparkedvarious debateswithin the community about whether external funding (e.g., VC funding, Optimism grants, or external grants) should be deducted from a project’s overall public goods funding reward.Round 4 DefinitionInRetro Funding 4: Onchain Builders, a definition of profit will be universally applied to the retro round. Badgeholders will no longer need to calculate profit, but instead, a collective definition will be applied and subtracted from each voter’s assessment of impact as such:Impact - Past transfers = Award in OPThe possible categories considered as Past Transfers are:Grants from OptimismVC fundingGrants from other ecosystemsRevenue.All data collected on this categories in the Round 4 application process was for the timeframe of Jan 2023 - May 23rd, 2024.Deliberative ProcessOver the past month, a randomly selected subset of badgeholdersexperimented with a deliberative processto determine this profit definition for Round 4.

This definition is:Impact = Award in OPThe deliberative process experiment surfaced the amount of complexity, nuance, and effort required to accurately define profit and the challenges in verifying self-reported profit data which is oftentimes not publicly disclosed.

Experimenting with Deliberative Processes in the Collective,"Experimenting with Deliberative Processes in the CollectiveAs outlined in thePath to Open Metagovernance, Optimism takes an experimental approach to the development of the Collective’s governance system. One of ourgoalsfor Retro Funding in 2024, is to test a few clear hypotheses in each round, the results of which will inform the design of future rounds and/or other parts of the governance system.image1190×1000 51.2 KBWhile the Foundation facilitates this iterative process, with the help of theCollective Feedback Commission, any member of the community may contribute to this process. Inspired by a community member’spost, we will test the below hypothesis, among others, during Retro Funding 4:A deliberative process can allow voters to come to consensus on a subject that would otherwise be difficult to come to consensus on.More specifically, we want to understand whether voter participation in a deliberative process increases agreement on a contested topic, and whether the resulting decision leads to broader satisfaction and clarity in the Retro Funding process.We will run this initial experiment as a pilot that could later be scaled to a larger sample size, applied to other parts of the Optimism governance system, and/or expanded to include an in-person assembly, if the preliminary findings are promising.  Specifically, we think a deliberative process could be useful in the setting of collective definitions and/or shared values, preventing gridlock between Houses, coming to collective consensus on complex topics, and/or the future creation of critical governance documents, similar to theLaw of Chains.What are Deliberative Processes?In its modern meaning, deliberation refers to a collective decision making process which aims to reduce the impact of power structures in discussion. In practice, it generally involves a set of three principles:Informed, structured, and facilitated discussion of pros and cons about a topic.A process that progresses from individual opinions towards collective judgement.A recruitment of a representative group to have the discussion. This is mostly achieved through “sortition” (random selection of participants).Deliberative democracy has roots all the way back to Aristotle but deliberative processes have been flourishing over the past 20 years in local and global discussions (seeherefor many use cases). This method is currently utilized by the likes of the European Commission (to shape the directive on Food Waste, or the strategy on Virtual Worlds:https://citizens.ec.europa.eu/european-citizens-panels_en), national governments (more than 20+ such discussions have been held on Climate policy), or local governments (1000+ participatory budgeting discussions allowing citizens to allocate public funds to projects from the community).Tech platforms such asMetaandOpenAIhave explored deliberative processes among their users to discuss topics related to governing AI. In web3, Cosmos hasexperimentedwith deliberative processes to determine the process and principles for adding or removing chains to the Atom Economic Zone (AEZ).What are Deliberative Processes Useful For?More Informed Decision-Making: A deliberative process can aid a diverse group of voters with different perspectives and expertise in navigating complex topics without relying on popular opinions, resorting to groupthink, being pressured into conformity, or being driven towards partisanship.Greater Chance for Social Cohesion:Deliberative processes can incorporate varied viewpoints in the process of coming to a shared consensus and promote greater social cohesion between people from different backgrounds. We’ve seen the opposite play out when the community has attempted to come to consensus in the absence of a structured deliberative process.Credibly Neutral Consensus:Structured deliberation gives participants an equal opportunity to discuss and debate the merits and drawbacks of multiple options among a representative sample rather than letting the loudest voices prevail in an unstructured social media debate. This process, facilitated by an expert external third party, can also reduce the influence of special interests (and the Foundation) in the formation of policy.Buy-In:Deliberative processes can increase the legitimacy of decision making via participation in the policymaking process. Voters may be more likely to commit to and/or abide by policies that have been proposed and agreed-upon amongst themselves.Retro Funding 4 DeliberationA subset of 50 Round 4 voters will be randomly selected to participate in the deliberative experiment. Randomly sampling individuals to make governance decisions (also called sortition) is common practice in deliberative democracy as higher quality discussion can be had with a smaller, but still representative, sample of the population. We will also experiment with sortition in Round 6.This subset of voters will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro Funding Round 4, facilitated by a team specialized in designing and running such processes (fromMissions PubliquesandRnDAO). This subset will be provided with balanced information on the topic to be debated in advance of the deliberations. Participants will work in a combination of plenary and subgroup settings across 2 sessions:Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft output of the deliberation. Also, the plenary moments of the sessions will be opened to the full set of voters in Round 4. This allows for the broader community to better understand and trust the decision-making process. The full Citizens’ House will ratify the output of the deliberative process before Round 4 voting begins.The ratified outcome will be incorporated directly into the Retro Funding 4 voting mechanism.Next StepsIn 2024, you can expect to see a more scientific and interdisciplinary approach to research and experimentation in the Collective (thanks to our new Research and Experiments Lead,@elizaoak.) We’re excited to begin by testing a hypothesis that originated from a community member on the forums, and to experiment with an approach that empowers voters to address contested topics without interference from the Foundation.The Foundation will share additional details on the specifics of the deliberation on the forum before reaching out to the 50 randomly selected Round 4 voters via email."

Zach Obront - Developer Advisory Board Operating Budget,"Proposed Board Lead:Zach ObrontProposed Board Operating Budget:90,000 OP (+20k from last season)Contact Info:zobront@gmail.comPrevious Work & QualificationsI work primarily as asecurity researcher.My work focuses substantially on the OP ecosystem. For example, I placed 1st in theaudit contest on the Bedrock Upgrade. I’ve also audited Base, Blast, and Fraxtal (all OP stack chains).I am organizing theFault Proof CTFevent this summer, which will serve as the final line of defense for the security of fault proofs before deploying to mainnet.I served on the Developer Advisory Board for Season 5, taking an active role in streamlining DAB processes to ensure the members were well coordinated.In my work with the DAB, I provided private feedback to the Grants Council, as well as providing public feedback on many Mission Requests and applications (ex:1,2,3).In a past life, I co-founded and ranScribe Media. This is irrelevant technically, but provided helpful experience in leading a team of 100+ people that will carry over to this role.Board Charter:Link to original Charter:Season 5 CharterThe Developer Advisor Board should be greatly expanded in Season 6 to make better use of the technical expertise of the group.Here is the proposed & expanded charter:Support the Optimism community through important technical decisions.Provide plain English explanations of all protocol upgrades for the community.Act as one of four delegate approvals that will be required before a Protocol Upgrade can move to a vote.Be available for consultation by delegates regarding important technical decisions, especially protocol upgrades.Support the Grants Council on evaluation technical Mission Requests.Review Mission Request drafts and provide guidance to the Grants Council, specifically focusing on their technical merits and whether the grant size is reasonable.Review applications for Mission Requests and provide guidance to the applicants as well as the Grants Council, specifically focusing on the team’s detailed plan and whether they seem to be capable of executing on the mission.Review work product delivered for milestones on existing grants to provide guidance on whether the milestones have been successfully achieved.Use “veto power” to keep Grants Council technically grounded (ie. a unanimous “no” vote by the DAB on any of these topics will block the Grants Council from voting “yes”).Bring an additional technical perspective to thinking about the vision of the OP ecosystem and what needs to happen to get there.Be available for discussions for any core OP devs to provide an outside voice on technical and security related decisions.Support in finding technical talent to fill important roles at OP Labs.Generate ideas for theBuilders Ideaslist to spur community contributions.Other Logistics:All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in theOperating ManualBreakdown of Board Operating Budget:Lead (1)= 25k OP (+5k from last season)The increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities based on the changes outlined in this proposal.Specifically, the Lead will be responsible for:(a) leading all board meetings,(b) interfacing with other areas in OP governance to ensure the DAB is supporting where possible,(c) working with Upgrade Czar on approving protocol upgrades,(d) providing feedback for DAB members on their performance,(e) exercising decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus, and(f) writing & sharing the retrospective after Season 6 on changes to improve the DAB going forward.Upgrade Czar (1)= 17.5k OP (+5k from last season)This role did not exist last season. All Members were paid 12.5k OP, and the increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities.Specifically, the Upgrade Czar is responsible for:(a) understanding the OP Stack deeply and reviewing all upgrades,(b) leading the DAB in discussing and approving these upgrades, and(c) writing up non-technical summaries of the changes for the communityOps Lead (1)= 17.5k OP (+5k from last season)This role did not exist last season. All Members were paid 12.5k OP, and the increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities.Specifically, the Ops Lead is responsible for ensuring that all DAB tasks are well orchestrated and happen on time, including:(a) improving the IOPs,(b) scheduling meetings,(c) interfacing with other Councils,(d) organizing spreadsheets for feedback, and(e) looking for any other opportunities to make changes that will keep the DAB’s efforts focused and effectiveOP Labs Representative (1)= 0 OP (equal to last season)Additional Members (3)= 10k OP each = 30k OP (-7.5k from last season)All Members were paid 12.5k OP last season, but also shared some of the responsibilities that will be taken on by the other roles this season.I believe 10k OP is sufficient to incentivize top talent to participate, especially given the possibility for RetroPGF.Note: If you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that the math on the changes doesn’t exactly add up. This is because, last season, one of the members (Noah) was unpaid. However, this budget includes the “worst case” assumption that all Members are paid, although it is possible that Noah (or someone else) opts to forfeit compensation.KPIs & MeasurementsUser Experience KPIs:Did 100% of Protocol Upgrades have a non-technical summary posted within 72 hours and get approval or comments from the DAB?What NPS score would the Grants Council reviewers provide (answering: “On a scale from 1-10, if it were up to you, how likely would you be to renew the DAB next season?”)What NPS score would the Citizens give the DAB (answering: “On a scale from 1-10, how much value do you feel the DAB provided the community this season?”)Performance KPIs:Did voting participation on Protocol Upgrades increase (including abstains) since the non-technical summaries were implemented?Did the number of milestones missed by grant recipients decrease on DAB-approved grants relative to grants before the DAB?Did the quality of technical grants chosen increase, as evaluated by members of the OP Labs engineering team?"
Code of Conduct Council - Retrospective Season 5,"Retrospective - Season 5First of all,thank youfor allowing the members of this Council for Season 5 to be part of the Collective. We have learned a lot and worked in favor of the participants of the Collective. We have conducted this Retrospective internally and want to share some important points with all of you.Please note that in some responses, there are various conclusions. We believe that seeing the different perspectives of the members is more important than reaching a consensus when submitting a Retrospective.1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?We believe we have achieved progress based on our mandate, there has been less governance overhead in the management of conflicts by the Foundation, and less voting around the Code of Conduct sanctions, contributing to theseGoals, by replacing the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct Violations and eliminating enforcement responsibilities for Token House delegates by entrusting the Code of Conduct Council to process disputes. To create accountability for the Code of Conduct Council, the Token House may veto enforcement actions at any timeGenerally, the introduction of Optimistic Enforcement of actions alone has already led to fewer votes needed from the Token House on these matters, we think we were effective at these goals.While the CoCC wasn’t perfect, we successfully achieved these goals by soaking up governance overhead that would have otherwise fallen on the token. Our small group size (as opposed to the large Token House) meant we could dedicate more time and attention to each case than the Token House could, which would have ideally led to more optimal outcomes for the cases. Finally, the fact the CoCC Members were drawn from rank-and-file members of the Optimism Community, increased the decentralization of Optimism Governance and minimized the need of the Foundation to remain in control.2. Impact assessment - how well did your team’s outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?All reports were discussed, with different perspectives being given for each case from members. The biggest output I am impressed with the Council has been the communications on the thread, with many members being able to handle publicly very sensitive threads.We managed cases that were a load on the Foundation and the community, taking off weight to specific areas and taking care of the public image of the collective. Managing conflict is one of those areas whose impact is invisible, and trying to measure it is paradoxical. It’s hard to reach a consensus in dicotomic situations and there will be a certain amount of descent to decisions we make. If we want to have conflict, to prove our capacity to manage it, we are incentivizing the first unwanted premise. If there are a few conflicts, we may think the group is not needed. It’s good that the conflict management offices are prepared for any emergency, and also that there are moments without conflict that prevention.I think it’s less important to discuss the team’s outputs, and more important to focus on the indirect benefit to the Optimism Collective that the CoCC provided. Our inner workings and outputs ultimately minimized governance overhead for the Token House, increased decentralization of the Collective, and led to better outcomes among disputes. Our group activities and communication across Optimism’s online platform and community events appeared to reduce the frequency of disputes, reduce incivility on the online platforms, and provide a support mechanism to community members who felt they had been wronged or generally unsafe in the community; i.e. We were always there if people needed us, and it appeared as if many in the community knew this.3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP’s)?Incentivizing people in the community to be closer to the COCC. We should be able to know about conflicts when they are small. If we are not seen close to the community, it will be harder to access cases and we’ll only perceive them when they are big.I think an important goal is to keep the IOPs simple, clear, and easy to understand and adhere to. With this as a goal, I am pleased that the CoCC did indeed dedicate significant time and energy to creating and/or refining the IOPs, while always seeking feedback from the community and the Foundation.4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter.Open the forms to not only strong Code of Conduct violations but also tearings of the social fabric, allowing feedback loops and notification of issues when they are small as fast as possible. Leading to not only Yes or No decisions, but to transforming polarities into informed dialogue spaces.A change that I’ve previously discussed, is that Reports should be received, processed, and reported on with 2 consecutive Voting Cycles, and not only one (i.e. the same) Voting Cycle. I believe this change would improve decision-making by the CoCC reduce pressures on CoCC Members and minimize conflicts among CoCC Members.Giving more space for innovation within the CoCC to innovations, for example, for this initial Season we started exploring within the Council the option to use Attestations within our decisions and roles, this was something that wasn´t part of the Charter, but I believe adding within the Charter a research or investigative area that includes an open mandate to innovate as Council would be seen by the members as an open playground. I also believe that working more closely with other members of the community generates a broader impact, for example, in future mandates, the CoCC can work more closely in experimenting under Missions or similar. Cross-collaboration is key, for the Attestations a member of the community,@LauNaMu, helped us understand more about Attestations and how these could be implemented within the Council in favor of the Collective. Something that also was in our conversations, was to see how could the CoCC could work together with other Protocols, such as Arbitrum, for issues that expand our borders, and are out of our scope, but still relevant to the Collective.5. What improvements to the team’s mandate would you suggest for next Season? If you don’t believe the team’s operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.I feel that ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) and report voting could be parallelized. The Council’s role in voting on behalf of the Token House cannot be assumed by any other entity, however, with additional resources we could expand and potentially onboard a more comprehensive method for resolutions beyond the council members themselves.I think we should continue next season, and be given support to pivot cases to facilitation of ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution). I think this experiment was fun and beneficial to the community and the participants of the COCC (Code of Conduct Council). In my opinion, for next season we can continue polishing and iterating based on what was built to support the community and the foundation in the better identification and processing of code of conduct violations and overall management of conflicts in the Optimism ecosystem.I think there can be two parallel streams to handle Reports. While the CoCC should remain the first ‘port-of-call’ or ‘first responder’ for all Reports, the CoCC should have the option to off-ramp selected cases to an external ADR body or process. The external ADR provider could provide increased expertise and dedicated time and staff for the longer term (supported or created by adequate funding) that could better handle these embedded, but recoverable disputes, in comparison to the direct CoCC. Cases that are not off-ramped to ADR would remain the responsibility of the CoCC, and the CoCC could increase the specialization, efficiency, and effectiveness in investigating, processing, adjudicating, and reporting on cases that lean more to obvious abuse, infractions, or breaches, as opposed to the human, personality or political disputes that are more likely breakdowns in the social fabric of the community but can still be recovered (i.e. these cases are handled by the ADR body).The mandate of the CoCC is of high importance to the Collective because due process is required when members of the Token House are subject to any kind of sanction, especially when this sanction involves not only deleting a post but also imposing higher sanctions such as limiting their ability to participate in the Forum.Potentially, this could be the last post from the members who are part of this initial experiment. We have forged bonds that we know will always be there among us. We thank you immensely once again for this opportunity.Regards,@gene@Axel_T@Juanbug_PGov@Oxytocin@juankbell@teresacd"
Anticapture Commission Communication Thread,"Welcome to the Anticapture Commission Communication Thread!The Anticapture Commission (ACC) is mandated to represent the interests of individual delegates as a key tokenholder group and to prevent the capture of the Token House by any single tokenholder or group of tokenholders, including protocols, OP Chains, etc. This program, introduced as an experiment in Season 5, consists of high-impact delegates who meet the membership criteria outlinedhereand have opted in.ExpectationsThis program is best understood as a temporary measure to increase votable supply via delegation to a targeted tokenholder group - similar to what we’ve done with the Protocol Delegation Program and proposed Chain Delegation Program. This is meant to be a short term delegation program that increases the voting power of our highest impact delegates.In exchange for receiving this delegation, Commission members will uphold the specified levels of engagement and serve the very important role of bridging communication between the Token House and Citizens’ House.The Commission will create this bridge between Houses by filing two types of reports. The Commission has no decision making power in the Citizens’ House; they may only serve as a warning system. Each report requires 4 delegate approval from Commission members to be considered valid. The Citizens’ House may, of course, choose to disregard or disagree with a report.Read the full descriptionhere.MembersBrichis (Anticapture Commission Lead)Gonna.eth (Grants Council Lead)Gene (Code of Conduct Council Representative)Blockchain @ USCButterbumCeresstationGFX LabsGriff GreenITU BlockchainJoxes (SEED Latam)Katie GarciaLefterisL2BEATsMichael Vander MeidenMinimalGravitasMoneyManDougOPUserPGovShe256StableLabweb3magnetic404 DAOInternal Operating ProceduresOn January 17th, the Anticapture Commission received a delegation of 10M OP from the Governance Fund for Season 5 and 6 contained inthis multisig."

Code of Conduct Council Communication Thread,"Voting Cycle#17- Summary of Enforcement DecisionsHello Optimists,As per the Code of Conduct Councilcharter, the Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) must publish a report of summary of enforcement actions during each voting cycle’s review period. This report in turn “will be added to the Voting Roundup and optimistically approved. In this context, optimistic approval means the Council’s decisions are assumed to be approved unless the Token House explicitly vetos an enforcement action.”So, taking this charter structure on board, this Forum Thread will act as the formal Report to summarize the enforcement actions of Voting Cycle#17, and begin a conversation with any interested members in the community here.To provide context for this cycle’s deliberations:There were no new Code of Conduct Violation Reports from the start of the new year, and through the first two weeks of Season 5.There were however three (3) legacy Code of Conduct Violation Reports that had been submitted at the latter end of 2023 that had not been handled by the Foundation (since the new Code of Conduct Council was pending at the time).Thus the CoCC was tasked with assessing, deliberating, and deciding on three (3) reports that claimed a code of conduct violation.The process is taken by the CoCC Members:All members of the CoCC were provided with raw details of the three legacy violation reports at the end of 2023.Over the new year break, individual CoCC members conducted preliminary research into the three cases.In the 2nd week of January, the CoCC met to discuss the main issues of the three cases (along with having discussions around administrative matters of the newly formed council).Post this meeting, the reports and report summaries were transferred to a shared online document where over the following week each individual CoCC member added their thoughts, opinions, and reasoning on each case to the shared document. The shared document was indeed a living document as each member’s opinion or thought led to the next member’s response.On January 16th, a final vote was taken by members of the council to finalize a decision on each of the cases. The voting was conducted electronically, with a variety of alternate actions to choose from, and a ‘first past the post’ voting system was used.NOTE: While all the processes mentioned above appear as discrete events, it’s worth noting that the council members have been in discussions on an almost daily basis since late November 2023 via a private CoCC Telegram group.None of the three cases had unanimous voting decisions, but using the voting system mentioned just prior, three resolutions were decided upon.The briefcase summaries are decisions are described below:REPORT 1:An anonymous complaint was made against@alexcutlerdotethWhile there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement in December 2023, the complainant claimed that Alex had cyberbullied community members, harassed community members, and incited others to harass them.Decision: No action to takeReasoning: The Code of Conduct Council has decided not to proceed with any sort of enforcement type related to the presented report. It has been reviewed along with the supporting documentation and has concluded this matter will not be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct, as the information presented only contains factual details of an alleged grant misusage, and is then considered whistleblowing. Whistleblowing is not considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.*Parties involved in this case should please see ‘important notes’ belowREPORT 2:An anonymous complaint was made against@0xWeston.While there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement in December 2023, the complainant claimed that Weston harassed community members, did not have a positive impact through adding value, and failed to keep the community safe.Decision: Warning (with a request to make a redeeming public apology or clarification of allegations)Reasoning: With substantial documentation to support the violation report there was a prima facie case that Weston had misused or heavily mismanaged a grant provided by Optimism. However, considering the timing of the grant and the lack of formal grant rules around this period, the CoCC found it inappropriate to issue a stronger enforcement action when it would need to be applied retroactively. Therefore, a warning from Optimism to Weston was the agreed-upon decision. Beyond this, and in the interests of inclusivity, redemption, and self-directed decentralized activities, the CoCC invites Weston to address the community on the Forum to either apologize for the poor behavior and/or otherwise acknowledge the weaknesses of the grant management while fully explaining and clarifying what happened in this case.*Parties involved in this case should please see ‘important notes’ belowREPORT 3:An anonymous complaint was made against kuso.eth.While there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement in December 2023, the complainant claimed kudo.eth engaged in discrimination based on identifying features, such as religion, sexuality, ethnicity, or geographical location.Decision: SuspensionReasoning: The CoCC believed that the reported violation was a clear and unambiguously serious violation of the Rules of Engagement and that any enforcement needed to convey the clear boundaries of what are the acceptable and not acceptable interactions within this human-driven community. While on-chain activities cannot be controlled by the CoCC or the Collective at large, a suspension from all of Optimism’s online platforms hopes to communicate how seriously the CoCC took this issue and how unequivocally it wanted to act.NOTES FOR THE COMMUNITY:This Code of Conduct Council is a new type of live experiment that the current council members are carrying out. We’ve had our teething problems, and we are the first to admit that the structures and processes do not yet meet the highest standards that each of the council members envisioned when first elected. But we can assure the community that we are doing our best to learn fast and iterate, to be open, available, and transparent with the community and all other stakeholders, and we aim to continually improve over Season 5 so we can hand over a well structured and highly functioning Code of Conduct Council to the council members of Season 6.IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PARTIES INVOLVED IN THESE CASES:A member of our council said something important in relation to these first three decisions, “(The CoCC is) setting a precedent for what the CoCC is. How we can be fast with things that are clearly violations of the rules, and careful with breaches in the social fabric? How also instead of a punitive council, we are restoring optimism from its own contributors.”This statement was quickly agreed upon by other members of the council.What is trying to be said here is that Reports 1 and 2 appear to be cases that relate more to a breach in the social fabric of Optimism, and importantly we do NOT want to be a punitive council but instead one that inspires and engenders optimism.And, thus in that vein, we don’t necessarily want to ‘close the books’ on the dispute(s) here, and just wash our hands of it. Instead, we would like to offer any of the disaffected parties here an opportunity to reach out and contact the Code of Conduct Council if you wish to discuss your situation further. The Council currently has members who are experts in conflict resolution, mediation, alternative dispute resolution, and DAO coordination. We would like to use these skills and experience to offer you a more optimal outcome, beyond the cut & dry of the Code of Conduct Council decisions. We’re happy to work with you to find the outcome to the complaint you want or ideally find happiness and satisfaction in the situation that you thought the hoped outcome would bring. So, please, if you are still unsatisfied then please reach out to us atcodeofconduct@optimism.ioWhile there will be upcoming office hours, and discussions with the CoCC here on the Forum and on Discord, our next formal report of enforcement decisions will be delivered by the end of the next review period.As the implementation of the Council is an ongoing experiment, each of us is committed to making every effort to modify and improve as deemed necessary. We will accept any critique or criticism of our process thus far and will work to amend our process to reflect our learnings.Thank you for your time,Members of the Code of Conduct Council"

Estimated time, up to 5 working days.It shouldn’t take longer than a week after a triggering fact, for the CoCC to inform the parties that a case has opened and that cooperation will be requested to advance on the next steps of the process.Were the informed party not reply within 5 working days after being reached out by the Code of Conduct Council, the Council will decide unilaterally the course of action to be taken and whether to advance to the Screening stage.No member of the board will seek to react directly to any conflict, but rather to gather the opinions of other members in order to define the next steps.2. Screening: Gathering of information. Estimated time, up to 5 working days.After a case is identified, If the violation is clear and manifest, the council can deliberate without further mapping. If the issue requires to raise more information to make an informed decision, the council will be able to decide if the following week can be a deliberation week, if the case pivots to the mediation provider, if they are ready for voting on the next steps of the case, or if it’s considered to extend the screening process up to 10 additional working days.In the event that a member commits a severe violation and immediate action is required, the COCC will suspend the member from the spaces while the screening process is complete.The COCC will maintain constant contact with the suspended member to maintain a flow of information.3. Deliberation: Estimate time, up to 5 working days.Once the screening phase is complete, an informed decision is made by consent or by simple vote in the council. This decision contains next steps on the case, including if, and what sanction applies.A decision can be made by consent when there is no objection (i.e., a warning that the decision could pose a danger to the collective) from the members.4. Follow up: 3 month period (half a season)Since the CoCC is a persistent structure in Optimism governance starting in season 6, If this follow up period happens between seasons, the previous CoCC members would have to handoff the issues and share the registry of cases to the new council, considering that members may change.After the deliberation phase, follow up is where we will review if the proposed actions were effective to deal with the situation, by having accountability on the parties responsibilities. If during the follow up period, new information arises, reconsideration can be made by the council, returning to the screening phase, for a new deliberation on the case.Definition of warnings:A warning is a response to inappropriate behavior that has the intention to prevent scaling of conflicts. Warnings play a pedagogic and corrective role in an incremental structure of graduated sanctions.As stated in the Rules of Engagement,Rules of Engagement 2.0EnforceabilityIf possible, on a case-by-case scenario, Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms may be recommended.If you do not abide by the rules above, you will receive a warning. After two warnings, you may receive a suspension for 1 month. After that, you may receive a 3 month suspension. If you continue to violate the above rules, you may be permanently removed from all Optimism community spaces. Any violation that rises to the level of those discussed in the Guidance on Severe Violations will immediately result in a one month suspension.Additional considerationsRegistry of cases will be handled privately between the CoCC and the foundation.These Internal operating procedures can be updated twice per season after being published in the forum.Mid and season reports are expected with analysis of patterns on conflicting cases and self evaluation of the council for transparency."

The first election for Cohort A will take place duringVoting Cycle #26. All elected members will serve a 12 month term and there are no term limits.The current membership of Cohort A is:Kris Kaczor (Phoenix Labs)Layne Haber (Connext)Jon Charbonneau (DBA)Alejandro Santander (Independent, former Synthetix)Mariano Conti (Independent, former MakerDAO)Martin Tellechea (The Graph Foundation)Yoseph Ayele (Borderless Africa)The Council Lead will also be elected as part of Cohort A. The current Council Lead is:Alisha.ethMember ResponsibilitiesSecurity Council key holding participants will be responsible for developing and complying with procedures to facilitate operations. As stated in theCharter:Communication and coordination among the participants;Secure key management;Verifying and promptly enacting Optimism Governance-approved upgrades and permission changes;Notifying the other participants of, and collaborating in good faith to promptly resolve, defined emergency situations; andProving continued access to keys via periodic liveness checks, where participants must prove they can access their keys within a set time limit.Members will be supported by OP stipends, pending Operating Budget submission by the Council Lead and approval by the Token House. Operating expenses will be reimbursed by the Foundation.The Security Council legal agreement also covers participants against certain liabilities.For security purposes, details of these procedures should remain private among the Council.Lead ResponsibilitiesAs stated in theCharter, the Council Lead, meanwhile, is responsible for supporting the implementation and operationalization of the aforementioned procedures, including by:Alerting key holders of upcoming protocol upgrade or role permissioning proposals going through Governance;Managing required timelines;Scheduling, setting agendas, and hosting Council meetings and facilitating discussions;Monitoring compliance with the procedures;Onboarding new Council participants; andCommunicating with external stakeholders, including Optimism Governance, as to Council operations. All Security Council participants are expected to perform these responsibilities with the awareness that OP Chains, the OP Stack, the developing Superchain, and the associated products, tools, and documentation are in a rapidly evolving nascent state. To the extent that unforeseeable circumstances or ambiguities arise (including in connection with potential responses to Exception Events), the participants will work in good faith to resolve them consistent with theCharterand theLaw of Chains.In line with standard Council processes, the Lead will submit an Operating Budget to the Token House to request OP stipends from the Governance Fund.Note:  the Council Lead is not a key holder.Finally, all Security Council participants are all subject to removal via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in theOperating Manual.Nomination ProcessAnyone meeting the eligibility criteria outlined below may self-nominate to join Cohort A (including existing members) by completing the requirednomination templateand posting to thenomination threadby August 14th at 19:00 GMT.8 delegate approvalsfrom the top 100 delegates will be required by August 19th at 19:00 GMT for any nomination to move to a vote. There is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may serve.Top 100 delegates may provide approval by pasting the below language as a comment under a candidate’s nomination:”I am an Optimism delegate [link to yourdelegate commitment] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.""Eligibility ConsiderationsParticipants on the Security Council may be either individuals or entities.Entity requirements:Active and offers a service that benefits the blockchain communityOperating for at least one year with sufficient runway to continue for at least one yearAll participants on the Security Council, whether individuals or entities, should be selected in accordance with the following criteria:Reputation.Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.Technical competency.Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key management and signing standards.Additionally, candidates may be asked to sign into the OP Atlas app, connect GitHub, verify their wallet and calculate an expertise score. There is no minimum requirement for an expertise score, but it can serve as an indicator to help delegates evaluate a candidate’s technical expertise.Alignment.Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance of their role. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Optimism competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects or self-dealing, etc. There should be no more than 3 members serving on other Security Councils.Ability to participate.A candidate’s willingness and ability to actively participate and fulfil the member responsibilities, dedicating an average of approximately 5 active hours per month hours per month, should be considered.

Approval voting is set up such that delegates can place a vote for any number of nominees with their full voting power. In the case of approval/ranked choice votes, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions.Once elected, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening process before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and sanctions screening, and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract, which will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation. If a candidate fails the screen after being elected, the next qualified runner up to pass the screening may take their place.Newly elected members that pass the Foundation’s screen will begin their 12 month term on February 9th.Removal of Council membersAll members are subject to removal via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual. A valid Representative Removal proposal related to a Security Council member must be posted to the forum and must receive 8 delegate approvals (which is higher than the default for this proposal type) to initiate a Token House vote in the next nearest voting cycle (a delay of 3 weeks maximum).The Security Council or Foundation can also act unilaterally to remove a participant who fails to satisfy the requirements of the Charter if such failure falls within the defined scope of emergency powers.In either of the above removal scenarios, an election for a removed member’s replacement should occur in the same, or next nearest, voting cycle as the removal. The Foundation will maintain a shortlist of strong candidates that are interested in joining the Council and could be nominated quickly, subject to the eligibility requirements, if need be.There is no emergency replacement procedure as the required signing threshold is automatically lowered in the case a liveness check or emergency removal by the Security Council or Foundation.Key Dates for Candidates- Now through August 14th at 19:00 GMT:Post your nomination to thisthreadusing thistemplate- Before August 19th at 19:00 GMT:Nominations must receive 8 Top 100 delegate approvals to be considered valid- Tuesday, August 20th at 2pm EST / 6pm GMT:Approved candidates should join the town hall- August 22nd - August 28th:Security Council Cohort A Lead elections take place atvote.optimism.io-August 26th - September 1st:Security Council Cohort A Member elections take place atvote.optimism.io- In the meantime:Candidates must pass Foundation screening and complete rehearsals- February:12 month term begins for the new Cohort A!"

Security Council Nomination: Remco Bloemen from Worldcoin Foundation,"Please indicate if you are running to be the Council Lead or a Council Member:Council Member.Does this nomination represent an individual or organization:On behalf ofWorldcoin Foundation.Candidate country of residence (or, if an entity, incorporation and principle place of business):Cayman IslandsHave you previously served on Optimism’s Security Council:No.Have you previously served on any other Council or Board in the Collective:No.Are you a representative of OP Labs:No, I am not.Are you a representative of another OP Chain:Yes, World Chain.If you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate profile:I am not a delegate.If you are a member of the Citizens’ House, please link to your most recent attestation here:I am not.Outline of Contributions to the Optimism EcosystemI have primarily focused on enhancing privacy-preserving identity solutions, critical for decentralized governance and security within the Optimism ecosystem. My work at the Worldcoin Foundation includes integrating advanced cryptographic protocols, improving identity verification without compromising user privacy, for World ID.One of the key contributions was collaborating with Optimism and Ethereum’s technical teams to implement the KZG ceremony that was needed for EIP-4844. I also contributed ruint, the arithmetic library that Reth (and hence op-reth and sp1-reth) uses for the 256-bit EVM virtual machine.Non-Optimism Experience:I bring significant experience in cryptography, blockchain, and decentralized systems to this role. My career includes significant contributions to several key projects in the blockchain space, where I have focused on privacy and scalability. At Worldcoin Foundation, I lead efforts to develop scalable, privacy-preserving technologies that address some of the most pressing challenges in decentralized identity. My contributions include the first open source compatible Stark prover, the Hubble L2 node implementation, EIP-712, and the gas optimized EVM assembly implementations of muldiv, exp and log used by many prominent projects.Technical Background:My GitHub handle is@recmoand I write technical notes on2π.com. I love to learn and dive into complex new subjects, which has given me experience in compilers, cryptography, databases, numerical algorithms, and many programming languages, including C++, Rust, Go, Python, Solidity, and EVM/x86/Aarch64 assembly. My current interests lie in cryptographic protocols, privacy-preserving technologies, and scalable decentralized systems. I have a strong focus on designing and implementing solutions that maintain the balance between security, scalability, and user privacy.I graduated from Sir Stephen Hawking’s theoretical physics department at Cambridge University, Business Administration at the University of Twente and the GSP of Singularity University at NASA Ames. Since then I’ve co-founded a cybersecurity company, a blockchain company, and joined 0x project early.Experience with Relevant Member (or Lead) Requirements:At Worldcoin Foundation, I regularly collaborate with various stakeholders in the Web3 ecosystem, including security experts, protocol developers, and governance bodies. This experience has taught me the importance of transparency, collaboration, and open communication when making complex governance decisions.I am particularly focused on integrating feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders, ensuring that our solutions meet the needs of the broader community while adhering to the highest standards of security and privacy.Philosophy on What Makes a Good Security Council Member:A good Security Council member should have a deep understanding of all technical matters involved and the project’s commitments. They should be able to independently judge the effects of operations on complex technical systems. An independent curious mind experienced in adversarial thinking is critical here.During normal operation they should strike the right balance between strict adherence to process and expediency. During emergencies they should be responsive, communicative and make decisions with exceptional judgment of technical matters and a strong moral understanding of the project’s goals and expectations. They should remain effective when faced with partial information and dilemma’s.Anticipated Conflicts of Interest:I will act in the best interest of the Collective, but I want to acknowledge that Worldcoin Foundation is deeply involved in privacy-preserving identity solutions, which may be deployed in other ecosystems that could have competing interests with Optimism.Understanding of Removal and Election Processes:I understand that I may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual, and that election is subject to a successful Foundation screen, which may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract.Commitment to Responsibilities:Yes, I am able to commit ~5 active hours per month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities, with an understanding of the “on-call” aspect of this role."

Before that,Unipigwas one of the earliest proof of concepts in Ethereum application scaling.Uniswap is one of the most used applications across all Superchain L2s (here) as well as the most popular DEX on Optimism with 60%+ market share (here).In addition to the scale and positive impact of Uniswap stemming from our deployment on multiple Superchain L2s, the Uniswap Foundation (”UF”), along with many Uniswap community members, have made additional positive contributions to the community, including:With the OP Grant to Uniswap early 2023, the UF alongside Uniswap community members were able to successfully deploy 3 Liquidity Mining campaigns for relatively sticky liquidity on major OP pools working with delegates from both the Optimism and Uniswap governance communities.The work done by Uniswap community members, Uniswap Labs, and Across onERC-7683focuses on establishing standards for crosschain intent fulfillment, which greatly reduces the interop friction for any dapp users needing users to bridge assets or fill transactions across chains.The UF recently co-sponsored a proposal with Whetstone Research to introduce new fee tiers on Base in order to provide more competitive pricing to swappers (here). If successful, the insights gathered will be informative and we may expand these fee tiers to other Superchain L2s.Please demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:Our team has helped to grow the Uniswap governance community over the past two years, building strong working relationships with a large number of delegates from a wide range of organizations, recently hosting 40 delegates at a governance-specific workshop called Govswap the day before EthCC in Brussels. Working with these members of the community, we have seen the UF’s participation as a major stakeholder in Uniswap governance proposals (delegating votes to post a proposal or posting it ourselves) drop from ~60% in 2023 to ~25% so far in 2024.  We have an acute appreciation for the human and technical intricacies of various governance processes, and will act as good stewards in this role’s “oracle” responsibilities.Elsewhere, we have recently taken a more active role in developing and auditing smart contracts for use by the Uniswap ecosystem, including Uniswap v4, where a team member is a leading contributor to theperiphery repoand is intimately involved in the audit process, and Unistaker, where we managed mechanism design, contract development, and the security audit process.Please elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle (this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to your nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):Chirag Narangwas most recently VP of Product at Dapper Labs, where he was responsible for Flow’s strategic direction and execution across core protocol, smart contract language, and developer experience, managing a team of 50 Engineers and 6 PMs.Erin Koenspent two years (2020-2022) as a full-stack engineer at Avantgarde Finance, working on the Enzyme asset management app and its supporting infrastructure. He subsequently helped to start Avantgarde’s asset management business, managing the development of custom smart contracts to enable jurisdictionally compliant flows of funds into onchain investment vehicles.The UF’s Github can be foundhere.Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:As describedhere, the primary requirements of a member of the Optimism Security Council are to be available and communicate well under pressure, thoughtfully execute protocol upgrades and other proposals approved by Optimism Governance, and the manage private keys securely.The UF is well-suited to satisfy these requirements. We regularly coordinate between members of not only the Uniswap Protocol ecosystem but also across other DeFi and chain ecosystems. We have also helped to manage the execution and implementation of technical projects including smart contract and app development, security audits, and governance votes. We maintain close working relationships with stakeholders of all stripes and pride ourselves on being thorough and responsive.Further, we have managed the creation and execution of numerous onchain votes for the Uniswap Protocol since our founding two years ago and stay informed regarding those votes in which we are not principal participants. This experience can easily translate into prompt, safe execution of Optimism Governance-approved actions.Finally, our team manages onchain accounts to administer our UNI treasury as well as a portion of our grants budget. The signers on those accounts have developed and maintained protocols for transaction hygiene as well as key management.Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:Coming from the Uniswap ecosystem, we understand that security is paramount to the longterm success of protocols. Often times security only becomes a focus after a crisis, but we believe that best practices for proactive security is how we maintain operational excellence as Council members. This is manifested in Uniswap through consistent audits and reviews to help establish frameworks for best understanding risks as we did with theCrosschain Bridge Assessment report.While we can do everything to protect against security risks, unfortunately we must also plan for worst case scenarios. This involves war rooming at any hour, constant and transparent communications, as well as the technical competency to participate in recovery. Although we have been fortunate as a protocol, it comes with hard work behind the scenes and working with trusted partners across the ecosystem. Our philosophy here is to maintain this level of operational and technical excellence, while continuing to uphold the highest standards of communication and integrity.Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:n/aPlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual:ConfirmedPlease verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen whichmay include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:Yes.Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

This typically involves a defense-in-depth strategy, thinking through potential threat vectors from a holistic view, in which the human is typically the weakest link. I’ve studied this theoretically as an academic, publishing papers at security conferences. I’ve handled this in practice during my time running engineering teams. And I look forward to applying these diverse experiences to keep Optimism humming smoothly. In my opinion, good visibility and strong proactive communication are table stakes. No system is perfect, and we should expect occasional failures. A good defense-in-depth strategy allows us to mitigate the downsides of failures, giving us the room to diagnose systemic issues. When I led post-mortems in the past, we held them with a no-fault ethos, recognizing that the system must design for human fallibility.Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:N/APlease verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in theOperating Manual:I understandPlease verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen whichmay include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:[No/Yes]YesPlease verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

Solution to improve DAO governance process,"1. Motivation:I believe Optimism is very serious about the its Governance Process and involving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work has go into this document (Optimism Governance Process)I’m a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the implementation of Optimism’s governance process without any changes to the current setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions instead of getting lost in tech stuff.2. Problem Now:I see 3 existing problems in implementing Optimism governance process:The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance process to avoid making mistakes.The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as Discord, Forum,… for each step of the process.Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its current setup and adopt a new one.3.How We Solve It:Syncvote provides a chrome extension. It works as a unified front-end for any DAO member that wants to make a proposal to Optimism. It acts like a central hub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and handle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages – all in one interface.Why Syncvote will fit nicely into the current Optimism practice:Non-invasive, there isn’t any new platform to familiarize with, just open the extension and click “start new proposal” to start.The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don’t need to make any changes to your current setup.It’s free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely on-chain, so until Optimism decides to write data on-chain; it won’t cost you anything.My co-founder’s created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO:Syncvote Demo4. Next Steps to Implement:To implement this transformative solution for Optimism we propose the following steps:After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the Governance Process into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.After that, Optimism will start announcing to community members on forum, announcement channels on discord and twitter… that they can start using Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.In conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to smooth governance experience for Optimism community members. I would be grateful if Optimism adopts Syncvote.Thank you for reading my post. I would like to have your feedback on this topic."
Governor Update Proposal #3: Enable onchain treasury execution,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company focused on contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend atvote.optimism.io. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This update to the governance smart contract of the token house will allow allow the execution of token transfer proposals onchain directly. Whereas today, proposals on Optimism are voted onchain, but executed manually by the Optimism Foundation according to the outcome of the vote, this upgrade will make it such that for OP token transfer proposals are executed fully onchain, automatically, and without relying on the Foundation.Note that for non-treasury token transfer proposals (such as protocol and governance upgrades) execution will continue to be conducted the by OP Foundation as before.As part of this update, we’re also introducing minor patches that address findings from aprevious audit.If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to the new implementation specified below.MotivationOnchain Execution of treasury transfers moves us along the path towards progressive decentralization, in line with the strategy outlined in theWorking Constitutionand theLong-term Onchain Governance Architecture.With this proposal, we’re incredibly excited to take the first of a series of steps towards decentralization.SpecificationsContract ChangedOptimism governorTheOptimism Governorwould be changed as part of this upgrade.

Season 6: Standard Rollup Charter Ratification,"Season 6: Standard Rollup Charter// This draft will be ratified by the Token House in Voting Cycle#29. For more context on the Blockspace Charter Framework, seehere.IntroductionThe Standard Rollup is the Optimism Collective’s flagship, high-security blockspace product. The Standard Rollup targets the Collective’s highest bar for security, uptime, and decentralization.This Charter applies the principles of theLaw of Chainsto the specific context of Standard Rollups, and does not modify or supersede the Law of Chains in any way.  All conflicts between this Charter and the provisions of Law of Chains will be resolved in favor of the Law of Chains.Optimism Governance is responsible for upholding the standards and policies outlined in this Charter and ensuring their consistency with the Law of Chains.  All potential changes to the Standard Rollup should be treated with careful consideration by the governance community, to enable long-term, sustainable ecosystems to be built around Standard Rollup blockspace with confidence.CriteriaThe criteria for being a Standard Rollup consist of:A set of deterministiconchain criteriato ensure that chains are well-configured, on an up-to-date version, and have authorized the Optimism Security Council to perform upgrades.A set of lightweight,offchain criteriachecked by the Optimism Foundation, which are expected to carry on until they are ready to be safely transitioned to Optimism Governance.Completion of a “history integrity check” by the Optimism Foundation, which is expected to be deprecated in the future (as chains deploy directly as Standard Rollups from day 1).Onchain CriteriaThe onchain criteria for Standard Rollups consist of two components: aversion checkand aconfiguration check.Version ValidationThe most important onchain criteria is that a chain be on a standard, governance-approved release of the OP Stack. This check is performed by comparing all bytecode for the chain’s L1 smart contracts to the standard bytecode corresponding to a governance-approved release of the OP Stack.Version validation is a strict, critical requirement. To securely hand over upgradability to the Collective, a chain’s L1 smart contracts must match the release tags defined bythis TOML filein the Superchain Registry. At the time of writing, this corresponds toop-contracts@v1.6.0.For those interested, the code currently used in the Superchain Registry to perform version (and configuration) checks can be foundhere. The Optimism Foundation may, from time to time, update this code (e.g. for quality-of-life improvements or other refactors),so long as it does not violate the semantic interpretation of the above TOML files, which are subject to Governance approval.Configuration CheckBeyond being on a standard version of the OP Stack, all configuration values for the chain must be within high-security, well-tested bounds, and all administrative roles must be  set correctly. There are two main components:Parameter Configuration: A set of requirements for the “protocol parameters” of a chain — things like block time, gas metering, and other low-level variables — to either equal a certain value, or fall within a specified range. The specific requirements can be foundhere.Role Configuration: A set of requirements for the privileged administrative roles for the chain. The specific requirements can be foundhere. Primarily, these checks involve ensuring that the Security Council holds authorization to perform upgrades, and other minor Stage 1 requirements (seehere).A more human-readable breakdown of these requirements, including supporting rationale choices, can be found in theconfigurability pageof the OP Stack docs. However, the ultimate source of truth for configuration requirements are the two TOML files linked above, as modified from time to time by Optimism Governance.The Optimism Foundation may, from time to time, update thevalidation codeused in the Superchain Registry to perform these checks,so long as it does not violate the semantic interpretation of the above TOML files, which are subject to Governance approval.Role Configuration ExceptionsCertain chains’L1ProxyAdminrole shall satisfy the Standard Rollup Criteria, without the default address0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A, so long as that role is a 3/3 gnosis SAFE between the Chain Governor, Optimism Foundation, and Security Council. These chains are:BaseUnichainThese Chain Governors have publicly committed to using their upgrade key consistent with the “Normal Operation” and “Emergency Response” sections of the Security Council Charter.While not currently anticipated, the Optimism Foundation may propose expansions of this list from time to time, subject to governance approval via the Protocol Upgrade process.Offchain CriteriaIn addition to the above deterministic criteria, the Optimism Foundation may perform a limited set of manual, offchain checks at its discretion before inclusion as a Standard Rollup. These checks include:ChainID check: ensuring that the Chain ID is unique and does not collide with a pre-existing EVM chain.Gas Limit check: ensuring that the Chain’s initial GasLimit is configured to a reasonable value based on the then-current status of OP Stack performance testing. (See below for additional context on Gas Limit policy.)Security Monitoring: ensuring certain standard monitoring tools have been deployed for every chain.Governor/Servicer verification: verifying at the social layer that the chain is indeed deployed and operated by the parties in question, and are not being impersonated.Other checks: running other checks (e.g. compliance-related checks) as deemed appropriate.Given the fundamentally subjective nature of these checks, they are expected to be administered by the Foundation until they can be safely transitioned to Governance.History Integrity ChecksThe Optimism Foundation has implemented a suite of history integrity checks, which can be used to identify historical discrepancies between chains and manually assess their impact. The Optimism Foundation will assess these discrepancies on an as-needed basis. If it believes that these discrepancies risk violating the Law of Chains (e.g., User Protections) in the future once the chain is added as a Standard Rollup, it will deny the chain’s inclusion, even if all other criteria in this document are met.The importance of history integrity checks should quickly diminish over time towards deprecation, since the expectation is that all Standard Rollups launched after the ratification of this Charter are deployed correctly at launch.For more information on the motivation for history integrity checks, seethis post.Note on Superchain RegistryThe ""promotion” of a chain (i.e. setting itssuperchain_levelto1) in thesuperchain-registryrepo will be the canonical indicator of passing the offchain criteria and history integrity checks. Thus, the community can determine whether a given chain falls under the scope of this Charter by checking that:The Chain passes all Onchain Criteria checksThe Chain has been included by the Foundation in thesuperchain-registryrepo.Even after history integrity checks are deprecated, it should be expected that the Foundation’s subjective checks are also either eliminated, or transitioned to a process run directly by the community, so that inclusion may be determined purely by onchain data.Governing PoliciesThe Standard Rollup’s governing policies implement additional “reactive” procedures in the event that one or more stakeholder protections in the Law of Chains are violated in such a way that the protocol cannot naturally handle them. Each of these governing policies include reference to a specific protection in the Law of Chains.As such, these governing policies are applications of the existing principles of the Law of Chains. Subject to the provisions of the Law of Chains, these policies are intended to establish predictable enforcement paths for an illustrative (but not exhaustive) list of potential violations of that document.In its current form, all governing policies’ relevant enforcement actions would be taken by theL1ProxyAdminrole, which is held by the Phase 0 Security Council, a 2/2 shared by the Foundation and the Optimism Governance-approved Council (or in the case of the chains listed in “Onchain Criteria–Role Configuration Exceptions” above, a 3/3 with the Phase 0 Council plus the Chain Governor). As such, all enforcement actions are expected to follow the standard Protocol Upgrade vote procedure, which is the existing path used for governance to exercise theL1ProxyAdminrole. In the future, policies may include different enforcement mechanisms (e.g. via unilateral action by other councils, or via direct onchain governor outcomes given explicit authority in the protocol.)Governor Key RecoveryIn the current version of the OP Stack, theSystemConfigOwneris permitted to change certain chain configuration values. According to the Law of Chains, control of some of these values are afforded to the Chain Governor (e.g. transaction fee margin), and others are afforded to the Chain Servicer (e.g. the batcher hotkey).For convenience, the Configuration Check in the above criteria permits either the Chain Servicer or the Chain Governor to be theSystemConfigOwner, so that Chain Governors can delegate all configuration updates to Servicers. However, because the Chain Governor is also protected by the Law of Chains tobe able to switch between Chain Servicers, ultimate control of theSystemConfigOwnerrole should belong to the Chain Governor.In the event that a Chain Servicer stops fulfilling the wishes of the Chain Governor for those values which the Law of Chains states they should be able to control, or refuses to transfer control of theSystemConfigOwnerrole in the event that the Chain Governor desires to switch to a different servicer, then the Chain Governor may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to have the Security Council recover the role to an account they control.Sequencer CensorshipIn the event that a sequencer is determined to be maliciously censoring valid user transactions, or experiencing unreasonable downtime impacting applications on the chain, they are violating the User Protection ofSecurity, Uptime, and Livenessin the Law of Chains.In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer in reaction (after it has clearly been put on notice of the violation), the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand appoint a new non-censoring sequencer.Responsible GasLimitsThe OP Stack is rapidly evolving and the boundaries of its performance continue to be pushed. As such, the protocol currently does not implement a hardcoded upper bound on the Gas Limit for a chain. However, this ability must be responsibly exercised to ensurefulfillment of User Protections. Thus:Before any GasLimit increase, Chain Governors should submit to the community a public load test which demonstrates stability at that limit.After any GasLimit increase, if the chain experiences a significant degradation in performance or stability, the GasLimit should promptly be lowered back to its previous value.If a Chain Governor fails to take these steps, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand lower the GasLimit.Responsible Batch SubmissionThe current version of the OP Stack allows for batches to be submitted with up to a 12 hour delay after initial reception by the sequencer (the “sequencing window”). However, Sequencers are expected to submit at least twice as frequently (i.e. every 6 hours). This affords sufficient time to batch submit in the case of failures or downtime, fulfilling the User Protection toSecurity, Uptime, and Liveness.In the event that a Chain Governor refuses (after it has clearly been put on notice of the violation) to change its sequencer which repeatedly and intentionally violates this practice, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand appoint a new compliant sequencer.Fee MarginsThe Law of Chains affords Chain Governors the ability to set fee margins for the chain. However, setting the fee margin significantly high can be a form of economic censorship — by making transactions prohibitively expensive to submit, the Governor couldeffectively violate the User Protection to censorship resistance.The Standard Rollup should allow a maximum fee margin of 100% (i.e., the average cost of transactions should not exceed twice the cost of batch submission). If a Chain Governor sets the fee margin in excess of this, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand lower the Fee Margin.ResourceMeteringTheSystemConfigOwnerrole is currently able to modify theResourceMeteringstruct, a low-level set of values which set certain properties of L1→L2 message rules. This is a low-level variable with no reason to be changed outside of a protocol upgrade.If aSystemConfigOwner(either Servicer or Governor) changes this value, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the relevant party and revert the change.PrecommitmentsThis section commits to anticipated changes (or lack thereof) for future upgrades to this Charter.  While by no means an exhaustive description of the Standard Rollup’s full future development path, the following commitments are core to the expectations of existing and future Superchain ecosystem participants.  The Collective should endeavor to do everything in its power to ensure the following commitments are actualized, understanding that non-adherence will fundamentally and irrevocably undermine the legitimacy and trustworthiness of Optimism Governance.Collective Fee TakeThis Charter specifies a fee split of the greater of 1) 2.5% of transaction fee revenue and 2) 15% of chain profit (fee revenue - L1 submission cost).It is extremely important to provide stakeholders in the Collective with a reliable economic model on which they can build sustainable long-term ecosystems. By ratifying this Blockspace Charter, the Collective is signaling its precommitment toall Standard Rollupsthat it will not modify the fee split parameters outlined above until December 31, 2029 (at the earliest).This does not preclude changes or improvements to the implementation of the fee split contracts, so long as they preserve the original economic spirit. In the event that new sources of fees (or operating costs) are introduced to the protocol, the economics should be updated with minimized impact to the existing expectations and ecosystems in the Superchain.Governor/Servicer Role SeparationSome policies above (e.g. Governor Key Recovery) arise from an overloading of theSystemConfigOwnerrole to control configurability options which the Law of Chains affords separately to Governors and Servicers. In a future upgrade (or upgrades), the Collective should transition to a model which establishes independent roles for the Governors and Servicers of Standard Rollups, allowing them to modify the configuration values afforded to them independently. This change should also remove controllability of the Resource Metering Config without a protocol upgrade.Ossified GasLimitsBecause the OP Stack’s performance is rapidly improving, the onchain GasLimit criteria is bounded above by a significantly higher value (based on the limits of fault provability) than what chains in practice require for stability. The Governing Policy above reflects the fast-paced nature of gas limits today, in which chains frequently increase their gas limits to test stability. However, as the rate of change slows, the Collective should set a more realistic upper bound, which can only be changed via upgrade.Direct Fee Margin ControlsToday, the “fee margin” discussed in the relevant Governing Policy above is only indirectly influenceable via the control of multiple other configuration variables. In the future, the Collective should implement a protocol improvement which allows the margin to be set more directly, and which imposes a strict upper bound of 100%, to remove the ability to perform economic censorship even temporarily."
Updates to the Standard Rollup Charter,"//This post outlines the key changes made to the Standard Rollup Charter since the v0.1 draft’s introduction earlier this year. For an introductory post explaining how Blockspace Charters work, please seethis post. The updated version of the Standard Rollup Charter proposal can be foundhere.Since the Optimism Foundation introduced the first draft of the Standard Rollup Charter earlier this year, we have had the pleasure of iterating based on conversations with Chain Governors, real-world testing via theSuperchain Registry Beta, and overall feedback from the broader community. As we seek ratification of this Charter, we wanted to provide a standalone post to outline two of the key changes made since introduction, and provide more color on their motivations than would be appropriate in the charter itself.  These two changes are:Introduction of temporary control structures: the ability for a limited set of chains to be included as a signer on a 3/3 upgrade multisig for their chain. This measure aims to mitigate the risks posed by malicious Chain Governors while allowing for confident, incremental adoption of Optimism Governance.Moving history integrity checks to offchain tooling:in operating the Superchain Registry Beta, the Optimism Foundation uncovered significant operational overhead in programmatically identifying all historic discrepancies between legacy chains. As a result, history integrity checks have been moved to offchain tooling, to ensure a better balance between Superchain inclusivity and security.Let’s dive into both in more detail!Intermediate Control StructuresA small set of Chain Governors have expressed a strong desire for the ability to retain a blocking right over Protocol Upgrades for their specific chain, to prevent against governance or Security Council capture. This is a valid, but nuanced, request.On one hand, Optimism Governance is still evolving, and we feel that it is reasonable for chain governors entrusting the Collective to upgrade chains with large amounts of value to request some form of oversight as governance continues to mature.On the other hand, affording Chain Governors blocking rights over protocol upgrades for their specific chain poses meaningful risk. The Optimism Collective’s most crucial responsibility is to uphold the Law of Chains and its Protections when performing upgrades on behalf of its stakeholders. A malicious Chain Governor with a blocking right over protocol upgrades could, among other things:Block emergency security upgrades for their chain, resulting in loss of assets and violating the User Protection of state transition and messaging validity.Block regularly scheduled Protocol Upgrades for their chain, breaking blockspace homogeneity and violating the User Protection of Universal, Governance-approved Upgrades.As such, this updated draft of the Standard Rollup Charter includes a temporary solution intended to balance this tradeoff. In particular:A limited number of Chain Governors may be approved by Optimism Governance to have their upgrade keys held in an interim 3/3 multisig consisting of: (1) the Optimism Security Council, (2) the Optimism Foundation, and (3) the Chain Governor.These chains must be proposed by the Optimism Foundation via a Protocol Upgrade, and are subject to governance approval via the existing Protocol Upgrade Process.The initial chains, which would be subject to approval by ratification of the initial Standard Rollup Charter, are twofold: Base, and Unichain.We believe that this solution strikes a fair balance between empowering Optimism Governance and limiting the downside of malicious Chain Governors, while preserving the ability for key contributors to confidently and incrementally adopt Optimism Governance.Offchain History Integrity ChecksThe introduction of this Charter represents a transitional moment for the Superchain, and for the Collective; a unification of chains which were deployedbeforethe existence of Blockspace Charters or the Standard Rollup. As a result, it is important to consider not just the current version and configuration, but also the historic state of a chain which was deployed in the past. Historic chain management decisions can theoretically introduce future security vulnerabilities, even if the chain  passes all of the “present-day” checks listed above.To date, there have been a number of observed  discrepancies between different chains which were previously launched, including:Deployment of intermediate versions: some chains were launched via intermediate commits of the OP Stack (i.e. commits “in-between” two governance-approved releases)Temporary bugfixes, patches, and maintenance:some Chain Governors and Servicers have performed manual maintenance for purposes of security or quality-of-life, which caused short-lived deviations in their history.Inconsistent fork activation heights:some chains have activated forks at different times in their history.Predeploy inconsistency:some chains are missing certain predeployed contracts (e.g. the EAS) or have differing predeploy contracts (e.g. certain fee faults)These discrepancies may largely be reasonable, since they stem from actions taken before the clarity and specificity presented in this document. However, they vary in nature, and it is infeasible to capture them all through a constrained set of deterministic validation checks to prove that they are “safe.”As such, the Optimism Foundation has implemented a suite of history integrity checks, which can be used to identify historical discrepancies between chains and manually assess their impact. The Optimism Foundation will assess these discrepancies on an as-needed basis. If it believes that these discrepancies risk violating the Law of Chains (e.g., User Protections) in the future once the chain is added as a Standard Rollup, it will deny the chain’s inclusion, even if all other criteria in this document are met.The importance of history integrity checks should quickly diminish over time towards deprecation, since the expectation is that all Standard Rollups launched after the ratification of this Charter are deployed correctlyat launch."
Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Mofi, a protocol engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This upgrade is proposed in response to security vulnerabilities identified during a series of third-party security audits by Spearbit, Cantina, and Code4rena. None of the vulnerabilities have been exploited, and user assets are not and were never at risk. However, out of an abundance of caution, the permissioned fallback mechanism has been activated in order to avoid any potential instability while the vulnerabilities are patched. For more information on the permissioned fallback mechanism and the OP Stack’s defense-in-depth approach to Fault Proof security, see thedocumentation.The upgrade includes both a set of smart contract upgrades to fix the vulnerabilities identified in the audit as well as an L2 hardfork to improve the stability and performance of the fault proof system. In addition, we propose extending the capabilities of the Guardian and DeputyGuardian to set the anchor state for the fault proof system in order to prevent referencing invalid anchor states. Aside from implementing these fixes, the primary impact of this upgrade would be to reset user withdrawals at the planned time, similar to the initial Fault Proof upgrade.MotivationAs described in the original upgradeproposal, our rollout strategy for Fault Proofs focuses on securing the fundamental security mechanisms first, then building confidence on the correctness of the rest of the system over time. Successfully performing this strategy requires that:The fallback mechanisms are activated whenever there is a risk of a security vulnerability.Any vulnerabilities that may arise are swiftly patched.Therefore, the Foundation (via the Deputy Guardian role) activated the permissioned fallback which restricts output proposals to a trusted proposer and we at OP Labs created this proposal to resolve the vulnerabilities identified by the security audits. Note that the Guardian role is generally authorized to enforce “Safety over Liveness” in the system, meaning that it can pause and unpause withdrawals and as part of the Fault Proofs upgrade was authorized to intervene in the event that a bug would allow an invalid L2 output to be finalized.SpecificationsThe specification for the proposed changes can be found in thespecs repo. Details of the individual audit issues are enumerated in the Audit Issues section below.Technical DetailsIn the section below, we will summarize each of the audit issues we are fixing as well as the smart contracts/off-chain components affected by the upgrade. The full reports for each audit can be found here:SpearbitCantinaCode4renaNote that this upgrade only contains the most important issues (in our opinion) from each audit. We plan on addressing other, lower-severity issues in future upgrades.Audit IssuesThe table below lists all the audit issues that are fixed in this upgrade. Issue severities have been updated to match theOptimism ImmuneFi bounty. While the auditors did discover some high severity issues, no user assets were ever at risk. All of the audit issues listed below can be detected by our monitoring tooling. Had an exploit been detected, the Deputy Guardian role - which is held by the Optimism Foundation and revocable by the Security Council - would have been expected to blacklist any exploitable dispute games or activate the permissioned fallback.Note that we have updated the spec to clarify some assumptions around the Cannon VM and program. Specifically, we trust that the Go compiler will emit proper MIPS32 programs. As a result, the Cantina issues that reference problems related to invalid MIPS32 programs are considered out-of-scope and will not be fixed.Unless otherwise noted, vulnerabilities in the dispute game all occur at MAX_GAME_DEPTH and are therefore classified as medium.Issue IDSeveritySummaryCantina 3.1.1: Allocation overflow could allow for arbitrary code executionHighMmap calls did not perform memory bounds checking, which allowed memory pointers to wrap around to zero and access the entire memory of the fault proof program including the data and text sections of active MIPS programs. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the VM, effectively breaking the VM’s correctness guarantees. No PoC was given, and it is our belief that such an exploit is infeasible due to memory protections employed by the Go runtime. Nevertheless, given the potential impact of the issue we worked with the auditors to classify this as a high severity issue and deploy a fix.C4 H-01: Invalid DISPUTED_L2_BLOCK_NUMBER is passed to VMHighAn attacker can counter a valid output claim by providing a trace containing one block after the original claim. For example, if an output root is proposed for block 13, the attacker could counter using a trace that includes valid blocks up to block 14. This issue is classified as high severity since it occurs above MAX_GAME_DEPTH.Spearbit 5.1.1: PreimageOracle.loadPrecompilePreimagePart an outOfGas error in the precompile will overwrite correct preimagePartsMediumSee section below.C4 H-02: The LPP challenge period can cause malicious and freeloader claims to be uncounterable and can also cause freeloader claims to be abused to entrap honest challengersMediumThe clock extension mechanism is designed to give an honest actor time to counter freeloader claims, even though in that case they will inherit the opposing chess clock which may have very limited time remaining. Since the LPP challenge period was longer than the clock extension period, the clock extension granted in that case would not be sufficient to allow the honest actor to complete a call to step. While the overall game still resolves correctly, the challenger would lose bonds posted in attempting to counter the freeloader claim.C4 H-05: An attacker can bypass the challenge period during LPP finalizationMediumAn attacker can bypass the large preimage challenge period by calling addLeavesLPP with _finalize set to false. Since the challenge period timestamp is never set, attackers can then call squeezeLPP, thereby bypassing the challenge period and inserting invalid data into the preimage oracle.Cantina 3.3.5: Wrong implementation of sravLowThe srav instruction does not mask the 5 lower bits of rs, which is nonconformant with the MIPS specification. This could lead to undefined behavior.Cantina 3.4.2: Location of registers array in memory should be verifiedLowThe on-chain MIPS VM does not verify that the registers array is allocated right after the state struct. Validating this would make the code more defensive.Spearbit 5.2.5: Preimage proposals can be initialized multiple timesLowinitLPP() does not check if a proposal already exists. This could lead to loss of funds if a user provides the same LPP UUID multiple times.Spearbit 5.2.3: Extension period not applied correctly for next root when SPLIT_DEPTH is set to 1 or lessLowWhen SPLIT_DEPTH is set to 1, the extension period for the next root is calculated as zero which results in no extension period being applied. If SPLIT_DEPTH is set to zero, subsequent game moves will result due to an integer underflow.Spearbit 5.1.2: Invalid Ancestor Lookup Leading to Out-of-Bounds Array AccessLowAn out of bounds array access can occur when MAX_DEPTH = SPLIT_DEPTH + 1. While this is unlikely to happen in practice, we have updated the FDG constructor to require that SPLIT_DEPTH + 1 >= MAX_GAME_DEPTH.Spearbit 5.2.4: Inconsistent _partOffset check and memory boundaries in loadLocalData functionLowThe _partOffset parameter is handled inconsistently in some places within the loadLocalData function.Spearbit 5.2.6: _clockExtension and _maxClockDuration are not validated correctly in DisputeGame constructorLowIf a dispute game is initialized with a clock extension set to more than half of the max duration, move transactions during the execution trace bisection will revert since the difference between 2 * the clock extension and the game’s max duration will underflow.Notes on Spearbit 5.1.1By calling loadPrecompilePreimagePart with less gas than necessary, an attacker could produce an outOfGas error in the precompile. If there is enough gas left in the loadPrecompilePart function, a valid preimage could be overwritten with the outOfGas error itself. This would result in an incorrect game outcome.The function of the loadPrecompilePreimagePart method is to allow certain expensive precompiles - namely ecrecover, ecpairing, and kzg_point_evaluation - to be accelerated. Accelerated precompiles offload their execution to an L1 oracle. Since precompiles are implemented natively rather than via EVM opcodes, this improves Cannon’s performance and allows challengers to quickly generate traces for blocks filled with these computationally expensive calls. To address the outOfGas issue, we’re adding a minimum gas requirement to the PreimageOracle to ensure there’s enough gas to accelerate precompiles on L1.Another related issue with loadPrecompilePreimagePart is that the gas required to accelerate precompiles on L1 may be insufficient given the cost of executing them on L2. This is because the gas provided to the precompile accelerator contract on L1 can never exceed 63/64th of the gas limit on L2. This is a problem for precompiles that have a dynamic gas cost of execution. Of the accelerated precompiles, ecPairing is the only one that contains this vulnerability as its gas cost scales with its input size.To fix this problem, we are proposing an L2 hardfork to limit the maximum input size provided to the ecPairing precompile to 112687 bytes. This number is high enough to enable all known use cases of the ecPairing precompile, but low enough to enable the challenger to generate traces for larger blocks in a timely manner. While this is technically a divergence from the EVM, our on-chain data has found no calls to the ecPairing precompile with an input size over 1187 bytes. The provided limit is therefore 2 orders of magnitude larger than any known use case, which we believe is sufficiently safe.Additional FixesIn addition to the audit fixes above, we are also proposing the following additional fixes:We propose reducing the ChannelTimeout value from 200 blocks to 50. Canon has a limited amount of memory - approximately 1.1GB - and is not currently garbage collected. The longer channel timeout caused Cannon to run out of memory on OP Sepolia, and was close to the limit on mainnet. Reducing the ChannelTimeout significantly increases the amount of memory available to Cannon and reduces the risk of an OOM occurring.An ImmuneFi bounty hunter noticed that DelayedWETH’s recover function is not robust against transfers which need more than 2300 gas. We propose modifying DelayedWETH such that the owner can always recover funds regardless of how much gas is required.We have updated the Guardian and DeputyGuardian roles to have the permission to set the anchor state back to a valid game. This allows the DeputyGuardian to fix the anchor state registry in the event that a game with an invalid proposal incorrectly resolves asDEFENDER_WINS. Referencing existing game ensures the Guardian or Deputy Guardian can’t set an arbitrary anchor state - it has to be one that the fault dispute game found to be valid.All proposed contract changes can be found in the op-contracts/v1.6.0release.Impacted ComponentsThis upgrade involves both L1 smart contracts as well as the node and execution client software.The following contracts are modified as part of this upgrade:On-Chain MIPS VM:MIPS.solPreimageOracle.solDispute GameFaultDisputeGame.solPermissionedDisputeGame.solDelayedWETH.solDeputyGuardianModule.solAnchorStateRegistry.solOP Node has been updated to process the reduced ChannelTimeout. OP Geth has been updated to limit the maximum input size to ecPairing.Security ConsiderationsThese changes are all in response to vulnerabilities discovered during external security audits. No vulnerabilities were found in the fallback mechanisms, which were themselvesauditedprior to deploying Fault Proofs in June.As per theAudit Framework, the dispute game and MIPS contracts fall into the liveness/reputational risk category which do not require audits. The fallback mechanisms make any bugs simple to recover from and  pose no risk to user funds. Therefore, we have opted not to pursue a fix review for the changes made in this proposal. We propose addressing any additional issues discovered in a similar manner to the way they are being addressed here, specifically:Depending on the issues at hand, Labs recommend that the Deputy Guardian trigger the fallback or blacklist specific dispute games.Labs or (others in the core developer community) would create a governance proposal to resolve the issues.There’s quite a bit of nuance to when the fallbacks should be activated. In light of this audit, we propose adopting the following rubric to decide if/when the fallback should be activated. If an issue is costly to exploit - e.g., it requires playing the game to MAX_GAME_DETH - then we propose disclosing it immediately and using the dispute game blacklist to mitigate any attempts to exploit it. The dispute game blacklist will seize any bonds paid by an attacker, and makes attempting to exploit dispute resolution deeply unprofitable. On the other hand, if issues are not costly to exploit then we propose activating the fallback prior to disclosure. In both cases, fixes for the vulnerabilities would be proposed as a regular protocol upgrade in the nearest voting cycle.Consistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, we have not had the contents of the hardfork audited. However, OP Labs did perform a security review of these changes. Risk analysis of each L2 change is below.Limiting the size of ecPairing’s input is considered alow-riskchange. Implementation bugs would not put user assets at risk. Even though this is technically a divergence from the EVM, our data suggests that there have been no usages of the ecPairing precompile with an input size > 1152 bytes, which is far below the limit we will be imposing.Reducing the ChannelTimeout is considered alow-riskchange. Implementation bugs would not put user assets at risk.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.If this proposal is approved, node operatorsmustupgrade their node software prior to September 11th in order to avoid a chain split.As a result of triggering the fallback,all pending withdrawals will be invalidated. Users with pending withdrawals will need to re-prove them against an output proposal submitted by the permissioned proposer.This means that withdrawals initiated less than one week before the upgrade is executed will only be finalized one week after the upgrade is complete.For example, a withdrawal initiated 6 days before the upgrade would take a total of 13 days to finalize.In addition, proposals made within a week of the permissionless game being reactivated will also be invalidated.Users will be unable to provide more than 112687 bytes of input to the ecPairing precompile.Proposers (other than the trusted proposer operated by OP Labs) will be unable to propose their own outputs until the fallback is deactivated following the L1 upgrades.All client-side tooling is unaffected.Action PlanIf this vote passes, the Granite upgrade will be scheduled for execution on September 11th at 16:00:01 UTC. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked-in activation time. Granite is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit a81de910dc2fd9b2f67ee946466f2de70d62611a and op-geth at commit 0f5b9dcfd2ac66f6fd8faae526b1549721f5f392. The smart contracts release is op-contracts/v1.6.0-rc.1. The op-node and op-geth releases will be finalized if this proposal passes.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the Sepolia Superchain in coordination with Base and Conduit.The overall upgrade plan is as follows:Update the Absolute Pre-State:Prior to the hardfork activation, we will update the absolute pre-state as done in the Fjord upgrade. This ensures that the new op-program can be used with the upgraded protocol, and must be performed prior to hardfork activation. See the Fjord upgradeproposalfor more details. This upgrade is transparent to users, and no action is required.Activate the Hardfork on L2:The hardfork will activate on the L2 network at the scheduled time. Node operators must upgrade to the versions described above to avoid a chain split. Once upgraded, no further action is required.Update the L1 Smart Contracts:Finally, we will update the L1 smart contracts to new versions that contain fixes for the audit issues. This upgrade is transparent to users, and no action is required. This update will also deactivate the fallback mechanism, and revert back to permissionless proposing.The Security Council and Optimism Foundation must sign the transactions for steps 1 and 3 prior to the hardfork activation. This sequence is crucial to prevent breaking the fault proof system.Emergency CancellationThe releases above will contain a Granite activation at the above-mentioned time. If a critical security issue is found between approval and rollout, the Optimism Foundation and Security Council should coordinate an emergency cancellation. Node operators can quickly react by using the --override.granite flag on both op-node and op-geth.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the Granite network upgrade, which responds to security vulnerabilities identified by third-party auditors. This upgrade brings better security and performance to the fault proof system.Proposal Edit Changelog8/21/2024 - InAdditional Fixes- clarified the reason the Guardian and DeputyGuardian roles have extended capabilties.8/21/2024 - Added etherscan references to the newly deployed contract implementations.8/29/2024 - Fixed etherscan links to the deployed contract implementations"
Quality standard for OP Stack chains,"We believe that the Superchain has reached a level of maturity where a basic quality standard is a good next step.  An Optimism quality standard would give third parties an understandable means to trust the software of the L2/3 of the Superchain. This forum post is looking for support from the Optimism community for this idea. Even if funded, without active support from the Optimism community any quality standard would simply be an easily ignored set of documents.  But creating this standard Optimism shows maturity and the advantages to using the OP Stack.The purpose of this forum post is to test if there is interest in proceeding further.Why develop a quality standard now?Imagine the question “Which is safer, Base, Blast, Mode or OP?”  The answer should be simple, they are all safe as they are all based on the same OP Stack.  Instead, this one question drives 100 unanswered questions. How do you define safe? What version of OP Stack are they running? Is it the latest? Did they make changes on it? Did they test those changes? Should they? Why does the website and docs not address any of these questions? All of this makes the safety of the chains a question mark when it should be clear and transparent.A quality standard would answer all of these questions in a simple, clear and auditable way. It would give Superchains the incentive to do the boring but not excessive effort to prove they meet the quality standard.Broadly speaking what are the steps?Build a quality standardGet support from 3rd parties (protocols, bridges, insurance groups) that would prefer chains that use the standardHave the standard approved via an OP voteBuild a OP doc set so that Superchains understand the steps to take and how to show they are following them.Implementing the standard is optional, but if 3rd parties show advantages, the whole thing should be accepted by the chains.Update and improve the standard as time goes bySince I started DeFiSafety in 2020, I have been reviewing DeFi protocols on best practices and transparency.  So quality standards in DeFi has been my full time activity for four years.  I have found that on my own my impact is limited.  This is why active support from OP members is crucial to getting a standard accepted and in use.A quality standard for OP L2’s is low risk, low cost, achievable task that will help improve transparency and quality of the OP Superchain as it evolves.  I think it deserves consideration."
Enable Custom Gas Token on OP Stack,"1.SummaryThis proposal from BNB Chain Core Team to allows Layer 2 networks that build on OP Stack to define its own gas token independently, instead of being limited to Layer 1’s gas token.2.AbstractIn the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a transaction call can be simply represented as a tuple{from, to, value, data, gaslimit}. OP Stack has implemented a seamless cross-chain transaction call between L1 and L2 layers: A transaction call happens on the source chain and will be fully executed on the target chain. Introducing the custom gas token will fundamentally change the meaning of thevaluefield in the tuple: the different gas tokens on L1 and L2 mean that the value of gas tokens is no longer equal. By adjusting the token handling logic in the cross-chain communication layer(PortalandL2toL1MessagePasser), OP Stack can keep the semantic of cross-chain transaction calls the same, reducing the impact on other components.The fee of cross-chain transactions is influenced by custom gas tokens due to the different prices of gas tokens. By implementing a token price oracle and considering token prices for fee calculations, the system can still maintain financial balance even if the income and expenses are two distinct tokens.3.MotivationMany projects aspire to deploy their own layer2 or even layer3 solutions for various reasons:Low Transaction Fees: Scenarios like GameFi, SocialFi, and DEX platforms demand extremely cost-effective transaction fees.Customized Chain Requirements: Projects often require customized features and rapid iterations such as precompiled contracts, shorter block times, and customized Abstract Account solutions.They often want to enhance project value by issuing tokens that can serve as gas tokens on Layer 2. However, OP Stack currently lacks support for this feature. Therefore, this draft focuses on enabling custom gas tokens on the OP Stack codebase.4.Specification828×250 21.7 KBThe current OP Stack’s cross-chain communication follows a layered model comprisingapplication layerandcommunication layer.4.1 Communication LayerThe communication layer is accessible without permission. Developers can build their cross-chain applications on this communication layer, and native Token Bridge is one of the applications.The communication layer is primarily responsible for two key functions.：Implement cross chain transaction calls. This is achieved through the collaboration ofPortal,MessagePassercontracts on two chains, along withop-node. The cross chain call can be represented as{from, to, mintValue, value, data, gaslimit}, themintValuemeans the amount of minted L2 gas token when deposit to L2, thevaluemeans the the transfer amount of L2 gas token to the to account.Verification of Cross-Chain messages. In the process of L1 to L2, the op-node observes the events on L1 and includes deposit transactions into blocks, verification passes only if it can reach state consensus. The tx from L2 to L1 is verified through Merkel proofs and fraud proofs.The introduction of custom gas tokens mainly impacts the ‘value’ field in cross-chain transaction calls. To remove ambiguity about the “value” on both chains, we get two options here.4.1.1 Option1: Enhance Cross Chain Transaction CallA cross-chain transaction call can be represented as：{from, to, mintValue, Value, remoteMintValue, remoteValue, data, gaslimit}.remoteMintValueandremoteValuerefer to the amount of gas token on another chain in a cross-chain transaction. ThePortal,MessagePasserand also theEVMneed to adapt to this change to handle the remote tokens.For example, thedepositTransactionofPortalneed to chargethe _remoteValueof custom gas token in ERC20 format, the logic will be like:On the other hand, when the L2 EVM handles theDepositTx, it will require to mint the L1 gas token on L2 in ERC20 format and transfer to the target account. These happen during the EVM transaction pre-execution phase, not within smart contracts.4.1.2 Option2: Wrap Cross Chain Transaction CallFor L1 to L2 transaction calls, invokingPortalwithmsg.valueis no longer allowed, a new parameter ‘mintValue’ will be introduced. ThePortalneeds to transfer the mintValue amount of L2 custom gas token in ERC20 format frommsg.senderto itself. The previousopaqueData = abi.encodePacked(msg.value,_value,_gasLimit,_isCreation,_data)should be change toopaqueData = abi.encodePacked(‘mintValue’,_value,_gasLimit,_isCreation,_data)in thePortalcontract.For L2 to L1 transaction calls, invokingL2toL1MessagePasserwithmsg.valueis no longer allowed, a new parameter ‘callValue’ will be introduced. TheL2toL1MessagePasserneeds to transfer thecallValueamount of L1 gas token in ERC20 format frommsg.senderto itself. TheWithdrawalTransactioninL2toL1MessagePasserwill be changed from{ nonce: messageNonce(), … value: msg.value…} to { nonce: messageNonce(), … value: callValue…}4.1.3 ComparisonOption1’s framework is clearer but will require changes across multiple modules, including op-node and EVM. Option 2 is a simple and lightweight solution, however, its capability is slightly weaker than option1. Overall, the architecture of option1 is better .4.2 Application LayerTheMessengerandBridgemodules together form the entire application, enabling tokens to flow freely between two chains.Messengermanages message nonces and failure retry mechanisms.Bridgeacts as the gateway, providing user interfaces and managing token mapping relationships.The introduction of custom gas primarily impacts theBridgemodule in two aspects:interfaces changed; Introduce two new interfacesdepositGasTokenandwithdrawGasTokento reduce confusion, along with their correspondingfinalizeinterface on the other chain.the processing logic of gas tokens on both chains changed. Because the gas token is an ERC20 token on the other chain, this part should be properly handled.4.3 L1 to L2 FeeWhen a user initiates a deposit transaction on Layer 1 and specifies a gas limit, this transaction will ensure that an equivalent amount of gas limit is executed or burned on Layer 1 as a form of fee charge. This mechanism serves to prevent DoS attacks on Layer 2 through cross-chain transactions.If L2 adopts the custom gas token solution, there will be no need to charge fees by burning gas tokens on L1. When the gas limit exceeds a certain threshold, an amount ofgaslimit * L2 base feeof L2 custom gas token will be transferred from the user’s account to a treasury account in ERC20 format. In the ResourceConfig contract of L1, there are two parameters:minimumBaseFeeandmaximumBaseFee. By considering the prices of two gas tokens, setting these two parameters appropriately can makegaslimit * L2 base feeapproximately equal to the cost of executing this transaction on L2. The operator of L2 subsequently has the authority to withdraw L2 custom gas tokens from the treasury.4.4 L2 to L1 FeeWhen users send transactions on L2, they are required to pay anL1Feeto cover the costs of DA and fixed overhead. The calculation formula forL1Feeis:L1Fee = L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * FeeScalar. TheL1GasUsedis related to the length of transaction raw data and compression rate.Considering the different prices of gas tokens on two chains, a new operator will be introduced:TokenPriceRatio. The formula will be:L1GasPrice = L1GasPrice * TokenPriceRatioL1Fee = L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * FeeScalarHowever, the value ofTokenPriceRatiocannot be automatically calculated by the system; it requires an Oracle mechanism where an off-chain service feeds the price into the L2 contract. Price feeds come in different forms and algorithms, OP Stack can leave it to the maintainer of L2. Even if the price feed lags or is inaccurate, it won’t cause major financial losses, but may create an imbalance between income and expenses in a short period.4.5 Wrap Gas TokenSince the gas token is a wrapped ERC20 token on another chain, the ERC20 needs to be deployed in advance and maintained as globally unique. Typically, the gas token wrapped in L1 already exists, so all that’s required is to pre-deploy the ERC20 format contract of the L1 gas token on L2. The issue of other L2 tokens remains unchanged."
Zk fault proof for OP Stack,"Hi, We are the cryptographic team in the BNB Chain. We are constantly updating our knowledge of the latest zero-knowledge proof techniques for layer 2s and other use cases.Recently, we proposed a zero-knowledge-based solution (partially utilizing the circuit proposed by the Polygon Zero team) for opBNB fraud-proof, and we think it could also be used for OP Stack.We respectfully submit our proposals here for your consideration and feedback.As a new user, I can only upload one embeddable picture. If you want to review the full article, please kindly visitZk fault proof for opBNB - opBNB - Build N Build Forum (bnbchain.org)Background - generic VM v.s. custom circuitIn the last year, Optimism initiated aFoundation Mission Requestto develop the Op Stack Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for verifying the correctness of its fault proof program. Once implemented, this ZKP can reduce the challenge period for Optimism from 7 days to 12 hours and avoid complicated interactive challenge procedures. Optimism accepted and funded three proposals from Risc Zero, O(1) Labs, and the ETH Storage team. Each team proposes a similar approach, where the fault proof program, written in Go or Rust, is compiled into a generic instruction set such as RISCV, WASM, or MIPS. These compiled instructions are then verified for correctness using zkVMs like zkRISCV, zkWASM, or zkMIPS, which we refer to as the generic VM approach. An alternative approach involves developing a custom circuit for the fault proof program, which we believe offers better performance compared to the generalized VM method. Recently, Polygon Zero announced the development of a highly performant type1 zkEVM, which aligns with our expectations for creating a custom circuit for opBNB’s fault proof program. Therefore, we have decided to develop a proof of concept (PoC) based on Polygon Zero’s type1 zkEVM codebase to demonstrate the performance advantages compared to the generalized VM approach. The PoC involves the protocol specific to Optimism, and can be used to generate ZKP for Optimism blocks. The figure below illustrates the simple workflow of the two approaches. It is worth noting that our proposal aims not only to improve performance but also to enhance the robustness of the Optimism multi-proofs system.image844×630 58.6 KBCurrent Fault Proof OverviewBefore delving into the ZK fault proof design, Let’s quickly review the current optimism fault proof design.The offchain fault proof program consists of two parts:Derive the disputed block from the anchor L1 block hash;Execute the disputed block based on the agreed L2 state root and compare the execution result with the claimed output rootThe onchain fault dispute game works as following:The attacker and defender take turns initiating on-chain actions based on the claims submitted on-chain by their opponents until they agree on the disputed L2 block;They then repeat the above challenge process until they agree on the disputed instruction of the off-chain fault proof program, which uses the disputed L2 block as the input;Then invoke the on-chain MIPS contract to execute the disputed instruction which will determine the winnerThe above fault proof design has following disadvantages:The attacker or defender needs to send many on-chain transactions, resulting in significant gas cost;The attacker or defender is susceptible tocensorship attacks, where transactions become harder to include in the L1 chain due to congestion created by either party. To mitigate this risk, the on-chain dispute game must allocate sufficient time for each player to act, resulting in the long challenge periodArchitecture of ZK Fault ProofThe ZK solution for fault proof is designed to address the aforementioned disadvantages. The following figure illustrates the components and workflow of the ZK fault proof design.As a new user, I can only upload one embeddable picture. If you want to review the full article, please kindly visitZk fault proof for opBNB - opBNB - Build N Build Forum (bnbchain.org)Optimism Block Execution Circuit: This circuit processes L2 blocks according to the Optimism state transition protocol and generates an execution proof to verify the correctness of the L2 block;Optimism Block Derivation Circuit: Derivation means deriving L2 blocks from L1 data. This circuit encodes the Optimismblock derivation logicfrom an L1 block hash and produces a derivation proof to verify the correctness of the derived L2 block;Fault Proof Circuit: This circuit encodes the ZKP verification logic to validate both the execution proof and derivation proof, and includes the consistency check logic between the public inputs of the circuits;zkFaultProofVerifier Contract: This contract resides on the L1 chain and is used to verify the correctness of the ZK fault proof, determining which party wins.The challenger monitors the L2 output root proposed on-chain by the proposer. Upon finding an invalid output root, the challenger can generate a ZK fault proof for the disputed L1 block and submit it to the zkFaultProofVerifier contract. If the verification passes, the challenger wins.The ZK fault proof approach has the following advantages:Challenger only needs to submit one on-chain transaction to the L1 which greatly reduce the gas cost;Since the dispute result can be determined with just a single transaction, the challenger is less susceptible to censorship attacks. Therefore, the challenge period can be appropriately reduced to improve user experience.Our workTo demonstrate the performance advantages of the custom circuit, we quickly developed a POC based on type1 zkEVM. This POC only includes the Optimism block execution circuit, which is the most time-consuming of all the circuits mentioned above. The adoption work we have done is as follows:Changed the gas fee calculation mechanism according to Optimism/opBNB protocol;Optimism/opBNB transaction fees consist of two components: the Execution Gas Fee and the L1 Data Fee. The Execution Gas Fee covers the cost of executing transactions on L2, similar to Ethereum’s gas fee. The L1 Data Fee covers the cost of publishing L2 transaction data on Ethereum. More information can be foundhereAdded the handling logic for Deposited Transaction and Deposit Receipt;Deposited Transactions are derived from L1, and included in a L2 block. There are two kinds of deposited transactions: L1 attributes deposited transaction (submits the L1 block’s attributes to the L1 Attributes Pre-deployed Contract) and User deposited transactions (transactions derived from an L1 call to the deposit contract). More information can be foundhereFix bugs in the MPT trace generation codes;Add parallelization code for transaction proof generationPerformance TestingWe conducted a performance test for the same L2 batch using the opBNB custom circuit and Zeth developed by Risc Zero. The opBNB custom circuit is more efficient than the generic VM approach, generating 10 times fewer ZK cycles and proving 5-6 times faster than zeth. This makes the opBNB approach 5-6 times cheaper.The tables below show the configuration and performance data for both.Configurations for opBNB custom circuit and Zeth:ZethopBNB custom circuitMachineg6.xlarge (GPU)m6i.32xlarge (CPU)Sever cost1 Year reserved: $0.5239/hour1 Year reserved: $4.064/hourSegment2^20No continuations mechanism yetCode commitGitHub - risc0/zeth at 5b1f4c52f6248e2fd1c9a6af49ac19532ac38ea7Commits · bnb-chain/zk_evm · GitHubBatch information used in opBNB custom circuit and ZethOp headOp blocks in epochOp transactions in epochOp gas in epoch1139639036433131828611402022566617593272114165247670763547071142234886763236663511454726963534833946114354386647329646801144534406434270595411451164363826039828Zeth generic vm approach and opBNB custom circuit performance data:As a new user, I can only upload one embeddable picture. If you want to review the full article, please kindly visitZk fault proof for opBNB - opBNB - Build N Build Forum (bnbchain.org)Based on the performance tables above, we can draw the following conclusions:From the perspective of ZK cycles, the opBNB custom circuit is more efficient than the generic VM approach. For the same batch, the number of ZK cycles generated by the generic VM method is 10 times that of the type1 zkEVM;From the perspective of proving time, when we consider the fixed server costs for the opBNB custom circuit and zeth, the opBNB is 5-6 times faster than zeth;Similarly, when considering generating ZKPs within the same time window, we can conclude that the opBNB custom circuit approach is 5-6 times cheaper than zeth based on the generic VM approach.There are some batches(113963903, 114223488, 114511643) where the performance of the opBNB custom circuit doesn’t meet expectations.Future workThe type1 zkEVM is currently in development, with features like continuations designed to make proof generation more parallel-friendly. Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance the performance of the backend proving system. The opBNB team can contribute to these planned improvements. We believe that the performance of the opBNB custom circuit approach will significantly improve as the performance of the type 1 zkEVM continues to advance.To achieve a complete ZK fault proof for Optimism or opBNB, we need to implement all the components such as the block derivation circuit, fault proof circuit, and the on-chain zkFaultProofVerifier contract. These will be important tasks for the next phase of our PoC.Once the development of the opBNB custom circuit design is complete, the opBNB team will contribute this work to the Optimism ecosystem to enhance the security and performance of the multi-proof system."

Upgrade Proposal #9: Fjord Network Upgrade,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Roberto, an engineer at Coinbase working on the Base blockchain, and a core developer of the OP Stack. I reviewed this proposal in collaboration with Sebastian Stammler and Dragan Zurzin from the OP labs team.Neither Coinbase nor I represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.This is a proposal for the Fjord network upgrade, which includes the EIP-7212 precompile to reduce gas costs of many smart wallet applications, supports Brotli batch compression for ~5-15% lower data availability costs, and improves the robustness of L1 data pricing. The upgrade also increases and hardcodes the max-sequencer-drift parameter, giving chain operators more time to respond to L1 node issues without facing a potential L2 chain halt.SpecificationsTechnical SpecificationWe propose the Fjord network upgrade (spec overview), which activates:RIP-7212: Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support (spec)Brotli as a channel compression option (spec)FastLZ based L1 data availability cost calculation (spec), including an upgradedGasPriceOracleL2 predeploy to compute it (spec).Parameter changes:Max sequencer drift becomes a constant with value increased to 1800 seconds (spec)Increased values forMAX_RLP_BYTES_PER_CHANNELandMAX_CHANNEL_BANK_SIZE(spec)The Fjord hardfork activation block, which includes several transactions to perform all L2 contract deployments, upgrades, enablements, and proxy updates. (spec)The upgrade also updates and deprecates:getL1GasUsedmethod of theGasPriceOraclecontract (spec)L1GasUsedfield of the transaction receipt (spec)Security ConsiderationsConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, we did not have the contents of Fjord audited; however, Coinbase and OP Labs engineers did perform a security review of these changes.The Fjord upgrade’s inclusion of EIP-7212 involves use of the reference implementation that is already live on other blockchains, which we consider low risk.Brotli compression is also a low-risk change since it is already used by other L2s and was evaluated for both its runtime performance and compression improvements across four different OP-stack chains. It’s usage is also optional and must be activated by the chain operator after the upgrade in order to be applied.The introduction of the new L1 data fee cost function required updates to the GasPriceOracle L2 predeploy, and changes op-geth to compute the fee values. The contract extension allows developers to continue using the GasPriceOracle to compute the data fee, and affects only helper functions that are outside of consensus.  We extensively evaluated the accuracy of this new function compared to multiple variants as well as the previous one across various timeslices of OP mainnet and Base mainnet transactions (analysis repo). The new function consistently produced significant improvements in mean-squared-error and mean-absolute-error across each, and we were unable to find any instances where the new function could wildly diverge from ground truth. (We computed ground truth by putting the transaction in a simulated batch, compressing the entire batch with Brotli-10, and returning the number of bytes occupied by the transaction in the result.) Bugs in the op-geth computation might still lead to under/over payment for L1 data fees by users. Significant underpayment could result in revenue loss for the chain operator, but the system provides parameters that can be updated quickly via the SystemConfig in order to quickly compensate for such scenarios. Overall we feel this change remains low risk.Similar to the previous upgrade, Fjord uses a special upgrade block to perform the contract deployment and activation on the L2. Bugs in this code could lead to an incomplete fork with missing contracts or contract functionality expected by the upgrade, in the worst case leading to chain halt. Since this approach to automating the upgrade has been used successfully in the past, we consider this low risk.Security considerations for the parameter changes are discussed in the upgrade specificationhereandhere. These changes are also straightforward and we consider them low risk.Impact SummaryWe do not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.Bringing EIP-7212 to the OP stack will benefit applications such as smart wallets that want to support many common authentication methods (such as Apple’s FaceID) that would otherwise be too gas intensive.We evaluated Brotli compression compared to the previous compression algorithm (zlib) on 4 OP stack chains (OP mainnet, Base, Zora, and Mode) and found compression ratio improvements ranging from 5-15% under Brotli quality level 10. This will directly translate to a 5-15% reduction in L1 data availability costs, so we expect most chains will want to activate this feature immediately following the upgrade.The FastLZ based L1 data fee function will more accurately charge for L1 data usage on a per transaction basis. Previously, highly incompressible transactions might be undercharged for L1 data usage, and a large number of such transactions might lead to an inability to recover revenue without the chain operator having to take action by re-tuning fee parameters.  We expect this new function to far more accurately detect the (lack of) compressibility of each individual transaction and reduce the chance of revenue recovery drifting from its intended target.The main impact of the parameter changes is that chain operators will have more time to respond to L1 node outage issues before the L2 chain stalls (30 minutes instead of 10 minutes).Action Plan for this releaseIf this vote passes, the Fjord upgrade will be scheduled for execution on July 10th at 16:00:01 UTC. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Fjord is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commitf8143c8cbc4cc0c83922c53f17a1e47280673485and op-geth at commit7c2819836018bfe0ca07c4e4955754834ffad4e0. The op-node releasev1.7.7and op-geth releasev1.101315.2contain these changes.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the Sepolia Superchain in coordination with Base and Conduit.Fault Proofs UpdateThis is the first protocol upgrade that will activate on mainnet following the launch of Fault Proofs, which has recently been accepted bygovernance. However, its version of the op-program and Fault Dispute Game doesn’t contain the Fjord mainnet activation yet, so we need to perform an update of the Fault Proofs L1 infrastructure before the Fjord activation on mainnet. This is the first time that we need to perform this exercise.This update involves a new release of theop-program(v1.2.0) that contains the Fjord activation and generate the so-calledabsolute pre-statefor it, which is a commitment to the program and its starting state. It also requires deploying newFaultDisputeGameandPerimissionedDisputeGamecontracts to L1 Mainnet with the new op-program pre-state hash. These are deployed at addresses0xf691F8A6d908B58C534B624cF16495b491E633BAand0xc307e93a7c530a184c98eade4545a412b857b62frespectively. After the veto period has ended, we will ask the Security Council to sign transactions to update theDisputeGameFactoryto begin using these new contract implementations. This transaction has to be executedbeforethe actual Fjord activation to avoid a broken Fault Proofs system after the activation.Emergency CancellationThe optimistic mainnet releases will contain a Fjord activation at the above mentioned time. If there is a critical security issue found between approval and rollout, the Optimism Foundation and Security Council will work to coordinate an emergency cancellation.  We have included functionality for node operators to quickly react by using the--override.fjordflag on both op-node & op-geth.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the network upgrade after Ecotone titled Fjord. This network upgrade brings reduced execution fees for certain (e.g. smart wallet) applications, lower data availability costs, and more robust L1 data pricing. We expect that this upgrade will not result in any downtime and will occur on Wednesday, July 10 2024 at 16:00:01 UTC."
[FINAL] Governor Update Proposal #2: Improvements to advanced delegation allowance calculations,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend atvote.optimism.io. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This Governor upgrade introduces improvements to the Alligator allowance storage system that enabled partial delegation and sub delegation for OP voters. Since it’s launch in December of 2023, delegates using advanced delegation, especially those who received delegation using absolute and relative amounts, could have ended up with less voting power than they should have had. We identified this and other related cases where recorded votes were preventing correct calculation of voting power, which resulted in the additional tests and the logic refactor being proposed.If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade the governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.MotivationAs part ofthe v2 upgrade of the token housewe shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called “advanced delegation”, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements.This improvement builds on the real world experience of using advanced delegation and Alligator in the wild and covers scenarios that we did not capture during testing, especially situations such as:A partially delegates to B and CC partially delegates to D and EE partially delegates to FY partially delegates to W and ZZ partially delegates to A and FWithout this change, depending on how these votes were partially delegated either via absolute or relative weights, there is a chance that F’s voting power would have been less than it should have been. It’s important to note that this hasn’t happened in production, and this update to make sure it doesn’t.We identified this and other related cases where recorded votes were preventing correct calculation of voting power, which resulted in the additional tests and the logic refactor being proposed.Impact to voters:Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience especially if they find themselves in complex delegation states where some users delegated to them with relative power, and other delegated to them with absolute power.Note on timing:We’re aware that delegates were previously asked to vote on another advanced delegation upgrade proposal, so some may be wondering why these updates were not batched. The reason for this is that, due to auditor availability, we could only ship the full scope of changes several weeks after they were completed. Some of the changes included improvements to the voting experience – so we worked out a deal with the audit team to audit that part first so that voters may benefit from that change asap. This current vote is for the rest of the changes.SpecificationsContract ChangedTheOptimism Governorwould be changed as part of this upgrade. Please review the pull request here:github.com/voteagora/governorfix: allowance calculation in alligatorvoteagora:main←voteagora:alligator-allowance-fixopened05:16PM - 16 Mar 24 UTCjjranalli+664-107fixes how allowances are calculated in complex subdelegation scenarios.

the m…ain correction comes from the assumption that:
- absolute allowances are related to **all votes cast by a delegate** regardless of authority chains
- relative allowances are related to **votes cast by a delegate via a certain authority chain**

this should fix should solve most scenarios, but more tests (especially fuzz) are needed to make sure all edge cases are covered and the desired outcome is always achieved.

"[FINAL] Protocol Upgrade #8: Guardian, Security Council Threshold and L2 ProxyAdmin Ownership changes for Stage 1 Decentralization","Hi Maurelian here, I’m a protocol security engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.Executive SummaryThe protocol upgrade is intended to increase the security and decentralization of the Superchain by meeting the following requirements:Increasing the Security Council Safe’s signing threshold, from 4 to 10, out of 13 owners. This meets the 75% threshold requirement for a Stage 1 rollup outlined inL2Beat’s Stages framework.Reassigning the role of Guardian from the Foundation to a new Guardian Safe with the Security Council Safe as its sole owner. This moves the Superchain closer to satisfying the 1 weekexit windowrequirement for Stage 1.Additionally the Foundation is appointed to the new DeputyGuardian role which is able to act as Guardian through the Guardian Safe. This appointment can be revoked by the Security Council Safe at any time.Even though the appointment of the DeputyGuardian is closer to a change in configuration than version, it is a fundamental component of the Superchain’s security model and thus we are requesting governance approval (as would, we believe, any decision to use the Security Council Safe to modify the DeputyGuardian).Note that the Guardian role is generally authorized to enforce ‘Safety over Liveness’ in the system, meaning that it can currently pause and unpause withdrawals, and following the Fault Proofs upgrade will be able to intervene in the event that a bug would allow an invalid L2 output to be finalized.Reassigning the owner of the L2ProxyAdmin contract from the Foundation to the Security Council (currently in Phase 0, which is a joint 2/2 multisig between the Security Councils Safe and the Foundation Safe). This ensures the Security Council Safe has a blocking vote for L2 predeploy upgrades and is a requirement for Stage 1.If this vote passes, we recommend the upgrade be deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.SpecificationsThe full specifications for the Liveness Extension and Deputy Guardian system are availablefrom the specs repo.Technical DetailsThis upgrade does not affect the node or execution client software.The following outlines the full set of changes to the existing system:TheSecurityCouncilSafeis modified to:Increase its threshold from 4 to 10. The current owner count is 13 and will remain unchanged with this upgrade.Extend its functionality by enabling newLivenessModuleandLivenessGuardcontracts.This module and guard comprise a liveness checking mechanism intended to ensure that any loss of access to a signer’s keys is identified and addressed within a predictable period of time.The maximum time during which an owner will be considered live without having signed a transaction or else explicitly calling the guard to demonstrate liveness, will be3 months14 weeks. Should an owner not be live during that time, the Module will enable that owner to be removed without requiring a threshold of owners to sign. The duration of 14 weeks is chosen to be slightly longer than 3 months, so that liveness can be demonstrated on a regular quarterly cadence.In the unlikely event that enough owners are removed to reduce the total number of owners below 8, then the module will enable all owners to be removed and be replaced with the Foundation as the sole owner.A newGuardianSafeis deployed, which has a threshold of 1, and the Security Council Safe as its only owner.A newDeputyGuardianModuleis enabled on thisGuardianSafe. This module enables theFoundationSafeto call any of the Guardian authorized actions in theSuperchainConfigandOptimismPortalcontracts.This architecture will allow the Foundation to maintain the fast incident response system it has established, while providing the Security Council Safe with the ultimate authority to:override and reverse any Guardian actions taken by the Foundation.revoke the capacity to act as the Guardian by disabling theDeputyGuardianModule.TheSuperchainConfigcontract is upgraded with theGuardianSafein theGuardianrole (the code is unchanged).TheL2ProxyAdminOwneris set to thealiasedaddress of theL1ProxyAdminOwner, which is the Phase 0 Security Council.TheL1ProxyAdminOwner(i.e., the Phase 0 Security Council) can now sendbridging messagesfrom L1 to L2 to upgrade predeploy contracts on L2. This ensures the Security Council Safe has a blocking vote for L2 predeploy upgrades.TheL2ProxyAdminOwneris changed by callingtransferOwnership()onL2ProxyAdminwith the aliased address of the L1ProxyAdmin.These contracts are tagged in the optimism repo at commit9047beb(tagged as release candidateop-contracts/v1.5.0-rc.1).Security ConsiderationsCode SecurityConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, OP Labs had the code audited by aCantina contestwhich ended on May 10th. A Lead Security Researcher from Spearbit was also engaged to audit the system in parallel.This audit uncovered no High severity issues, however a number of improvements were identified which we elected to make in order to reduce the potential for issues resulting from human error. A draft of the report can be viewedhere. It will be finalized after the completion of judging and escalation, however OP Labs has reviewed the findings with assistance from the Cantina/Spearbit team and are confident that no High severity issues were identified.Those changes (all in theLivenessModule) are:A constructor check was removed, which enforced that the Safe’s threshold was greater than 75% of the owner count at the time of the module’s deployment. This check reduces the likelihood of the module being enabled on a misconfigured Safe, but also made the deployment and upgrade process more difficult. The check will instead be done at upgrade time, thus ensuring no loss of safety (PR here).Error message handling was modified to be more consistent with other portions of the codebase (PR here).The module will be deactivated in the event that ownership of the Security Council Safe is transferred to theFALLBACK_OWNER(the Foundation Safe). This mitigates the risk of unexpected behavior when the Safe is operating below the expected minimum number of owners (PR here).Operational SecurityWe will also establish monitoring systems for detecting events associated with the code. These systems will detect and alert on the following events:In theLivenessModuleWhen a signer on the Security Council Safe is no longer live and can be removed.When a signer is added or removed.When the fallback owner is activated.On the Security Council Safe:When either theLivenessModuleorLivenessGuardare removed or replaced.When any other module or guard is added or removed.On theDeputyGuardianModule:When any of the Guardian actions are taken using the module, including:Callingpause/unpauseon theSuperchainConfigcontract.CallingblacklistDisputeGame,setRespectedGameTypeon anOptimismPortalcontract.Proxy Admin Owner SecurityAccording to theStages framework, one of the requirements for Stage 1 is that “Users’ withdrawals cannot be censored by the permissioned operators”. This means that any vector to halt or censor users’ withdrawals OR steal users’ funds must be controlled by the Security Council.An attack vector exists whereby theL2ProxyAdminOwnercan potentially steal users’ funds by upgrading L2 predeploy contracts. The specific attack is:Upgrade theL2toL1MessagePassercontract,Insert false entries to the[sentMessages()mapping](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/maur/guardian-module/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L24),One falsified withdrawal per asset is required to access the full balance of each ERC20 (in the Bridge) or ETH (in the Portal)Withdraw ERC20s from the Bridge and ETH from the PortalTo ensure “no permissioned operators” can censor users’ withdrawals or steal users’ funds (and therefore satisfy Stage 1 requirements), theL2ProxyAdminOwneris being transferred from the Foundation Safe to the L2aliasof the Phase 0 Security Council. The Security Council Safe will now have a blocking vote on all L2 predeploy upgrades.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade. Node operators are not affected. Existing contracts retain their current interfaces in order to remain backward compatible with any existing integrations.These changes primarily affect the system of ownership and authorization, and serve to increase the decentralization of the Superchain.Action PlanIf this proposal passes a Token House vote, the L1 contracts will be upgraded following the completion of the Citizens’ House Veto Period following Voting Cycle#23a. The upgrade will be completed atomically such that all affected L1 contracts will be upgraded within a single transaction.No action is required by node operators, as this is change affects contracts only.If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, OP Labs will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.ConclusionThis upgrade moves the Superchain forward in terms of decentralization, while preserving existing incident response capabilities and providing safety against potential liveness failures."
Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first Governance,"Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first GovernanceIn Season 6 of Optimism Governance, we intend introduce theBlockspace Charter: a new, technical-focused governing document (and framework) for the Superchain. This post will serve as an introduction to Blockspace Charters, explaining what they are and what their purpose is. We will also present, and eventually seek ratification for, the first charter—theStandard Rollup Charter—in a parallel post. An initial draft of the Standard Rollup Charter for community feedback can be foundhere.The Reflection Period will be used to build understanding of the underlying concepts presented below. Ratification for the Standard Rollup Charter will occur during Season 6, and updates to the corresponding Protocol Upgrade framework will follow. In the meantime, the Foundation will conduct an AMA as part of the Token House Community Call on Tuesday, May 14 to answer any questions and collect community feedback. Followup calls may be scheduled as necessary.MotivationThe Superchain is quickly blossoming into a robust ecosystem of OP Stack-based chains. However, these chains are not all technically equivalent:Different chains may use differentversionsof the OP Stack—some projects have made modifications to the stack, and others are on outdated versions of it.Even within chains that are on the same version, some may beconfigureddifferently — that is, deployed with different values for various parameters, admin roles, and so on.Open source, permissionless innovation is key to the Collective’s success. At the same time, ecosystem fragmentation also poses challenges:Users and developers need an easy way to understand what blockspace has which properties and guarantees.Optimism Governance needs to understand how to make decisions about these different forms of blockspace, which may make different commitments and have different control structures.The Law of Chainsis a neutrality framework designed to provide a guiding light for the Superchain and its stakeholders to make decisions and uphold protections. However, the Law of Chains is intentionally agnostic to any specific details of the protocol. This allows for it to beapplicable over many iterations of the protocol, but also means that it can fail to provide clear guidance at the granularity described in the above bullets.This makes the Law of Chains analogous to theWorking Constitution of the Optimism Collective. It defines the guiding principles for the Collective’s governance, but it does not define the specific mechanisms of voting cycles, quorums, and so forth.  Blockspace Charters are the equivalent to theOperating Manual, providing the specific implementation details for different types of Superchain blockspace.What is a Blockspace Charter?At a high level, a Blockspace Charter consists of three primary components:Criteria,Governing Policies, andPrecommitments.Criteriaare the specific technical parameters which define which chains are under the scope of a given charter.  The charter’s criteria should provide anobjective definitionfor which chains are under its scope.  Generally, there are two components to blockspace criteria:Version:The version of the OP Stack which the chain is using, as determined by commit-hash/release. This refers to the specific protocol code powering the blockspace.Configuration:the accepted range of parameterizations of the software in the OP Chain’s deployment. Configuration can include static variables defined at genesis, like the Chain ID, and dynamic variables, like the chain’s sequencer or upgrade keys. Configuration bounds state what values those options must fall within to satisfy the charter’s criteria.Solvency:This involves ensuring that a chain’s history does not include any invalid withdrawals, or invalid outputs, which could cause the bride to be undercollateralized.Governing Policiesare the specific rules, procedures, and principles which stakeholders participating in the charter’s blockspace follow.Generally, Governing Policies will be related to how the differentconfigured rolesshould behave or interact, and how that isenforced.  For example, if a charter’s blockspace criteria requires that upgrade keys configured be held by the Security Council, and allows the chain’s sequencer to be configured to be anybody, then the governing policies could define:The required behavior of the sequencer, which, if violated, would be grounds for removal, and the methods by which the community can check for violations.The governance process (i.e. proposal type) by which governance could vote to remove a sequencer found in violation.The signing procedure which would be subsequently taken by the Security Council to remove the offending sequencer.As you will see in theStandard Blockspace Charter draft, governing policies should be mapped back to theLaw of Chainsguiding principles.  For each protection in the Law of Chains, the governing policies make explicit how those protections can be upheld for the charter’s blockspace.Precommitmentsserve as a commitment mechanism, outlining anticipated changes (or anticipated consistency) for future upgrades to the charter.They are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the long-term vision and stability of the governance framework. By committing to specific parameters or outlining planned evolutions of the charter, Precommitments help mitigate uncertainty and foster a stable environment for growth and innovation within the Superchain ecosystem.Precommitments can address various critical aspects of OP chains, such asfee split models,role separations, andtechnical parameterslike gas limits and fee margins.The specificity of Precommitments can vary from extremely specific anticipated changes to protocol code, to anticipated changes to Governing Policies’ enforcement procedures, to implementation-independent economic guidance or principles.How will Blockspace Charters be rolled out?Blockspace Charters will be rolled out alongside two supporting components: theSuperchain Registry, a Github repository which manages addition of new chains according to Charters’ Criteria, and animproved upgrade proposal processwhich maps upgrade proposals to a particular Charter (seehere.)Superchain RegistryTheSuperchain Registrywill play a crucial role in the Blockspace Charter framework by serving as an accessible index of what chains are a part of the Superchain. It acts as the source of truth for which chains have been accepted under a specific charter and documents the specific configuration values which have been chosen for each chain. This registry is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability within the Superchain ecosystem.The Superchain Registry implements thevalidation logicreferenced in Charters’ Criteria via an automated test suite. This ensures that all chains meet the criteria outlined in their respective Blockspace Charter before being added, ensuring consistency and security across the Superchain.As a public index, the Superchain Registry also serves asunified, accessible documentationfor what OP Chains exist, and what kind of blockspace they implement (i.e.—what charter, if any, they fall under). Note that the Superchain Registry may include different chains in the superchain which meet different charters’ criteria (or which meet no charters’ criteria). This means thatinclusion in the Superchain Registry only implies inclusion in the Superchain.The Superchain Registry implements an extensible categorization system to clearly delineate which chains fall under which criteria (and therefore which Blockspace Charter), which further implies what “part” of the Superchain it is in.Incremental Rollout (Beta Registry)While the process outlined in this document brings a great deal of clarity to Superchain governance, the Collective already votes on protocol versions independent of the chains in question. As the Security Council currently enacts all Protocol Upgrades, we do not view it as strictly necessary for the Standard Rollup Charter to be ratified before the Phase 1 Security Council becomes responsible for upgrades on additional OP Chains.Therefore, in close coordination with the Security Council and relevant Chain Governors and Servicers, we plan to roll out a “beta registry” and begin onboarding some initial chains to the Phase 1 Security Council and Superchain Registry, if we know they are on the governance-approved version of the OP Stack.  We plan to use this as an opportunity to iron out any frictions and get the Security Council comfortable with the end-to-end process, before before the charter is ratified and the process is scaled.Improved Upgrade Proposal ProcessCorresponding to Blockspace Charters being able to rigorously define specific types of blockspace, upgrade proposals will now be changed to correspond to specific charters. Together with the Superchain Registry, this will allow the Collective to clearly understand exactly which chains are in the scope of an upgrade, and rigorously consider the impact on stakeholders.The updated Upgrade Proposal template can be foundhere.  The template is relatively similar to that in previous seasons, with the difference that:Upgrade proposals now specify a Blockspace Charter to be upgraded.Upgrade proposals must link to a pull request for an updated charter. This will be the version of the charter that, if successful, applies post-upgrade.TheImpact Summarysection of the upgrade proposal now must provide:Justifications for all changes to the Blockspace Charter not covered in other sections.A comprehensive justification that all Precommitments in the previous Charter are preserved by the upgrade.This enhanced upgrade proposal process, by aligning closely with Blockspace Charters and the Superchain Registry, ensures a transparent, accountable, and stakeholder-focused approach to evolving the Superchain. It supports to goal that every upgrade is carefully considered, justified, and aligned with the long-term vision and commitments of the Optimism Collective, fostering a stable and innovative ecosystem."
Governor Update Proposal #1: Improve advanced delegation voting,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend atvote.optimism.io. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This is a 1 line update to the governance smart contract of the token house that will allow the small subset of voters who have received their voting power from advanced delegation (a feature introduced in the last governor update) to vote by signing one transaction instead of two.If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.MotivationBackground:As part ofthe v2 upgrade of the token housewe shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called “advanced delegation”, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements. One side effect of feature is that voters who received advanced delegation would need to sign two transactions to vote.When we shipped this feature, we thought having two transactions would be a good thing, to easily show users when they voted from each of their voting powers: standard delegation power and advanced delegation power.After getting feedback from a small group of ~50 voters who’ve received votes via this feature, it was clear that this was a bad idea. As a consequence, we have paused the further rollout of this feature and refactored the contract to allow for a vote with both standard and advanced delegation in one transaction.Impact to voters:Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience and will sign only 1 transaction.SpecificationsContract ChangedTheOptimism Governorwould be changed as part of this upgrade.

Upgrade Proposal #6: Multi-Chain Prep (MCP) L1,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Diego, a protocol engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This protocol upgrade strengthens the security and upgradeability of the Superchain by enabling L1 contracts to be upgraded atomically across multiple chains in a single transaction. To achieve this, this proposal transitions chain-specific deployment configuration from immutable variables into smart contract state. This allows multiple chains to point to a single smart contract implementation, which dramatically simplifies the deployment process and streamlines the upgrade process. This is particularly important for emergency upgrades, which would have previously required multiple upgrade transactions which increases the risk of exploitation in the event of a smart contract vulnerability.In addition, this upgrade extends the SystemConfig to contain the addresses of the contracts in the network. This improves developer experience by allowing users to discover the system’s contract addresses programmatically using SystemConfig.If this vote passes, we recommend the upgrade be deployed to OP Mainnet shortly after the end of the veto period. The newly-formed Security Council will be responsible for deploying this upgrade to OP Mainnet.SpecificationsContracts ChangedThe following contracts would be changed as part of this upgrade. Each contract links to the pull request where the changes were made, and the bullet points correspond to the immutable variables moved into state (in format{type} {varName}):OptimismPortalL2OutputOracle l2OracleSystemConfig systemConfigL1CrossDomainMessengerOptimismPortal portalCrossDomainMessenger otherMessengerL1StandardBridgeCrossDomainMessenger messengerStandardBridge otherBridgeL1ERC721BridgeCrossDomainMessenger messengerStandardBridge otherBridgeOptimismMintableERC20Factoryaddress bridgeL2OutputOracleuint256 submissionIntervaluint256 l2BlockTimeaddress challengeraddress proposeruint256 finalizationPeriodSecondsSystemConfigSecurity ConsiderationsConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, OP Labs had the code audited by Cantina, since the upgrade results in many changes to storage layouts, and mistakes in that process can result in loss of assets due to e.g. a reinitialization bug.The audit results only contained informational and low-severity issues. As such, we will not be modifying the contracts further in order to keep the contracts code-frozen. See the full audit reporthere. Additionally, given the low-severity nature of the issues and fixes, we decided not to pursue a fix review.Any fixes that did not require redeploying contracts have been made andmerged. Theremaining changes, which do not affect security, will be proposed as part of a future upgrade.We have also established monitoring systems for detecting events associated with initializations and upgrades of the contracts, the code of which you can findhere.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade. Node operators are not affected. Existing contracts retain their current interfaces in order to remain backward compatible with any existing integrations.The primary new functionality is the movement of variables out of immutable storage and into state. This is a change that will improve the upgradeability and incident response capacity of the Superchain.Action PlanIf approved by governance, the upgrade will be executed shortly after the veto period passes, pending coordination with the Security Council. The upgrade is code complete as of commite6ef3a900c42c8722e72c2e2314027f85d12ced5(releaseandtag) in the Optimism monorepo.This upgrade was successfully deployed toop-sepoliaon Jan 19, 2024.If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, OP Labs will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the Optimism Collective’s MCP L1 upgrade. This upgrade enables atomic, cross-chain upgrades and mitigates potential exploitation risks during emergency, multi-chain upgrades.As this is a contracts-only upgrade, no action is required by node operators."
Upgrade Proposal #5: Ecotone Network Upgrade,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Roberto, an engineer on the core Base team and a core developer of the OP Stack. Neither Coinbase nor I represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions. Blobs are a new type of data storage introduced by Dencun specifically for the purpose of rollup data availability. Blob data is priced using a separate fee market from regular transaction gas, and is purely additive to calldata (batches in Ecotone can be posted using either). We expect a dramatic (up to ~80x) reduction in overall transaction fees due to the fact that blobs increase data availability capacity to 4x of what all L2s use today. The remaining changes in this upgrade bring the core improvements from the L1 Dencun hardfork into the OP stack, including new opcodes and the beacon root support. While blob data availability requires L1 Dencun activation, the Ecotone upgrade can be activated independently of it.SpecificationsTechnical SpecificationWe propose the Ecotone network upgrade which activates:EIP-4844 Blobs for Data AvailabilityChain derivation support for transaction batches posted to the L1 as EIP-4844 blobs. (spec)A new L1 data fee pricing function to accommodate the impact of blobs on data availability cost (spec).An upgraded GasPriceOracle L2 predeploy to compute it (spec)An upgraded L1Block predeploy to process the function’s new parameters provided by an updated L1 attributes transaction (spec)DencunEIP-4788: Expose beacon chain roots through the execution layer block header and EVM. (spec)EIP-1153: Transient storage opcode support (TLOAD, TSTORE).EIP-5656: Memory copy opcode support (MCODE).EIP-6780: Self-destruct (SELFDESTRUCT) limited to the same transaction only.EIP-4844is the only Dencun execution feature not activated in Ecotone. Blob transactions are instead explicitly disabled, and the BLOBBASEFEE opcode fromEIP-7516, while activated, always returns 1. (spec)The Ecotone hardfork activation block, which includes several transactions to perform all L2 contract deployments, upgrades, enablements, and proxy updates. (spec)Security ConsiderationsConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, we did not have the contents of Ecotone audited; however Coinbase and OP Labs engineers did perform a security review of these changes.The Dencun upgrade consists of relatively standard EVM changes and the introduction of beacon block root in the block header and a beacon roots contract deployed at a special location. We consider the EVM changes low risk because they have been active on Goerli and Sepolia testnets without issue. We have also entirely disabled the new transaction type (blob transactions) introduced by EIP-4844 from being accepted by the L2 chain.While blobs are disabled in the L2, Ecotone supports posting transaction batches to the L1 using blobs. This extension affects chain derivation, adding new logic around interpreting blob transactions posted by the batcher, downloading any referenced blobs from an L1 consensus client, and processing their contents by decoding them from the blob format to the usual channel format. We consider these changes medium risk primarily because of the larger scope of the change. These changes do not affect bridging or any L1 contracts, and are therefore unlikely to introduce bugs that can be exploited to drain assets.The introduction of the new L1 data fee cost function required updates to two of the L2 predeploy contracts, GasPriceOracle and L1Block, and also changes to both op-node and op-geth to compute the fee values and propagate the appropriate fee parameters. The contract extensions were required to pass the new Blob base fee derived from L1 blocks to the L2 so that it is aware of the blob fee market, and so that developers could use the GasPriceOracle to compute the new data fee without having to roll their own implementation of the new function (details here). These changes are limited to a few short functions. Because of the overall scope of this change, we consider it medium risk. The most severe faults from these changes might be a chain halt due to a chain derivation/validation failure, or under/over payment for L1 data fees by users. Significant underpayment could result in revenue loss for the chain operator, but the system provides parameters that can be updated quickly via the SystemConfig in order to quickly compensate for such scenarios.One final potential risk is the introduction of a special Ecotone upgrade block which introduces special deposit transactions that perform the various contract deployments and upgrades on the L2. Bugs in this code could lead to an incomplete fork with missing contracts or contract functionality expected by the upgrade, in the worst case leading to chain halt. We have tested the upgrade process on several devnets and the Base and OP-goerli testnets with success, and overall consider the changes medium risk.Impact SummaryWe do not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade.Bringing Dencun to the OP Stack is important to retain compatibility with Ethereum. One Dencun change to be aware of is the new behavior of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, which may be backwards incompatible for some contracts. We expect the number of affected contracts to be small since the change has been long telegraphed by L1 developers. The beacon root feature introduced by Dencun will allow L2 contracts to validate L1 consensus data, and should support new use cases involving staking pools and re-staking.We expect the greatest impact of Ecotone to come from using blobs for transaction batching. Blobs are a new type of L1 data storage introduced by Dencun specifically for the purpose of rollup data availability. Blob data is priced using a separate fee market from regular transaction gas, and is purely additive to calldata (batches in Ecotone can be posted using either). It’s difficult to precisely estimate the impact of this feature on transaction fees since we cannot predict new use cases that might arise to consume them. Based on the data availability use case alone, however, capacity increases to 4x what all L2s are using today. While blobspace is uncongested, we expect up to ~80x reduction in fees for all OP chains as long as blobs are fully utilized. Prediction markets are currently estimating a 40x cost reduction in the short term.Blob usage is optional and configurable by the chain operator in Ecotone. Lower traffic chains may choose not to enable them since achieving maximum benefits may require far less frequent posting of data to the L1. While blob usage requires Dencun activation on the L1, Ecotone can be activated independently of it should the benefits of its other features be desired earlier.Action PlanIf this vote passes, the Ecotone upgrade will be scheduled for execution on March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC**. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Ecotone is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit f707883038d527cbf1e9f8ea513fe33255deadbc  and op-geth at commit 0402d543c3d0cff3a3d344c0f4f83809edb44f10. The op-node release v1.7.0 and op-geth release v1.101308.2 contain these changes.*In the event governance vetoes the upgrade, we will release a new version of the op-node and op-geth software with the activation date removed.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets in coordination with Base & Conduit. It successfully activated on op-goerli and base-goerli on Feb 6, with Sepolia scheduled for Feb 21.If there is a critical security issue, node operators will be able to disable the upgrade by using the --override.ecotone flag on both op-node & op-geth. Coinbase and OP Labs will also collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade is no longer happening.We will release a new version of op-node & op-geth with the mainnet Ecotone activation date baked in and publicize to node operators & end users that the Ecotone upgrade will be occurring. The mainnet ecotone activation date is scheduled for March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the network upgrade after Delta titled Ecotone. This network upgrade maintains EVM equivalence via activating the Dencun network upgrade and allows OP Stack to take advantage of L1 blob data for lower cost data availability.We expect that this upgrade will not result in any down time and will occur on March 14th.*This proposal was updated to reference op-node v1.7.0.**A previous revision proposed an upgrade date of March 18th 17:00:00 UTC."
Upgrade Proposal #4,"Hi I’m Maurelian, an engineer at OP Labs.OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem, and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.This is the fourth proposed network upgrade after Bedrock. It introduces a new L1 contract, theSuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.Executive SummaryThis protocol upgrade would not only strengthens individual chains, but leverages the collective security intelligence of the entire Superchain ecosystem. The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit856c08b(taggedas release candidateop-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).Technical SpecificationThis is a security focused upgrade. It is limited to the L1 smart contracts, and does not affect the node or execution client software.The following changes are being introduced with the upgrade:A newSuperchainConfigcontract and improvements to the pausability mechanism providing stronger protection for assets held in the bridge.See theSuperchainConfigspecificationTheOptimismPortalandL1CrossDomainMessengerare updated to fix an issue (which would only occur during an upgrade), resulting in some values being unnecessarily reset to their defaults after an upgrade.PR hereThe L1OptimismMintableERC20TokenFactoryis being updated with two improvements:Support for deploying a token with a custom number of decimals (PR hereandhere).UsingCREATE2to ensure that tokens with different properties do not have the same addresses on different OP Chains. (PRshereandhere).Security ConsiderationsThis upgrade has been audited by Trust Security, the final report can befound here.Summary of the audit findingsThe audit did not identify any security issues in the system’snewly addedfunctionality.The audit did however identify an issue in the system’s existing upgrade path. The affected contracts werefixedand upgraded on the Sepolia testnet.Importantly, the issue could only be exploited if the upgrade was performed in a specific way. In such a case, an attacker could have intercepted the upgrade transaction, to perform a one-time double withdrawal of ETH held in theL1CrossDomainMessenger. Note that this contract currently holdszero ETHat the time of writing. Under normal circumstances, the vast majority of ETH is stored in theOptimismPortal.Please see TRST-H-1 in theaudit reportfor a detailed discussion of the issue.This issue is only exploitable during an upgrade, and the upgrade scripts have been fixed, so no future upgrades will be at risk of this issue.No other findings from the audit presented a risk of a loss of assets.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade, and node operators are not affected.Existing contracts retain their current interfaces in order to remain backwards compatible with any existing integrations.The primary new functionality will be an extension of the pause mechanism, which prevents the withdrawal of assets from the system in the event that a vulnerability is identified. This will improve the incident response capacity of OP Labs.Currently only theOptimismPortal’sproveWithdrawalTransaction()andfinalizeWithdrawalTransaction()functions are pausable.Following this upgrade, this will expand to include the following additional functions:L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage()L1StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeERC20()L1StandardBridge.finalizeERC20WithdrawalL1tandardBridge.finalizeBridgeETH()L1StandardBridge.finalizeETHWithdrawalL1ERC721Bridge.finalizeBridgeERC721()Prior to the upgrade, a new proxy (at the addresshere) and implementation (at0x53c165169401764778f780a69701385eb0ff19b7) for theSuperchainConfig(version1.1.0) has been deployed and initialized.The upgrade will also result in the following changes to the internal state of the existing L1 contracts, with the implementations corresponding to the addresseslisted here.Summary of these changes:TheL1CrossDomainMessengerwill be upgraded to version2.2.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.TheL1ERC721Bridgecontract will be upgraded to version2.0.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.TheL1StandardBridgecontract will be upgraded to version2.0.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.TheOptimismPortalcontract will be upgraded to version2.1.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.5. TheSystemConfigcontract will be upgraded to version1.11.0.6. TheL2OutputOraclecontract will be upgraded to version1.7.0.TheOptimismMintableERC20Factorycontract will be upgraded to version1.8.0.All L1 contracts have also had modifications to the source code formatting (white space and comment-style) which do not otherwise affect their behavior.Action PlanIf this proposal passes a Token House vote, the L1 contracts will be upgraded following the completion of the Citizens’ House Cycle#18Veto Period. The upgrade will be completed atomically such that all affected L1 contracts will be upgraded within a single transaction.As this is a contracts-only upgrade, no action is required by node operators."
Split delegation,"First message here, please be kind.I was wondering why do we have to delegate all our voting power to one person. Why can’t we split it the way we want. After all nobody represents 100% what we’re thinking. We might want to trust 2 different people to average our position somehow.What do you think?"
[FINAL] Upgrade Proposal #3: Delta Network Upgrade,"Executive SummaryTest in Prod proposes Delta network upgrade, which activates Span Batches for OP Mainnet and all other OP Chains.Span Batches implement a new batching specification that reduces L1 costs by~97% for inactive chains(165 ETH → 5 ETH).We expect Span Batches to derisk launching new OP Chains by meaningfully reducing L1 costs for inactive chains.Hello! This is Test in Prod, one of thecore development teamsof Optimism Collective.This is a proposal for the Delta network upgrade, which activatesSpan Batches. Span Batches is a new batching spec from Test in Prod, building upon initial designs by Protolambda.Span Batches removes the overhead of the current batching specs by encoding consecutive L2 blocks into one batch. This leads to reducing L1 costs by~97% for inactive chains, and6%~11% for performant chainslike OP Mainnet or Base Mainnet based on ourbacktesting results.Span Batches will support the adoption of the OP Stack by meaningfully reducing L1 costs for OP Chains, therefore reducing the risks of launching new L2s with the OP Stack.Technical SummarySpecificationThis upgrade (“Delta”) contains a single consensus-layer feature, Span Batches. Please refer to the following documents for the technical information on Span Batches:Design DocsSpec DocsGithub Issue TrackerResearch Repository(includes backtesting results & code for various OP Chains)Security ConsiderationsThe Span Batch is a consensus-critical feature. It is not required to undergo a security audit according to theOP Labs Audit Framework; Span Batches impacts liveness & reputational quadrant, instead of existential & safety parts in the rubrics of the Audit Framework—specifically derivation aside from deposits and batching. The Audit Framework doesn’t suggest audits in the liveness & reputational quadrant, but rather testing via progressive real-world usage.The Span Batch doesn’t have changes on the state transitions, so there is no possibility that users’ states can change in an unintended way. In the worst case, some transactions could be omitted.Therefore, Test in Prod went through the following steps to ensure the safety of this proposal, focusing on the liveness parts:1) Security review with OP LabsTest in Prod passed a security review with OP Labs. Since the Delta upgrade isn’t related to user assets, but instead implements a consensus upgrade, we focused on reviewing cases where the consensus could fail and built contingency plans for the failure. Please refer to theContingency Planssection in the current proposal for detailed contingency plans.Throughout the review, we figured that the Span Batch deployment would be less likely to impact Sequencer’s pre-confirming block production—the unsafe head progression; we expect end users to be less likely to be impacted in the majority of failure scenarios.2) Ran verification script on Superchain Devnet & TestnetsTest in Prod prepared theverification scriptfor Span Batches. The script checks the entire consensus process from posting batches on L1 to deriving L2 blocks from L1. It tests if there’s a consensus failure by detecting unsafe reorgs—ensuring nodes derive the same state that the Sequencer originally calculated before posting batches. Please refer to theFunctionality Verification Guidefor more details.The verification script works as follows:Send various types of transactions to the L2.Record the transactions’ hashes & included unsafe blocks’ hashes.Poll if the included blocks areconsolidated to safe.Compare recorded unsafe blocks’ hashes to safe blocks that include transactions.If same, it’s a success!3) E2E tests & unit testsTest in Prod prepared the e2e tests & unit tests for Span Batches. They cover a wide range of scenarios and check if the code operates as intended. Here are Github PRs for e2e tests:#1#2#3Impact SummaryPerformance ImpactSpan Batch saves more L1 fees than the current state of the OP Stack, and savings increase the less active the chain is. Therefore, Test in Prod expects more savings on L1 fees for less-active chains; we expect to save L1 feesby ~97% for low-throughput chainsand6%~11% for high-throughput chainslike OP Mainnet or Base Mainnet.Test in Prod backtested several OP Chains and prepared the expected L1 fee savings in %. Please refer to theExpected Result section in the Design Docsfor the result.User ImpactDelta doesn’t include any direct impact on the users’ side. Also, Test in Prod doesn’t expect downtime for the Delta upgrade.Node ImpactNodes will be unable to syncthe chain if nodes don’t perform the software update until the op-batcher operator starts posting Span Batches. Thus,nodes are required to update software versionsto keep in sync with the OP Chains.Please refer to theGuides for Nodessection in the current proposal for the upgrade details.Upgrade DetailsAfter Delta hard fork, Span Batches submission won’t be activated automatically; the op-batcher operators should restart their instance with the Span Batches enabled. Therefore, even though Delta hard fork time passes, nothing will happen until the op-batcher operator explicitly starts posting batches in the Span Batch.OP Chains can use (post & derive) both Singular Batches and Span Batches after the Delta hard fork.Action PlansTimeline (including finished items)Test in Prod proposes 00:00:00 Feb 22, 2024, UTC for the Delta hard fork time—1707922800 in Unix Timestamp. It’s three weeks after Voting Cycle#17ends, and two weeks after the Citizens’ House veto period.The Delta upgrade has already been activated on op-goerli, op-sepolia, base-goerli, base-sepolia, pgn-sepolia, zora-sepolia, and Superchain Devnet (operated by OP Labs, Base, and Conduit).Here’s the list of the timeline for Delta including finished items:Superchain Devnet activation at 00:00:00, Dec 08, 2023 UTC.Goerli Testnets activation at 00:00:00, Dec 21, 2023 UTC.Sepolia Testnets activation at 00:00:00, Dec 22, 2023 UTC.Voting results are final & start to notify upgrading nodes at 19:00:00, Jan 31, 2024 UTC.Including the one-week veto period.(Proposed) Mainnet activation at 00:00:00, Feb 22, 2024 UTC.Appended one week due to the veto period.Contingency PlansOur contingency plans for the unexpected failure of the Delta upgrade are as follows: op-batcher disables posting Span Batches, start posting legacy batches (Singular Batches), prepare the fix, and enable Span Batches again. In this way, we expect the impact on the user side will be minimized while resolving the issues—the sequencer would continue pre-confirming blocks as normal, but batch submission would be halted until the op-batcher restarts to push Singular Batches.However, if there’s an unexpected critical issue where we need nodes’ action, we have prepared a way for nodes to disable the upgrade by using--override.deltaflag on op-node. Test in Prod will work with OP Labs to monitor, communicate, and alert relevant parties upon the upgrade in such cases.Software versionsThe code for the Delta upgrade is ready in the following Optimism monorepo hash:54a7dbf8aa9b982f9c6a54cbbe448be41c0b7bc7.Nodes can manually set the Delta hard fork time with the preceding code. However, nodes will not automatically activate Delta on Mainnet as the Delta hard fork time is not embedded in the code; it cannot be embedded since Delta has not yet been approved by governance.If the governance approves the Delta hard fork and finalizes the hard fork time, Test in Prod will work with OP Labs to prepare the new release that embeds the Mainnet hard fork time and notify the community. With the new release, nodes won’t have to manually set the Delta hard fork time; but they will automatically activate the Delta upgrade.The following versions are deployed in the testnets:op-node: v1.4.1op-batcher: v1.4.1op-proposer: v1.4.1op-geth: v1.101304.2Guides for Node OperatorsNode operators are required to upgrade the software versions. Please refer to the following guides:Delta Upgrade Guide in Optimism DocsDelta Node Upgrade Guide(For op-batcher operators)Delta Hard Fork Functionality Verification GuideConclusionThis proposal outlines the Delta upgrade that includes Span Batches. This upgrade reduces the size overheads of the current specs in a significant step for less-active chains, and it leads to alleviating the risks of launching new OP Stack L2s.By reducing the L1 fees and risks with the Delta upgrade, we expect to alleviate burdens for less-active chains, help easier adoptions of the OP Stack, and head one step forward to the Superchain future.We don’t expect sequencer downtime for the Delta hard fork & activating Span Batches."
[FINAL] Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage Enforcement,"Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage EnforcementAfter discussions with the elected Token House Code of Conduct Council and the Grants Council, the Foundation would like to propose a change to two proposal types pertaining to grant misusage. The goal of these changes is to eliminate delegate responsibility for grant misusage enforcement. This is based on strong feedback from delegates that they do not wish to vote on enforcement actions and the establishment of an experimental Token House Code of Conduct Council, which could instead process grant misusage reports as representatives of the Token House.Currently, Collective grants may be clawed back for failure to meet critical milestones. The Grant Clawback is a proposal type, outlined in theOperating Manual, that currently requires a full Token House vote. Based on delegate feedback that delegates do not want to vote on Code of Conduct matters, this proposal would remove the Grant Clawback proposal type from theOperating Manualand re-classify Grant Clawback as an enforcement option under theGrant Policies(which are processed under the Code of Conduct, by the Token House Code of Conduct Council.)Currently, the Token House may implement a Future Grant Freeze against grant recipients that have violated theGrant Policies, enforceable via theCode of Conduct. We propose removing Future Grant Freeze as an enforcement action approved by the full Token House and replacing it with theGrant Misusage Process. This process outlines a clear protocol for the objective reporting and verification of grant misusage, to be documented in a public database that can be referenced by anyone when making future grant decisions. We believe this is a governance-minimized way to maintain accountability for grant recipients without requiring Token House delegates to be involved in enforcement decisions.This proposal is put forward by the Foundation and, therefore, does not require delegate approvals. This proposal will move to a vote in Voting Cycle#17."
[Temp Check] Burn surplus RetroPGF (+ monetary policy proposals),"Currently, there’s no monetary policy proposal type. So, this is not a proposal, but rather a conversation starter about some serious issues.This has been completely centralized, as decided by Optimism Foundation. The projections offered at genesis have not been honoured, andcurrent projectionsare also vague. Confidence in tokens or anything of economic value is derived from predictability and stability - which has been completely undermined in the name of experimentation. There’s billions of dollars at play here, we need to take things more seriously. The entire handling of $OP distribution has been haphazard. I believe $OP can do better with decentralized community checks and balances, and thus there should be monetary policy proposal types.While there are many errors and problems with the policy, the most obvious issue is - the RetroPGF allocation.I’ve discussed burning it in the past, so let’s revisit that topic. As per initial projections announced at genesis, 100% of the RetroPGF (along with Ecosystem Fund) was intended to be allocated by the end of Year 4:image1920×914 97 KBHowever, after nearly 2 years in, only 40 million, or ~4.7% would have been distributed.Current projectionsare radically different [please see Erratum below, the next figures are wrong], calling for only 140 million OP to be distributed by the end of year 5. This is only 16% of the initial projections, despite the 1 extra year. To be clear, this is a more reasonable projection than the ones initially offered, but that leaves a massive overhang of 700 million $OP tokens. At the end of 5 years, over ~75% of pending unlock (effectively inflation) will be RPGF alone.It’s obvious that RPGF was severely overallocated at genesis, and >6x gap between initial projections and current projections reflects the magnitude of the error. My recommendation is to burn the ~700 million OP that was overallocated to RPGF, while honouring the current projections till year 5.[Erratum: As@danftzpoints out below, it’s actually 340 million OP per the projections, with the overhang being ~500M OP, not ~700M OP. I’d prefer to see 140M OP be distributed, as that’s plenty for RPGF.]To be clear, this does not mean the end of RPGF at the end of year 5. 5 years in for the OP Collective, and nearly a decade in for the Optimism Foundation and its predecessor Plasma Group at large, it’s about time to consolidate and become economically sustainable. Beyond that point, a ~75% overhang is unjustified. So, RPGF will continue, but in a different form, that’s sustainable:Share of protocol revenues (sequencer, MEV, OP stack chains etc.)Share of regular inflation (currently 0%, but we can bump it to 1% or 2% after year 5)This will lead to:A more sustainable RPGFClarity in the massive RPGF overhang, leading to increase confidence and long-term value in the $OP token, leading to higher economic security and sustainabilityIncrease in net value of $OP tokens by ~16% due to the lower supplyThese are just my thoughts, please voice your opinion below.PS: I’ve changed the title to “Burn surplus RetroPGF” from “Burn RetroPGF”"
Optimism Expansion Defi,"Describe the solution you’d like:I propose implementing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) within the Optimism Blockchain ecosystem. This IDS would actively monitor and analyze network activities, identifying and alerting the community to potential security threats or anomalies. A system designed to enhance the overall security posture of the Optimism Collective.Describe alternatives you’ve considered:I’ve considered alternative approaches, such as relying solely on external third-party security tools. However, having an in-house Intrusion Detection System tailored to the specific needs and nuances of the Optimism Blockchain would provide a more customized and integrated security solution. Otherwise I’d suggest integrating tools and building out a testing framework. A portion of funding to analyze wallet attacks. Then utilize the information for the collective. To focus on tools and resources needed to optimize.Additional context:Given the complexity and evolving nature of blockchain security, having an internal IDS offers the advantage of real-time threat detection and response. It aligns with the Optimism Collective’s commitment to security and community well-being. Integrating this system would contribute to a safer and more resilient blockchain environment for all participants. Blockchain is always evolving, but if this goes with a project I would like to help, or contribute."

Security Council: Vote #1 - Change to Security Model,"For full context on the implementation of the Security Council, please readIntro to Optimism’s Security CouncilSecurity Council: Vote#1- Change to Security ModelThe proposal that follows requests Token House approval for a change to the security model of OP Mainnet. This change does not constitute a Protocol Upgrade.SummaryThis is a proposal to turn proxy admin keys for OP Mainnet over to a public, decentralized set of individual actors (“participants”) accountable to Optimism Governance: i.e., theSecurity Council.Specifically, for this initial Security Council proposal (Vote # 1), Governance will vote to approve the addition of the Security Council as one signer (of two) on a 2/2 multisig that controls protocol upgrades for OP Mainnet. The other signer on the multisig will be the current Foundation multisig.If this proposal passes, it will approve a change similar tothis illustrative example.There will be an on-chain change of the ProxyAdmin’s owner from0x9ba6e03d8b90de867373db8cf1a58d2f7f006b3ato a new 2 of 2 multisig (0xdc53b1d440b8a56dd50a6d69312dac903d3aa48b, in the example provided above).The state diff for the above example can be foundhere.Security ConsiderationsThe Security Council will operate a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet.Participants will carry out their roles in accordance with theCharterincluding the following key points:Duringnormal operations, the Security Council will implement the protocol upgrade and role designation decisions (such as designations for the sequencer, proposer, and challenger roles, as well as designating the composition of the participants on the Security Council multisig) made by Optimism Governance. The Security Council simply does as Governance directs. It does not directly evaluate the “merit” of the accompanying proposed code (e.g., for security purposes); that evaluation is the responsibility of Governance.During definedemergency situations, the Security Council is empowered to act preemptively, without direct Governance approval, in order to keep the network safe and secure. Each participant may also take actions they or the Optimism Foundation believes to be necessary to comply with applicable law.Dysfunctional participants, either individually or acting as a quorum, can be effectively checked, without undermining the security advantages motivating the formation of the Council in the first place.ConclusionYou can read the complete Security Council Charterhere. Technically, neither the existence of a Security Council nor its Charter needs to be approved via governance. However, since the implementation of this proposedSecurity Councilrepresents a fundamental change to OP Mainnet’s security model, the Optimism Foundation is requesting approval to implement the change.If this proposal passes with a 76% approval threshold (30% quorum), the Optimism Foundation will move forward with the implementation of theSecurity Council.Note:Through subsequent Governance proposals and votes, it is intended that this Security Council will eventually extend beyond OP Mainnet, to secure all other OP Chains within the Superchain (read more). The ultimate goal is preventing any single party from being able to upgrade the system, modify rollup state, or censor transactions.What Does this Mean for Delegates?This proposal will go to a vote in Special Voting Cycle#16a."
[FINAL] Upgrade Proposal #2: Canyon Network Upgrade,"Executive SummaryHi I’m Joshua, an engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem, and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.Upgrade#2, Canyon is the first proposed network upgrade after Bedrock. Canyon contains the Shapella network upgrade from Ethereum, a change to reduce the volatility of the basefee, and several minor bug fixes. The Canyon upgrade will maintain EVM equivalence & improve the ergonomics of using the OP Stack for developers and end users. In addition, node operators will need to upgrade their nodes to stay in sync. Canyon brings the OP Stack protocol version to v4.0.0.If this vote passes, Canyon will activate onop-mainnet,base-mainnet,pgn-mainnet, &zora-mainnetonThu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024(Unix Time1704992401)  barring a critical security issue. All op-node versions after v1.3.1 & all op-geth versions after v1.101304.1 are compatible with Canyon. We will release a new version of op-node & op-geth with the Canyon activation time baked in if the vote passes governance.SpecificationsTechnical SpecificationWe are activating the following features as part of the Canyon upgrade. FullCanyon Specificationin Github.ShapellaEIP-3651: Warm COINBASEEIP-3855: PUSH0 instructionEIP-3860: Limit and meter initcodeEIP-4895: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operationsEIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCTProhibit withdrawals in OP Stack blocksP2P SpecBlock Building SpecEIP-1559 Parameter ChangesIncreasing EIP-1559 Denominator from 50 to 250SpecificationAdjust Channel OrderingThe first ready channel is now read rather than the first channel when it is readySpecificationReceipt Hash ChangeThe deposit nonce is included in the deposit receipt hashSpecificationcreate2DeployerWe are deploying standardized bytecode to0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2SpecificationSecurity ConsiderationsConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, OP Labs did not have the contents of Canyon audited; however OP Labs did perform a security review of these changes.The Shapella L1 upgrade consists of relatively standard EVM changes & the addition of beacon chain withdrawals. OP Labs considers the EVM changes low risk because they have been active on L1 without issue. Withdrawals are a new L1 codepath to create arbitrary mints in the EVM. OP Labs has ensured that this type of transaction cannot occur on L2…The next set of changes, EIP-1559 config change, the channel ordering change, and the receipt hash change also are low risk changes. They do not modify any code path which is responsible for securing user funds and have been tested.The last change, the create2Deployer, presents a larger user facing change. Canyon unconditionally modifies the bytecode of the0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2address. This address already has the create2Deployer on it on some, but not all, networks. OP Labs has validated that the contract code deployed by Canyon matches the public ABI of the existing contract. This upgrade does remove portions of the admin ABI (pausing, ownable), but OP Labs has confirmed that the contract author is ok with removing the Ownable & Pausable functionality. A typical developer would not be able to call these functions.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade. This network upgrade does not contain backwards incompatible changes for end users.Shapella is important to retain compatibility with Ethereum. One change to be aware of is the deprecationwarningof the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. The behavior of the opcode is not changing in Canyon, but is expected to change in a future network upgrade. Ethereum is expected to implementEIP-6780in the Dencun network upgrade to modify this opcode, and the Optimism community should expect to follow this change in the spirit of EVM equivalence.The EIP-1559 Denominator will be changing from 50 to 250. OP Labs is proposing this change to decrease volatility in the basefee on the OP Stack. By increasing the denominator, the amount the basefee increases is reduced when the gas used is over the gas target. A denominator of 50 was initially chosen for Bedrock such that the basefee on the OP Stack would decrease at approximately a rate of -12% per 12s when the block were completely empty. This matches the decrease of Ethereum’s basefee. The rate of increase with completely full blocks was 77% over 12s because the gas limit on the OP Stack is 6x the gas target. Since Bedrock, 2 minutes of full congestion (30m gas blocks) on the OP Stack would result in an increased base fee of ****304x ****(1.1^60) ******vs 2 minutes of full congestion on L1 Ethereum would result in an increased base fee of3.24x(1.125^10). OP Labs is suggesting a denominator of 250 to match the rate of increase of Ethereum when OP Stack blocks are completely full. This will also reduce how quickly the basefee decays when blocks are empty and will enable users to have their transactions included more easily during periods of high usage.Canyon modifies the protocol to handle unclosed channels. Previously, only a single channel could be active at a time and if the channel was not closed, it would need to time out before progress could resume. Following the upgrade, the op-node will read the first channel that is ready.A new field will be added to the deposit transaction receipt encoding. It modifies the encoding to fix a bug where the deposit transaction nonce was not in consensus encoding.Finally, Canyon sets the create2Deployer bytecode at0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2on all OP networks. This enables developers to have access to this commonly used contract on all OP networks, not just OP Mainnet. This also particularly helps users on Base mainnet, where, due to a deployment issue, the create2Deployer is not able to be deployed to this address. Block explorers may have to re-verify the create2Deployer contract.Action PlanIf this vote passes, the Canyon upgrade will be schedule for execution 5 ****weeks after the vote passes, onThu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024.The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Canyon is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit6cce3728b7bed5e36234aeba3b773e0f97867be3and op-geth at commited8e9f54ed0a5069e77ea34895ff12a9ac4ca17f. The op-node release v1.3.1 and op-geth release v1.101304.1 contain these changes. These commits do not contain the Canyon timestamp for mainnet. These releases could be used on mainnet by using the--override.canyonflag. OP Labs will release a future version of op-node & op-geth with the Canyon time configured if governance approves this upgrade.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets in coordination with Base & Conduit. It successfully activated onop-goerli,op-sepolia,base-goerli,base-sepolia,pgn-sepolia, &zora-sepoliaon November 14 at 17:00:00 UTC.If there is a critical security issue, node operators will be able to disable the upgrade by using the—override.canyonflag on both op-node & op-geth. OP Labs will also collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade is no longer happening.OP Labs will release a new version of op-node & op-geth with the Canyon activation date baked in and publicize to node operators & end users that the Canyon upgrade will be occurring.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the Optimism Collective’s first network upgrade after Bedrock titled Canyon. This network upgrade maintains EVM equivalence via activating the Shapella network upgrade and includes several OP Stack specific improvements.We expect that this upgrade will not result in any down time and will occur atThu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024."

Ratification: Law of Chains,"Ratification: Law of ChainsThe proposal constitutes a ratification of the Law of Chains. The Law of Chains is one of the most important governing documents of the Optimism Collective. The Law of Chains is not a procedural specification or playbook for Optimism Governance toenactdecisions in a multi-chain context. Instead, it is a neutrality framework intended to reliablyinformgovernance decisions.You can reference the full draft of the Law of Chainshere.A section-by-section summary can be foundhere.Thank you to the delegates for leaving valuable community feedback on the draft over the past several months. We’ve responded in a series of responses startinghere.What does the Law of Chains mean for governance?The Law of Chains forms the basis for many processes and accountability structures in governing the Superchain. In upcoming Seasons, community members can expect to apply the Law of Chains in the following ways:Season 5 will introduce an Allowlist of acceptable sequencers for OP Chains to use. This Allowlist will be maintained by governance: sequencers can submit a proposal to the Token House to be added to this Allowlist.Token House voters should evaluate the proposed sequencers’ commitment to upholding the Law of Chains in deciding whether to approve them or not.Token House voters may also vote to remove a sequencer from the Allowlist if the sequencer is in violation of any part of the Law of Chains (for example, if the sequencer is impermissibly censoring user transactions).Future protocol upgrades should be evaluated to understand their impact to each stakeholder in the Superchain (users, chain governors, and chain servicers), along with the platform as a whole, so voters can make sure each protocol upgrade continues to uphold the Law of Chain’s assurances.RatificationIf ratified, the Law of Chains will be appended as an addendum to theWorking Constitution. Procedures for Optimism Governance to implement the Law of Chains will then be added to theOperating Manual(for example, a process for sequencer additional or removal).As outlined in the Operating Manual, Token House Ratification requires a 51% approval threshold (30% quorum)."
Inflation Adjustment Proposal Template,"BackgroundInflation of the OP token is set to a default % each year. This inflation takes place via theMintManagercontract calling themint()function on the OP token contract at0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042.This inflation parameter can be adjusted by Optimism Collective Governance. While the Citizens’ House is still in early stages, inflation adjustment will be determined via vote from the Token House, as specified in theOperating Manual.Note that this may not be the final governance process for inflation; the system may evolve as additional governance rights and capabilities come online.Inflation accrues to the “Unallocated” portion of the OP token allocations. The Unallocated portion of the token supply is held in reserve for future programs. For now, the Collective is focused on building healthy processes around the existing active portions of the token supply.How the Inflation Adjustment Vote worksIn the Voting Cycle that ends closest to and before May 31st, the Token House may vote to set inflation to any value between 0% and 2%, inclusive.If no proposal passes, inflation will remain at the rate last approved by governance.In 2024, an Inflation Adjustment Vote may take place inSpecial Voting Cycle#23a, which runs from May 23 - May 29, 2024. If more than one Inflation Adjustment Proposal is passed by governance, the proposal with the highest ratio ofyesvotes to total votes cast will pass.Inflation Adjustment should follow the template provided below and will need 4 top 100 delegate approvals by May 22nd at 19:00 GMT to proceed to a vote in Special Voting Cycle#23a, as outlined in theOperating Manual.Inflation Adjustment Proposal TemplateInflation Adjustment Proposals should follow the template below:SummaryWhat is this inflation adjustment proposal?MotivationWhy should the Collective adjust inflation?SpecificationThis proposal would set an inflation rate for [YEAR] of [X%].If approved, and if not superceeded by another Inflation Adjustment Proposal with higher approval, this proposal will result in a one-time mint of OP of [X]% of the current total supply (4,294,967,296 OP) equal to[Y]tokens. This inflation will occur on or shortly after May 31 and accrues to the “unallocated” portion of the token supply.If not approved, and unless another Inflation Adjustment Proposal is approved, inflation will remain at the rate last approved by governance, which was 0%. Inflation will occur on or shortly after May 31 and accrues to the “unallocated” portion of the token supply.Impact SummaryExpected effects resulting from inflation adjustmentExpected impact to key stakeholders in the Collective"

Having a tool built out so claiming can be done, in a way that drives delegation, on an official website is an important step for our processAny tooling or simulations that help voters better understand protocol upgrades and feel confident in their executionResearch and Analysis on Key Governance Parameters:Analyses / simulation of different voting mechanisms and potential impact on probability of capture (public vs. private voting tradeoffs, etc.)Research on governance attacks in token-voting systems (ie. attack simulation / research on “healthy” thresholds / identification of failure modes) and non-plutocractic governance or voting systems (bribery, collusion, corruption, etc.)Analysis of social graph and attestation data to output a probability (and corresponding attestation) that any one Farcaster account is a SybilAnalysis of Governance Fund Grants contribution towards the Intents and corresponding target metricsAnalysis of different grant programs and their failure modesAnalysis of which on-chain actions are high signal for engaged governance participantsDriving DelegationInitiatives to meaningfully drive delegation and / or distribution of votable supply among a broad set of specific stakeholders, such as:Contracts that support advanced delegation featuresDelegate incentive programsSuccess metricsNumber of addresses voting for the first timeNumber of addresses delegating for the first timeTotal amount of OP delegated from new addresses using the grantee’s protocolNote: Critical DAO infrastructure that doesn’t integrate with the Foundation’s governance roadmap or architecture, generalized initiatives aimed at increasing voter participation or participant onboarding, and/or hard to maintain educational resources have had limited impact on progress towards decentralization in the pastConsumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be supported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target governance metric.Intent 2: Bring Chains to the SuperchainSupported by other mechanisms in the Collective (seeherefor full details.)Intent 3: Grow Application Devs on the SuperchainTarget metric: 9,500 active developers driving usage across the SuperchainThis Intent is subdivided into two portions:Intent 3A:OP Mainnet Mission Requests will be created by The Grants Council and approved by the Token HouseIntent 3B:One Superchain Grant Mission Request will be created by The Foundation and approved by the Token HouseProposed Gov Fund Budget: 18M OP (3A + 3B)Intent 3A:6M OP for builders on OP MainnetIntent 3B:12M OP for chain-specific grant programs supporting the SuperchainIntent 3A - Suggested Mission Requests:The below recommended Mission Requests apply to OP Mainnet, but can be incorporated by any chain running their own grants program supported by Intent 3B.Note: Previously, many applications under this Intent fell under generalized “builders” or “growth experiments” grants programs. This distinction refers primarily to grant type and is less relevant now that applicants can apply for hybrid grants. In Season 6, we recommend all grant applications fall under a specific Mission Request, aimed at a specific type of user and/or developer growth, rather than running catch all programs based on grant type.DeFi:Shift Ethereum TVL to OP MainnetImprove Cross-Chain Liquidity (for example, but not limited to, DEXs w/ cross-protocol or cross-chain liquidity aggregation)Improve Trading Efficiency (for example, but not limited to, DEXs w/ off-chain order books)Improve Lending Efficiency (for example, but not limited to, novel money markets)Simplified Perpetuals DEXsStablecoins: Improve Superchain liquidity by increasing access to stablecoinsMulti-chain, USD, or non-USD StablecoinsGaming:Onboard and support more quality game developers to the Optimism EcosystemSupport gaming teams interested in building their own L2 or L3Support gaming teams looking to expand or migrate from another ecosystem to the SuperchainSupport teams that are looking to deploy fully on-chain gamesAI/ML: Establish Optimism as the ecosystem and codebase to build on/with for AI/ML uses, applications, and L2sIncrease the number of machine learning engineers and researchers in the Optimism ecosystemSuccess metricsGrowth:TVL in grantee’s protocolNumber of transactions emitting event logsNumber of active addresses interacting with grantee’s contractsTotal amount of gas fees generated from grantee’s contractsStickiness:% of retained active addresses interacting with grantee’s contractsDAA/MAA ratioDeveloper Tooling:Number of testnet transactions emitting event logsNumber of active developer addresses interacting with grantee’s contractsConsumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be supported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target governance metric.Intent 3B - Mission Request:There will be one Mission Request under Intent 3B, proposed by the Foundation. Consistent with Optimism’s approach to governance, we will evaluate this Mission Request as an experiment to learn we can best support developer growth across the Superchain. The approach in future seasons may change based on learnings, feedback, and iteration.Under this Mission Request, L2 Chains listed in theSuperchain Registry(orsimilar) will be able to request OP to make grants within their own ecosystems. This is similar to Distributed Domain Allocation and creates a scalable strategy to support the broader Superchain by empowering OP Chains to leverage their ecosystem specific expertise.If this Mission Request is approved, the Grants Council will process applications from OP Chains requesting tokens to run their own grants program but will not process individual grant applications for other OP Chains.  Qualifying OP Chains do not have to have an existing public grants program in order to apply.Suggested framework for relative allocation under this Mission Request:We suggest allocating 65% of the Intent 3B Budget to OP Chains already in the Superchain, distributed pro-rata based on contribution to the Collective to date (excluding OP Mainnet)We suggest reserving the remaining 35% of the Intent 3B Budget for new OP Chains, defined as having launched mainnet within the last six months, joining the Superchain throughout the Season. In the case of new Chains, we recommend budget be allocated according to the Foundation’s Chain Health Framework (more information to be provided as soon as possible.)We suggest a cap of 3M OP for any individual L2 OP Chain, to prevent winner takes all dynamicsParticipating OP Chains are encouraged to make grants consistent with approved Mission Requests under Intent#3A. OP Chains should not use their grants to run grant programs that directly target users from any other OP Chain (e.g. making grants to migrate protocols from Mainnet to another chain).Participating OP Chains are also encouraged to coordinate with the Grants Council on best practices to create a consistent grants application process across the Superchain and to avoid repeating mistakes we’ve already learned from. For the sake of shared learning, it is highly encouraged that all participating OP Chains publish a retrospective at the end of the Season.Any tokens not granted via OP Chain grants programs at the end of the Season shall be returned to the Governance Fund. Grants to OP Chains will be subject to the typical milestone based delivery and assessment process. Grants made by OP Chains will also be subject to theGrant Policies.OP Chains participating in this program will be required to sign an agreement with the Foundation to this effect."
Round 4 Bribery Policy,"Round 4 Bribery PolicyIt is expected thatOptimistsrefrain from self-dealing. While opportunities for self-dealing in the Citizens’ House will be reduced via incentive design and voting mechanisms, the Foundation may implement additional measure to discourage self-dealing, to be defined at the beginning of each Round, while these mechanisms are further developed.In Round 4, the opportunity for self-dealing will be limited by metrics-based voting as badgeholders will no longer vote on individual projects but the possibility of bribery still exists. The Foundation has defined the below process to address bribery, if needed.Over time, the consequences for bribery and other forms of self-dealing will be determined by the Citizens’ House and enforced via governance managed Citizenship Criteria.Round 4 Anti-Bribery PolicyReportingYou may report any verifiable instance of bribery using the form linkedhere. All discussions and reports should be in accordance with theRules of Engagement.As onchain evidence of bribery is unlikely, three separate reports against the same briber (or directly affiliated party) will need to be filed for a case to be considered valid. This number is based upon the number of people required for a bribe have a meaningful impact on results and considering the potential disruption of false reports.EnforcementIn the event 3 separate reports are filed, and the briber is another badgeholder, the bribing badgeholder will receive an attestation and be prohibited from participating in Season 6.In the event 3 separate reports are filed, and the briber is a project, the project will receive an attestation and be removed from the Round (ineligible to receive rewards in Round 4).In the event any report is found to be invalid, the badgeholder will receive an attestation and will be ineligible to receive retroactive governance participant rewards for Round 4.Please note: In the future, governance will decide the set of attestations that permit or prohibit Citizenship.Subject to Citizens’ House ApprovalBefore any enforcement action is taken, the Foundation must post a proposal summarizing the reported bribery incident and corresponding enforcement actions. The Citizens’ House will then have one week to veto any enforcement decisions proposed by the Foundation. If an enforcement action suggested by the Foundation is veto’d, no enforcement action will take place. New reports filed about the same instance will not be re-considered."

Season 6: Collective Reward Framework,"Special thanks to@alisha.eth,@brichis,@ceresstation,@GFXlabs,@Gonna.eth, and@teresacdfor feedback and suggestions as part of theFeedback CommissionSeason 6: Collective Rewards FrameworkWhat is this Framework For?As several governance structures have been introduced in the Token House over the past few Seasons, and as Citizens’ House governance comes online, it’s important to have a framework to set  rewards consistently across the Collective. To this end, the below non-binding, guidelines provide a suggested framework to think about Collective rewards, and are not meant to serve as a rigid or binding policy encapsulating all possible scenarios.The primary use case will be in the Token House’s evaluation of prospective budgets, but these guidelines can also help ensure more consistency and predictability for voter rewards (delivered retroactively at the end of each Season, based on governance participation.) They are not necessarily meant to be used in Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds.How will this Framework Evolve?This suggested framework is a step towards transitioning more allocation decision making to the community. In Season 7, we plan to introduce a Budget Board to make recommendations to the Collective about allocation parameters. The Budget Board may use these guidelines as a starting point from which they propose a rewards framework or policy to be ratified by governance. Our recommendation is that any future policy be kept as streamlined as possible. The more complexity and/ or the more variables involved, the more difficult forecasting and budgeting will be for the Collective in the future.General GuidelinesIt is important to remember that the Governance Fund is a temporary mechanism and that most* governance operations will need to transition to be supported by Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).Distributing rewards retroactively solves many of the compensation and budgeting problems prevalent in other DAOs. However, until the Retro Funding mechanism is reliable enough to support the entire Collective, we recommend setting budgets with a target of 20% of rewards coming from Retro Funding, understanding this ratio should transition towards ~100% for most contributions in the long term. Accordingly, the percentage of rewards expected to be received via Retro Funding should be noted in all budget proposals.Throughout Season 6, the Foundation will consider additional mechanisms to bridge the gap between Token House contributions and Retro Funding, which may include novel reward mechanisms similar tobackstop grants.All rewards are entirely in OP.Foundation and Delegate Mission Request grants are locked for one year, unless supporting user incentives (full detailshere.)Stipends for elected representatives are distributed periodically throughout the Season and are unlocked.All retroactive rewards are unlocked.*Mission critical contributions, such as core development and/or security, may always require some degree of prospective grants.**The Code of Conduct Council is an exception to this policy given the nature of their work, which is best suited to a higher percentage of retroactive rewards so as not incentivize conflict or bureaucracy.Guidelines by Contribution TypeThere are several different types of contributions to the CollectiveAd hoc:These contributions are open to anyone!These contributions may include research and analysis, hosting community calls, and/orBuilder IdeasThese contributions are best suited to be rewarded via Retro FundingContribution Paths:These contributions are open to anyone who has completed all steps in the pre-defined path (notelected)All the NERD programs and the Ambassadors are contribution pathsContribution paths may be supported via a combination of bounties, via Foundation or Delegate Mission Requests, but are best suited to Retro Funding in the longer term. Contribution paths are led by “Maintainers,” which are similar to “Leads” on Councils, and may be supported initially by Foundation Mission Requests.Representatives:Elected contributors that act as representatives. Please note that most contributors should not be elected, (seeDAO Design Principles.)Representatives currently serve on Council or Boards that are established via theCollective Representative Frameworkas part of higher level system design that suggests the Collective can only support 4-5 of these bodies and ~50 representatives.Elected representatives currently receive stipends from the Governance Fund. Stipends should correspond to Impact Ratings.Governance participantsHighly engaged governance participants receive retro rewards.You can reference thischartfor the types of contributions that may be rewarded. Rewards should correspond to Impact Ratings.This comes out of the Unallocated portion of the token supply right now, but will need to be supported by Retro Funding eventually.Service ProvidersThe Collective intentionally does not support persistent working groups staffed with full time DAO contributors, instead supporting autonomous Service Providers via Mission Requests and/or Retro Funding.OP Labs and other Core Devs (Sunnyside Labs, Agora, etc.) can be thought of as Service Providers, as can other Mission Applicants.Service Providers may be supported by Foundation or Delegate Mission Requests initially but should eventually be supported entirely by Retro Funding.p0 Service Providers may also be supported by private RetroPGF backstop grantsThe amount a Service Provider may be rewarded is currently based on theirTrust Tier. More advanced frameworks for rewarding Service Providers may be proposed over time.Impact Rating FrameworkThis rewards framework is based on the concept of Impact Ratings. Impact Ratings are conceptual, to be used as a non-binding guide in determining budgets or rewards for various contributions.This framework does not imply rewards will or should be made for all contributions that fall under an Impact Rating. Conversely, contributions that fall outside these examples may still be rewarded. Governance participants should use this framework to reason about which rating a given contribution would fall under and/or whether a given contributor should receive above/below the amount suggested by the corresponding Impact Rating (ie. leadership positions on a Council.) Impact Ratings will not be officially assigned or tracked as they are merely a decision making tool for the community to better assess budget requests and understand voter rewards.Why Impact Ratings?It is a design principle of the Collective to focus on outputs (impact) rather than inputs (amount of work) and we believe this approach should be reflected in a Collective Reward Framework. This framework also allows for the flexibility required to be adaptive over time while preserving the integrity of OP as a governance token (1 OP = 1 OP.) Given the need to be adaptive and the Collective’s approach to iteration and learning, each Season, the amount of OP suggested for each Impact Rating will be adjusted, and ratified, as appropriate.Below are the suggested Impact Ratings for Season 6. Suggested rewards are on a per contributor basis.Impact 1=Contributes to theaccessibilityof the Collective; no specialized skills or context neededEngaging in behaviors that promoteCollective Values, such as disclosing conflicts of interest, promoting long term decision making, or empowering community members to make better decisions.Suggested Season 6 Rewards: 250 OP per SeasonImpact 2=Contributes to theaccessibilityof the Collective; some specialized skills and context neededCompleting actions or tasks that require some understanding and or specialised skill.

The unique nature of the Code of Conduct Council requires a majority of retroactive rewards.All of the contributor roles and associated rewards described here are intended for independent and engaged community members who volunteer to provide their knowledge and expertise to the Collective and receive an honorarium in the form of OP. These volunteers are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any of its affiliates for any purposes."

Season 6: Mission Request Creation Guide,"This document is only relevant to members of the Grants Council and the Collective Feedback Commission.Season 6: Mission Request Creation GuideWhat’s a Mission?To understand Missions, you first need to understandIntents. Intents are directional goals that allow the Collective to align on near term targets.image1380×452 47.6 KBMissions are specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. They are tightly scoped and can be accomplished start-to-finish in less than 12 months.Mission Requests outline specific initiatives delegates want to see built for the Collective. Teams can then apply for a Mission grant to fulfill a Request. The Grants Council selects applicants.Mission Requests are pre-specified requests for grants that work towards the Collective Intents. A Mission Request outlines an initiative to be executed but does not assign a team to execute it.Example Mission Requests:Intent 1: Progress Towards Decentralization (Governance)Mission Request#1:Create Governance v3 contract for the CollectiveMission Request#2:Onboard 100 new delegatesYou can see the list of Mission Requests the Foundation suggests for Season 6here.Who Can Create a Mission Request?In Season 6, Mission Requests will be created by the following partiesIntent#1:Feedback CommissionIntent#2:Not supported by the Governance FundIntent#3A:Grants CouncilIntent#3B:Foundation Growth TeamMembers of the Feedback Commission and or Grants Council may chose to sponsor ideas from any other community member. It is up to these members to decide how they want to facilitate the sponsorship process, but the Foundation will create a thread where community members can propose ideas for sponsorship.When are Mission Requests Created?Mission Requests will only be proposed and approved at the beginning of each Season.You can think of this as the Collective’s bi-annual budgeting process; it only happens at the start of each Season. While this creates some limitations, this process is designed to prioritize work and incentivize execution, which are common challenges in many DAOs.This process is not intended occur again until Season 7.The above is subject to evaluation based on learnings throughout the Season. A mid-point re-assessment may be considered if deemed necessary based on demand and the need to be adaptive throughout Season 6.How Do I Create a Mission Request?For Feedback Commission and Grants Council Members Reference OnlyPlease note that Mission Requests can only be supported under one Intent and must fall within scope for thatIntentMission Requests are meant to support specific initiatives that can be completed start to finish (markeddone) and are not meant to contract ongoing services and/or working groupsMission Requests should specify the work to be done but not the specific team to complete itMission Requests should not rely on Foundation action or supportMission Requests that are similar should be combined to prevent redundancyMission Requests may not propose metagovernance changes and/or structures (such as the creation of committees and/or Councils). Please see thePath to Open Metagovernanceto understand how and when those proposal rights will come online.SpecificationIt is recommended that Mission Requests outline a high level goal to be achieved but refrain from over-specifying the specific tactics to achieve that goal.For example:Increase the number of active developers, globallyNotHost hackathon in EuropeBest Practices for Measuring the Success of a Mission RequestThe Collective as a whole isdriving towards making better data-driven decisions. A key of this is measuring impact upon completion of this Mission!Milestones:These measures should measure progress towards completion, including expected completion dates for each is recommendedGood milestones…Should be easily verifiable and ideally verifiable on chainShould be objectionable in its completion-ability. The outcome shouldn’t be a subjective metric.Source of Truth which is the proof for completion should be laid out in a clear and cohesive manner.Should correspond with logical checkpoints in a grants completion stages.Metrics:In order to standardize evaluation, it is recommended that metrics for success and milestones tie back to the target metrics listed under the relevant Intent.It’s important to understand these mission grants will be measured on their ability to drive the high-level metric from the specific intentTo make the measurement of performance more actionable, it’s recommended that the high-level metric from the intent be broken down into more detailed metricsUsing concrete performance metrics should remove subjectivity from the evaluation process and provide insights about the effectiveness of Mission RequestsImpact:These measures should be focused on performance and may be used to assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of Retro FundingYou can think of impact as how much the Mission Request contributes to the high-level metric, whereas the metrics make that impact measurableOver time, it’s important to understand how different growth levers contribute to our Intents and shed some light on which mechanisms best support which types of contributionsMission Request TemplatePlease note Missions must be completed within 12 months (i.e. marked asdone).Delegate Mission Request Summary:Mission Requests should be tightly scoped and well-specified. You can see exampleshere. You should describe your Mission Request in 1-2 sentences here.S6Intent:Please list the Intent your Request aligns with hereProposing Delegate/Citizen:Delegate name/pseudonym, linked to delegate profileTotal grant amount:This amount should reflect the total amount required to execute the Mission. If a Request specifies multiple applicants, the grant amount should reflect the total OP required to support all qualified applicants. (e.g., if the Request is to make 50k OP grants to 4 applicants, you could specify the total grant amount as 200k OP.)We have suggested applicants request 80% of the amount of impact they believe they will generate, incentivizing the rest to be rewarded retroactively based on quality of execution in future Retro Funding Rounds.For clarity, additional Retro Funding is never guaranteed and applicants should not submit applications on the assumption that they will receive more than the upfront grant.Should this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:Select from: “One,” “Up to X” or “Multiple”How will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?Please explain alignment with the relevant IntentWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?Please list responsibilities and/or expected deliverablesHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Milestones:These measures should measure progress towards completion, including expected completion dates for each is recommendedMetrics:In order to standardize evaluation, it is recommended that metrics for success and milestones tie back to the target metrics listed under each Intent as much as possible.Impact:These measures should be focused on performance and may be used to assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of Retro FundingHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?If so, who, and what parts of this application did they contribute to?

Revenue Opportunities for the Optimism Collective,"The post “Accelerated Decentralization Proposal For Optimism” sparked a fruitful conversation that helped highlight an unresolved tension:several delegates maintain the thesis that sequencer fees are going to 0.Considering that Optimism’s revenues are tied to sequencer revenues, exploring alternative ways to generate income (contributing to the sustainability of the collective and its programs) is highly strategic.Accelerated Decentralization Proposal For OptimismThe value proposition of the Superchain may be correct, but we, along with other delegates, continue to maintain the thesis that sequencer fees are going to 0.While there is no ‘immediate urgency’ to achieve this, I believe it would be beneficial to start a deeper conversation on this topic to tap into the collective intelligence.To give structure to the process, I propose using the first two steps suggested by the ‘collective proposal creation’described in the sociocratic model.I like this framework because it emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem and defining ‘the rules of the game’ before jumping into suggesting solutions in a creative brainstorming process.Collective Proposal Creation:Step 1 – Understanding the Issue: First, a moment where we focus on grasping the context before diving into solutions. The intention is to create a list of ‘dimensions’ that the proposal should include or take into consideration to address the underlying needs and ensure it is sustainable over time.Step 2 – Explore Ideas: A moment to aspire to collective creativity, widening the scope of ideas.Step 2a – Picture forming (dimensions): It is confirmed that there is shared understanding and acceptance of the ‘list of dimensions’ to consider, ensuring that all elements are compatible with each other.Step 2b – Gathering proposal ideas: A brainstorming session is invited, which can occur synchronously or asynchronously. Here, ideas may oppose each other. The goal is quantity over quality. Ideally, we all chip in with ideas.Step 2c – Synthesize: A smaller group of participants (whether representatives of stakeholders or leaders in the process) are invited to create a “Frankenstein” that integrates the best of all ideas in a way that addresses the entire (or a good portion of the) list of dimensions.The result of this synthesis could be seen as a valuable input for the OP Foundation to create a proposal based on it, as suggested in the current phase of ‘The Path to Open Metagovernance’.List of dimensions:Therefore, the first step would be to agree (both the Foundation and Labs, as well as other relevant voices from the collective) on the list of questions/dimensions that any successful proposal (for a revenue model) must address. In other words, what elements it should include and what limitations exist.Some examples of things to consider. The proposed model should:Be executable even if the sequencer fees go to 0.Respect theWorking Constitutionand the guiding principles of theLaw of Chains.Be compatible with the protection of user rights and the security of funds from a technical perspective.Operate under a four-pillar design philosophy of simplicity, pragmatism, sustainability, and optimism.Contribute to scale Ethereum technology and values & build an internet that benefits all, and is owned by all.Do you have any additional considerations that I haven’t mentioned? What is the frame of reference that we cannot forget? What prior agreements should not be modified?cc.@GFXlabs@Gonna.eth@MattL@AnthiasLabs@ccerv1@SEEDGov@LuukDAO@systemIn conclusion, I hope you see this as an invitation to delve deeper into this conversation in a structured manner, with the confidence that we can continue to innovate in how we add value to the ecosystem sustainably over time.If there is a previous thread or a better channel for this, I apologize for my ignorance. I remain attentive and at your disposal."
Season 6: Intents Ratification,"Special thanks to@ceresstation,@GFXlabs,@Gonna.eth,@jackanorak,@kaereste,@Matt/@mastermojo, and@Porter_Smith, for review and feedback of scope changes as part of theFeedback Commission.Season 6: Intentsimage2554×2602 1010 KBContextIn Season 4, we introduced the concept of Intents, or high level strategic goals the entire Collective works towards. InSeason 4 IntentsandSeason 5 Intents, we experimented with having the community set an Intent.As the Collective grows, and Intents apply to the broader Superchain ecosystem, we believe the Foundation has the best insight into the strategic priorities of the broader ecosystem. Therefore,in Season 6, the Foundation will propose all Intents, and they must be ratified by the full Token House.Please note that the Citizens’ House may eventually be involved in the Intents process but will not be in Season 6.The goal continues to be to reduce the Foundation’s role in this process as we bootstrap the infrastructure required for the Intents to be set in a data driven and governance minimized way.Robust data infrastructure and analysis capabilities must be developed to enable the Collective to set Intents. Ideally, this system would allow the Collective to derive something that looks like a KPI tree stemming from a north star metric (ie. network usage) so that Collective Intent setting looks more like a calculation than a subjective brainstorming session. Importantly, the Missions (tactics) to achieve each Intent still remain open to subjectivity and can support moonshot or strategic bets. The thinking on this is open to feedback, iteration, and evolution over time.Furthermore, in Season 6, the Foundation will propose the budgets for each Intent.This is a temporary measure, meant to occur only in Season 6. In Season 5, the Grants Council proposed the Intent Budgets with the intention to transition this responsibility to a Budget Board in the future. The Budget Board won’t be introduced until Season 7 but, given the amount of influence the Grants Council already has in the Token House, we believe it’s more appropriate if the Grants Council doesn’t also propose the Intent Budgets.Please seeSuggested Mission Requestsfor specific examples under each Intent. The Grants Council will continue to process all Mission Requests under these Intents.Intent 1:Progress Towards DecentralizationThe Collective must continue to make progress towards its core value proposition to provide resilient, decentralized, scalable compute. This includes both technical and organizational decentralization – including work to improve fault provability, upgrade processes, governance execution, the development ecosystem, and governance processes of the Collective.This Intent, or a version of, has been Intent#1for three Seasons in a row. It continues to be the Collective’s top priority.Consumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be supported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target governance metric.Target metric, technical: Stage 1 rollup with multiple fault proofs running in productionThis target metric uses L2Beat’s Stage 1 in order to measure the actual properties of the system, rather than measuring inputs (like “add three new core development teams”).Target metric, Token House governance:Increase votable supply by 15% to 100M OPTarget metric, Citizens’ House governance:Increase in the percentage of Citizens that feel confident voting on upgrade vetos (to be measured via the voting UI in each veto proposal)The Collective aims to develop a more comprehensive framework for mapping decentralization beyond just technical properties that may be used in future Seasons.The Foundationis focused on:developing a roadmap towards onchain execution of governance outcomesiterating on the Security Council implementation to bring OP Chains to L2BEAT’sStage 1decentralizationdeveloping thePath to Open Metagovernancedesignincreasing the autonomy of the Citizens’ House, andincreasing votable supply of the OP tokenCore development teamsare focused on implementing:permissionless fault proofs across the Superchainalternate fault proof implementations like Asteriscdelayed protocol upgradeshigh-availability sequencingexpanded core development program of teams contributing to the OP StackRetroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding)will support Intent 1 through Round 5 (OP Stack) and Round 6 (Governance).The Gov Fundis well positioned to support the decentralization of governance processes, including:Critical DAO infrastructure (exampleshere)Rigorous research and analysis on key governance parameters (exampleshere)Driving delegationSee example Mission Requestshere.Proposed Gov Fund Budget: 500k OPPlease note the Gov Fund will not support technical decentralization under Intent#1in Season 6. As the core dev process continues to develop, it is possible the Governance Fund may support these types of technical grants again in the future but, currently it is difficult to ensure a high enough degree of compatibility with core roadmaps.Intent 2: Bring Chains to the SuperchainThe Collective continues to focus on the growth of the Superchain, a network of OP Chains building together. OP Chains on the Superchain contribute revenue back to the Optimism Collective, and share in the Collective’s security, governance-approved upgrades, retroactive public goods funding, and ecosystem support. The complete list of Chains considered to be part of the Superchain is defined in theSuperchain Registry.Our hypothesis is that this strategy will allow the Collective to grow faster, go farther, and scale Ethereum more effectively.Target metric: 20 new chains in the Superchain in the next 6 monthsThis target is set based on our internal deal pipeline.Core development teamswill continue work on highly-requested features from OP Chain operators, including:OP PlasmaInteroperabilityProtocol-enshrined revenue sharingLower transaction latencyEIP 7212Alt-DA IntegrationsCustomizable gas limitsThe Foundationwill continue to grow the Superchain by establishing Superchain governance processes, making grants through the Partner Fund to OP Chains, and through refining core Superchain branding & marketing.Retro Fundingnow includes all chains on the Superchain as of April 2024, which are in scope for upcoming rounds in 2024. In particular, Round 7 (Dev Tooling) supports essential infra and tooling for OP Chain growth.The Gov Fundwill not directly support this Intent, as it requires high touch negotiations with well-established partnersThe scope forAirdropsin Season 6 will include chains in the Superchain beyond just OP Mainnet as timing and data infrastructure allow.Intent 3: Grow application devs on the SuperchainIn addition to bringing new chains to the Superchain, the Collective also aims to grow application developers across all OP Chains in the Superchain.Developer growth and consumer growth are two parts of the flywheel that drive network usage for the Collective. But rather than focus on consumer growth in Season 6, Optimism is focused on developer growth – bootstrapping the supply side of this market to support developers across the globe in building valuable, demand-generating applications on any OP Chain in the Superchain.Consumer facing applications, education initiatives, and/or events may be supported by this Intent, in so far as they contribute to the target metric.Target metric: 9,500 active developers driving network usage (link) relative to 6,800 now.This metric is based on projected and targeted market share.Core development teamsare working on the Superchain Dev Console to support app devs across the Superchain, which will continue to grow to include paymaster functionality, ecosystem integrations, and more.The Foundationwill support Intent#3through infrastructure partnerships for app developers and experiments around identity infrastructure. It will also develop and fund vertical-specific growth campaigns (like WLTA).Retro Fundingsupports this Intent through Round 4 (Onchain Builders), Round 7: (Dev Tooling)The Gov Fundsupports this Intent in two ways:The Grants Council will be responsible for processing Mission grants for builders OP Mainnet.  See example Mission Requestshere.OP Chains may also apply to the Gov Fund to support builders via their own chain-specific grant programs. See full details in the corresponding Mission Requesthere.Proposed Gov Fund Budget: 18M OP (3A + 3B)Intent 3A: 6M OP for grants supporting OP MainnetIntent 3B: 12M OP for chain-specific grant programs supporting the Superchain (to be run by these Chains)."
Collective Intents: Season 5,"Collective Intentsimage3432×2602 1.56 MBIntent 1: Progress towards technical decentralizationThe Optimism Collective must continue to make progress on its core value proposition to provide resilient, decentralized, scalable compute.Last Season, the Bedrock upgrade marked a significant step in modularizing our proof systems, paving a path forward to multiple proof schemes. As a result of the commitment to Bedrock, OP Labs has made steady progress towards a fault proof alpha program on testnet. Besides OP Labs, this has enabled teams at RiscZero and O(1) Labs to take on Foundation Mission Requests targeted at research implementations of zero-knowledge provers for the Collective. Client implementations like op-reth, op-nethermind, and op-erigon continue to make steady progress. Governance is reviewing proposals to implement a Security Council that enacts upgrades for OP Mainnet and the Superchain.The Collective will continue to prioritize this work in the next Season; this Intent continues to be the Collective’s highest priority.Collective Measurements“Stage” of technical decentralizationClient implementation diversityHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent#1:The Governance Fund will support this Intent in a limited capacity:While this Intent continues to be the Collective’s highest priority, many of the projects that support progress towards technical decentralization require high context and specific expertise.This work will be reflected primarily in Foundation Mission Requests and ongoing core development work by community teams like OP Labs, Coinbase, RiscZero and O(1) Labs.Please note, Missions or other grants from the Governance Fund in support of Intent#1will be subject to review by theDeveloper Advisory Board, if approved.Examples of * Delegate Mission Requests:Research on redundant or decentralized sequencingTooling to enable circumventing a faulty sequencerContributions that increase the availability of technical supportAuditing services for grant recipientsFault detection and security monitoringAttestations of onchain smart contracts with github commit informationUpgrade diffing, validation and transparency of their impactsChain SLA monitoring based on the Law of ChainsContributions that increase transparency into revenue shareContributions focused on governance security (anti-sybil attacks, etc.)Intent 2: Grow the SuperchainOver the past year, Optimism has seen an exciting amount of ecosystem growth across many different verticals and communities, and across both OP Mainnet and OP Chains.In Season 5, the Collective will focus on developer growth across the Superchain. Crypto is closer than ever to reaching its full potential, and it’s the Collective’s responsibility to create the conditions for developers around the globe to keep working towards a new version of the internet that puts power in the hands of people.As Optimism expands and the Superchain grows, this Collective Intent is targeted at developer growth across the entire Collective: we care about developers deploying new applications on OP Mainnet; teams or ecosystems adding new OP Chains to the Superchain; and the growth of new and existing OP Chains.Collective MeasurementsActive Builders on the Superchain, defined as:Unique contract deployers across all OP ChainsUnique contract deployers of contracts with interaction from >50 unique addressesHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent#2:The Governance Fund will support this Intent in a limited capacity:The Governance Fund should focus on Mission Requests and/or grants that advance developer growth on OP Mainnet. The Governance Fund should not focus on grants to grow other specific OP Chain ecosystems.The Governance Fund may support projects that support developer experience on OP Mainnet and across the Superchain.The Governance Fund is a small, finite supply of tokens intended to bootstrap the Collective as it evolves to be supported primarily via retroPGF; RetroPGF, along with other mechanisms, is better suited to support the growth of other individual OP Chain ecosystems.Examples of * Delegate Mission Requests:Builder and/or growth incentive grants for projects deploying on OP MainnetInteroperability researchDeveloper tooling that improves users’ ability to build, test, and deploy applicationsContributions that improve wallet, block explorer, RPC, or other dev-centric product integrationsContributions that support development and adoption of account abstraction walletsFrontends to increase access to Optimism’s canonical bridge contractsIntent 3: Improve the Consumer ExperienceIntent#3has been set by Token House delegates, with the help of Simona Pop.To onboard more users to the Optimism network, we must make it easier to engage with practical use cases. This improvement will be vital in expanding our reach and impact.Collective MeasurementsNumber of new wallet addresses with a verified anti-sybil checkNumber of repeat transactions from new addressesNumber of transactions from new addresses that occur via non-DeFi applicationsHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent#3:Intent#3will be primarily supported by the Governance Fund.Example * Delegate Mission Requests:Development of practical use cases covering areas like gaming, encrypted on-chain data ownership for companies and individuals, digital identity, ZK application infrastructure, social applications, and remittance/transfer infrastructure.Experience enhancements that may include fiat on/off ramps, UX improvements (e.g., EIP 6551 and EIP 4337), web2 profile import to web3 profiles, and innovations that streamline on-chain activities.Intent 4: Improve governance accessibilityOptimism Governance decides on protocol upgrades, allocates the token treasury, and stewards Collective profit. Optimism’s two-house system is designed to create healthy checks and balances and expand ownership to a diverse set of governance participants. For more on the scope and responsibilities of Optimism’s governance system, see theFuture of Optimism Governance.The Collective must prioritize accessibility in order to create governance structures that welcome a broad range of Optimists to participate. “Accessibility” includes enabling a diversity of perspectives to participate in governance, facilitating better knowledge sharing to develop more informed voters, and lowering barriers to participation for more culturally diverse involvement in the governance process. Increasing the votable supply and reducing the concentration of voting power are important byproducts of improved accessibility.Collective MeasurementsDelegated supply of OPAverage OP voted per governance proposalHow the Governance Fund Supports Intent#4:The Governance Fund will support the majority of Mission Requests that advance this Intent.Examples of * Delegate Mission Requests:Contributions that educate the broader community about Optimism governance and RetroPGFContributions that increase the resiliency of core governance infrastructureUser friendly interfaces to interact with governance programsContributions that promote and maintain a welcoming governance communityContributions that increase the understandability of the governance system for new entrantsContributions that create transparency and accountability for grant recipients and governance participants*Delegate Mission Requests are approved by the Token House and supported by grants from the Governance Fund. The Foundation also creates Mission Requests under each Intent, which you can viewhere.What Does this Mean for Delegates?During the Reflection Period, delegates will set Intent#3, as described above. Delegates will vote on Intent Budgets, proposed by the elected Grants Council Lead, in Special Voting Cyce#16b."

Superchain Product Vision,"Superchain Product VisionLasted Updated October 8, 2024 This is a living document.Optimism is here to scale Ethereum technology and values & build an internet that benefits all, and is owned by all.No matter what happens to the market, it’s core to Optimism’s identity and strategy that we remain decentralized, open source, and focused on scaling.The Superchain is a network of chains/platforms, each with its own sovereignty, yet all united by Optimism Governance. That means Optimism’s core customer is the platform developer – businesses or projects deploying OP Chains to build their own ecosystems, and by extension their customers - application developers and end users. A scaled Ethereum - trillions in GDP, billions of users, and millions of developers - requires some core principles to outline the product the Optimism Collective is building together.This is the Foundation’s vision for the Superchain over the next two years. Executing on this vision will require collaboration among all of the Collective’s contributors.Standardization of chains enables decentralization and composability at scaleChains benefit from shared governance of upgrades and securityAll chains areStage 2, free from control by any one actor, and all upgrade keys are managed by governanceChains cancustomize non-protocol featuressuch as fee marginsThe Superchain starts as 15-50 chains that feel like one, and scales to 1000+Every transaction is sub-second and sub-centPlatform ecosystems can scale by launching multiple chainsIndividual chains are abstracted away to enable seamless UXGovernance protects the security of the SuperchainGovernance ensures the safety of user funds and liveness of each OP Chain in the SuperchainVoting is legitimate, capture resistant, and representative of the Collective’s primary stakeholders – decisions are made with input by those who are impacted by themStage 2 ensures every individual user’s right to exit Optimism-governed blockspaceGovernance creates a flywheel of sustainable growth and developmentGovernance incentivizes the development and maintenance of public goods that benefit all OP Chains, application developers, or usersGovernance supports the growth of the Superchain economy, and makes sustainable economy policy decisions such as inflation and resource allocationGovernance protects the Collective against rent-seeking and other extractive business modelsSpecial thanks to members of theCollective Feedback Commissionfor review and valuable feedback on early drafts of this document."
Governance Weekly Recap,"Hi all - duncand fromBoardroomherePart of our team’s mission is to increase informed participation in governance, and as a project supporting Optimism voters we thought it would be useful to provide a weekly recap of recent governance activity in the Optimism community. While the Foundation releases a fantastic generalweekly recap, we feel a governance-focused summary will be useful for delegates and voters due to the rapid pace of governance news and updates. When appropriate we’ll also note a few specific areas for action on timely subjects.Within our weekly recap, we’ll provide a look back at:ProposalsGovernance changesImpactful operating suggestions, andCritical governance-related discussions across Discourse, Twitter, and Discord.The recap is intended to provide an overview of what’s happening in governance and easy access to the most critical information—so that it’s easy to stay up-to-date and make informed decisions.The first recap will be posted today.

Data and Analytics Tooling for OP Mainnet and the Superchain,"Hello all. We’re Token Flow, a data and analytics company that participated in RFG 1 of Season 4 (Onchain Data Tools & UI).UpdateOur proposal was to build tools to allow the community to analyze the full history of smart contracts on OP Mainnet through an Explorer and Data Platform.This functionality is now available to the community in two ways:Token Flow StudioStudio is a UI that replaces the envisaged explorer with a SQL editor that allows users to create much more flexible queries, charts and boards using decoded datasets for all blocks, transactions, events and calls from genesis onwards.Users can see the whole history of a contract, or search by address, transaction, block and many other parameters.In addition to OP Mainnet, also Base, Blast, Manta, Mint, Mode, Syndicate-Frame and Zora have been added to Studio outside the grant, with more Superchain and OP Stack L2s and L3s being added.Studio goes beyond what was originally envisaged with Explorer and APIs, and allows core teams and the wider community to conduct and share analysis at the cross-chain, chain, contract, or multi-contract level.Examples are shown below using OP Mainnet and Mode data (in progress):Cross chainState of SuperchainChainState of OptimismState of ModeProtocol / ContractEtherFi on ModeBMX perps on ModeMulti-protocol / contractDEXs on ModePerps competition on ModeA free plan is available to core teams, analysts and community members for non-commercial uses. The free plan is rate and query speed limited. Higher performance paid plans may also be offered in the future.Token Flow Data PlatformOP Mainnet blocks, transactions, events and calls are also available as full datasets via Snowflake in our Data Platform.Given how granular they are, these datasets are huge. For OP Mainnet and the OP Stack chains listed above, we have processed and host over 34 billion rows and 4.07 terrabytes of data (as at early September 2024).A free plan is available for non-commercial and non-redistribution use for OP Mainnet data (no charges from Token Flow, but Snowflake does charge computation cost). Other OP Stack chains are available on request.By sharing in this way users only pay for their own computation from conducting analysis, and Token Flow pays for storage.How to get startedStudiocan be accessedhere, and anyone can create an account. Once you have your account you can start a new query (which can then be added to a board), deciding whether you want it to be public or private. In the left side menu you will see Optimism Mainnet and all the other available chains (circled in red):Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 18.39.111920×873 122 KBForData Platformyou can contact us using the “get more info” formhereand we will discuss with you what is available and how the data is shared via Snowflake.For these products, and our others, you can find additionalinformation and supporthere:Documentation:https://docs.tokenflow.live/Support channel (and support bot) in our Discord server (link from docs or homepage - can only add 10 links here in a forum post).Want your OP Stack chain added?If you are an OP Stack chain that we don’t yet cover and you want to be added to Studio get in contact with us - typically we can add newer L2s/L3s within days.Our thanksWe thank the community and grants committee for supporting the inclusion of OP Mainnet data in these two products, and are happy to make them available to the ecosystem.Thanks also to the Grants Committee and the Milestones and Metrics Sub-Committee for their constructive approach in the amendment in how we delivered the functionality (e.g. Studio with broader capabilities rather than Explorer with more narrow abilities). (Tagging@PGovfor visibility).We encourage the community to try out Studio, and those with more intensive data needs to contact us about Data Platform access. If you have feedback or feature requests let us know via the support bot in our Discord server.We look forward to seeing what you build!"

Foundation Year 3 Budget Update,"SummaryThe Optimism Foundation’s operating budget of OP, subject to governance approval by the Token House, maintains the original budget set into motion in both Year 1 and Year 2 proposals.For this year’s operating budget, The Foundation is requesting zero additional OPand will continue deploying existing allocations against key initiatives across the Collective.There will not be a Token House vote on this budget as no OP is being requested.BackgroundThe Optimism Foundation administers a portion of the token supply to further the Collective’s goals. This set of tokens is referred to as the “Foundation Budget,” which must be utilized in line with overall OP Token Allocations.The primary operating budget for Year 2 (June 2023 - May 2024) carried over from the initial OP token allocation at thefounding of the Collectiveon April 24, 2022. In 2023, an additional 1 OP was requested (symbolically) towards Year 2’s budget as a means to initiate the Token House for future budget approvals. We received feedback from delegates that they did not like the symbolic vote and are therefore providing transparency into the budget for 2024 but will not initiate a symbolic vote.Overall OP AllocationsThe overall ecosystem allocations of the total initial supply of OP (as outlined in thegovernance documentation) are as follows:858,993,459 OP(20%) to Retroactive Public Goods Funding1,073,741,824 OP(25%) to Ecosystem Fund (Governance Fund, Partner Fund, Seed Fund, Unallocated)816,043,786 OP(19%) to User Airdrops810,329,332 OP(19%) to Core Contributors735,858,894OP(17%) to Sugar XaddiesIn April 2022, 30% of the total initial token supply was made available to the Foundation for administration in line with the overall token allocations detailed above. In utilizing these tokens, the Foundation may not exceed 30% of the total supply, and may not exceed any individual category’s allocation limit.Budget UpdateTotal Token SupplyThe current circulating supply of OP, as well as a breakdown in each category, is maintained in the public OP Token Unlock trackerhere 28.As of 30 April 2024, token supply is as follows:CategoryTotal OP CirculatingTotal OP CommittedTotal OP Allocated% of total supplyGovernance Fund60,801,15276,297,219231,928,2345.4%Partner Fund, Seed Fund, Unallocated55,153,657484,674,162841,813,5905.4%+5.4%+8.8%Airdrops256,245,713256,245,713816,043,78619.0%RPGF32,546,81440,000,000858,993,45920.0%Early Core Contributors329,543,520712,140,140810,329,33218.9%Sugar Xaddies352,599,107735,858,894735,858,89417.1%Cumulative Total1,086,889,9632,305,216,1284,294,967,296100%% Relative to Fully Diluted Supply25.3%53.7%Foundation BudgetIn Year 2 (April 20, 2023 → April 19, 2024), the Foundation fueled the growth of the Collective by specifically focusing on giving out tokens from the Ecosystem Fund, Airdrops, as well as Retro Funding. The below showcases percentage changes since November 2023 (our prior mid-year update), where we first introduced accounting for both “circulating” OP and “committed” OP (defined in “Accounting Notes” below).To increase clarity going forward, we will provide year-over-year comparisons in the future.

The amount in the ‘Unallocated’ bucket has been reduced by ~17.3M tokens, to 46.9M, to account for these tokens as “Committed” rather than “Circulating.”Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth for simplicity. As a result, exact calculations based on these percentages may not match precisely.“Circulating” refers to tokens with no known restrictions on sale or transfer.“Committed” refers to (1) OP tokens that have been granted subject to a lock-up + (2) all OP tokens that have been conditionally committed subject to vesting or completing milestones.Ecosystem GrowthOver the past year, Foundation tokens have been used to secure a variety of partnerships, bootstrapping the Superchain with a focus on bringing more L2s and tooling into the Collective. We had the opportunity to welcome some of the most prominent names in the space, including Base, Zora, Redstone, Frax, Celo, Worldcoin, Mode, and Lisk, all launching their own L2 blockspace built on the OP Stack.In addition, with a goal of reducing chain deployment friction, we set out to establish key infrastructure teams within the Superchain to help improve developer onramp experience. Notable groups like Blockscout, Chainlink, Safe, Gelato, and Conduit, just to name a few, joined as contributors to the cause.AirdropsThe Foundation successfully initiatedAirdrop #3(Sept 2023) andAirdrop #4(Feb 2024), delivering a total of 29,755,070.81 OP between the two.

Costa Rica OP DAY,"OPtimism Governance Day: Spreading Optimism in Costa RicaFebruary 15th, 2024marked a special day for the Optimism community in Costa Rica, as InBest hosted our first ever OP Day event. The event, themed around love and friendship in the spirit of Valentine’s Day, was a huge success, with over 50 attendees eager to learn more about Optimism and its potential to revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem.dia-optimista1080×1080 127 KBObjectives and SignificanceThe primary goal of the OP Day event was to spread awareness and adoption of Optimism technology in Costa Rica. We wanted to introduce the community to Optimism’s unique features, such as its fast and low-cost transactions, and its robust governance model.This event was particularly significant because it marked several important milestones:2024-03-10 10.26.051280×1280 135 KBFirst OP Day event in Costa Rica:This event set a precedent for future OP-related gatherings in the country, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among enthusiasts.Launch of Inbest as an Optimism Governance Delegate:Inbest, a key player in the Costa Rican blockchain scene, officially assumed the role of an Optimism Governance Delegate, further strengthening the country’s representation in the Optimism ecosystem.Introduced the community to OP Governance and Gov Forum:Project Launches on Optimism:The event showcased two exciting projects that are deploying on Optimism:CheckMyTicket:A ticketing platform that leverages NFTs to create a unique and secure experience. The event’s tickets were the first step for this project on Optimism, and Roberto, the project’s lead, shared his vision and experiences with the audience.Contract: 0xb88239464D489F928d71edb7872E997558006AACCriptoCantina:An initiative by Asoblockchain that brings together blockchain enthusiasts in Costa Rica. The OP Day event was organized in collaboration with CriptoCantina, allowing us to present the Optimism ecosystem to its members, they have been hosting blockchain events in costa rica for yearsEvent HighlightsThe event featured a lineup of engaging speakers, each sharing their insights and expertise on various aspects of Optimism:Karla, Luis, Gonzalo, and Roxana:Members of the CriptoCantina community who played a crucial role in organizing the event.Alfredo:A developer transitioning from Web2 to Web3 and helping others make the same move. He presented on the opportunities and jobs available in Web3, emphasizing the importance of hackathons.Daniel:A full-time Web3 developer with extensive experience. He shared his experiences as a digital nomad, his participation in hackathons, and the importance of open-source code.Ana:Superpuesta, a traditional artist that is on her journey of migrating to the blockchain digital art, and a participant on the WELOVETHEART❤️ she attended our event and talked about her experience with others.Learn-to-EarnThe OP Day event was designed with a “learn-to-earn” approach in mind, incentivizing attendees to actively engage and learn about Optimism. Here’s how it worked:Attendees had to possess the event’s NFT ticket.They validated their attendance by scanning their NFT with the CheckMyTicket app.Throughout the presentations, attendees were encouraged to prepare for a game at the end.Questions about Optimism were written on red hearts, and attendees randomly selected a heart.If they answered the question correctly, they wrote their name on the heart and placed it in a raffle box.The more questions answered correctly, the more entries in the raffle box.A winner was randomly selected - congratulations to Julieth!

Here’s a brief overview of the event’s outcomes:Date:Thursday, February 15thAttendees:~50 peopleVenue Size:SmallMarketing:1 Instagram Reel and manual promotionKey Learnings and Looking Ahead:PD:thanks to this event we got invited to an OnlyDust meeting and we will talk about Optimism Grants and web3 opportunities for devs on the OP Ecosistem.The OP Day served as a valuable test run for future events. Here are some key takeaways:Enhanced Marketing Strategy:We’ll develop a more in-depth marketing campaign for the next event. This will include at least 3 videos released weeks in advance, focusing on both Instagram and LinkedIn to target new users. While Twitter is great for existing users, these other platforms will help us reach a wider audience.Wallet Education:Not all attendees minted NFTs using their own crypto wallets. We’ll incorporate educational resources to encourage attendees to create their own wallets and become more comfortable navigating the Web3 space.NFT Interaction:Only 10 Confirmed NFTs were minted (team and organizers excluded) this means that from all 50 attendees, only 10 actually were able to or felt motivated enough to go trough the whole process of claiming the NFT, scanning it to validate it and then getting the confirmed optimist NFT. Thats a 20%Learn to Earn Success:The “Learn to Earn” format proved highly successful in making the event engaging and interactive. We’ll continue to utilize this approach in future events.Tailored Content:This event catered to both users and builders with a broad introduction to the Optimism ecosystem. To delve deeper into specific aspects, we might consider separating content for future events or introducing a two-phase structure. This would allow us to focus on user-friendly content initially, followed by more technical topics. The goal is to ensure all attendees, regardless of experience level, can gain valuable insights.TOP 100 delegate:To significantly enhance the quality and information we deliver at our events, we’d greatly benefit from insights and support from a leading delegate or someone passionate about contributing and making an impact.OP Grants and Mission Requests are relatively new concepts, and the ever-evolving OP Governance structure with new councils and positions can be challenging to navigate. The expertise of an experienced delegate would provide invaluable clarity and education for our community.With these learnings in mind, if we managed to achieve this with just one promo video posted 5 days before the event and by manual invitation, we’re aiming for an attendance of over 100 people and a larger venue for the next OP Day! Stay tuned, Costa Rica! ️The Optimism ecosystem is rapidly growing, with a diverse range of dApps and projects.There are numerous opportunities for developers and enthusiasts to get involved in the Optimism ecosystem.Moving ForwardThe OP Day event has laid the foundation for a thriving Optimism community in Costa Rica. We are excited to build on this momentum and continue spreading awareness and adoption of Optimism technology. We encourage everyone interested in Optimism to join our community and contribute to its growth with knowledge and information.Special ThanksWe would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who contributed to the success of the OP Day event and a special thanks to CryptoCosi (MariFer), part of the InBest team, was responsible for all the decorations, stickers, and hearts for the game and learn-to-earn activities."

Dark Forest ARES: Milestone 2 Submission and request for feedback,"GM optimism!On behalf of the DFArchon team, I am excited to announcement that we have reached Milestone 2 ofDark Forest ARESproject, which received anOP grant in Season 5, Cycle 22.In this post, we outline our achievements and the upcoming steps.  We encourage everyone, especially those interested in innovative game mechanics, to join our community, try out the game, and share your feedback.What is Dark Forest ARES & DFAres v0.1 Round 4?Dark Forest ARES is a community-run development of Dark Forest. We periodically conduct development and game testing activities, experimenting with innovative game mechanics and gathering feedback from real players.Dark Forest Ares v0.1 Round 4 game screenshot1920×1015 457 KBFrom June to August 2024, we worked on the development of DFAres  v0.1 Round 4. In August, we held a six-day DFAres v0.1 Round 4 game event on the Redstone mainnet. Players have submitted over 182,680 transactions in total.What we deliveredWe updated the ZK circuits to support the controllable distribution of resources within the universe.This allows for higher planet levels for planets closer to the center of the universe without revealing the specific coordinates of planets, thereby shaping the players’ game objectives.We introduced inner radius by modifying the ZK circuits.Players can only operate in the universe space outside the inner radius. The value of the inner radius starts off large and gradually decreases to zero as the game progresses. This adjustment helps regulate the game’s pace, ensuring that all players advance towards the center of the universe at a consistent rate, thereby promoting balance within the game.We published two very detailed technical analysis articles:Modifications to Fog of War in Dark Forestmirror.xyzModifications to Fog of War in Dark ForestAuthor: calex & ddyThis article details our exploration and considerations for adjusting ZK circuits for game balance in Dark Forest Ares.

"Namespace - Builder Grant Update (Season 5, Cycle 19)","GM Optimists, I’m Cap, the founder ofNamespace. I’m writing to report on our progress and show what we’ve done so far.We received an OP Grant fromSeason 5, Cycle 19, to scale ENS to OP and enable easy ENS Subname integration for other projects and dapps on OP.Feedback is appreciated and possibly some devs using and testing our infrastructure for minting and managing Subnames on OP.Namespace introIn a nutshell, Namespace helps teams and individuals to easily integrate ENS into their dapps, and start issuing .eth names or subnames to their users / community. We build dev tools for developers and a user-friend app (app.namespace.tech) for individual ENS name owners, to easily issue Subnames. Namespace is also one of the 9 official ENS Service Providers taking the lead on partnerships, integrations, and building tools and apps that help streamline ENS adoption!Proposal SummaryThe goal of the project is to enable minting ENS subnames on Optimism with Fault proof verification. This is achieved by utilizing the CCIP protocol, which allows storing ENS subnames and records on L2 chains. The chains are resolved through an offchain gateway application, which verifies the stored data. Furthermore with the introduction of the EVM Gateway by ENS, the data can be stored and verified trustlessly, meaning that the Gateway cannot manipulate the data.Milestones overviewIntegrate CCIP (EVM Gateway)Deploy Minting and Listing contracts on OP2.1 Testnet2.2 MainnetAuditWrite developer documentation for easy integrationIntegrate new OP Contracts with the Namespace platform(only testnet)Completion, User Testing User adoption + Feedback loop for improvementLaunch the code and initiate OP expansionMilestone 1The overview of the architecture that outlines the implementation of the CCIP protocol using the EVM Gateway and fault proofs:1600×962 197 KBIn the CCIP architecture the clients, such as wallets, need to be able to support CCIP, which requires handling the callback response from the resolver contract. For our project, we have implemented the OpVerifierResolver contract using the EVM Verifier fromUnruggableby@nxt3d. We have also utilized thegateway libraryfrom Unruggable in order to fetch L2 proofs. Once the proofs are passed back to the client, the client will make the callback call back to OpVerifierResolver and get the verified result.Milestone 2Use case for listing and mintingopsubs.ethsubnames on Optimism Sepolia, and resolving subnames on L1 Sepolia.L1 Contracts deployed on SepoliaOPFaultVerifier(contains the link to the EVM Gateway and helps with constructing the request for storage slots on OP)OpVerfierResolver(the resolver contract which references OPFaultVerifier)Minting and listingopsubs.ethlistedon Optimism Sepoliamysub.opsubs.ethmintedon Optimism Sepolia, also setting theaddress recordThe resolver updated with theOpVerifierResolver addressTheaddress recordnow resolves to the address set in the second step above, utilizing the CCIP resolution process, which allows the client to call the gateway to fetch the verifiable data from L2.1267×626 147 KBMilestone 3We are in the process of hiring an auditing company to audit our implementation for minting subnames on Optimism and Base.Milestone 4We have started writing developer documentation for our SDK. The SDK is a TypeScript library built to simplify the integration of ENS Subname registrations into Web3 projects. It provides developers with a simple way to interact with Namespace’s backend APIs and smart contracts.The primary intention for the SDK is to streamline the ENS integration and Subname issuance on different L2 chains (Base, Optimism, etc.).You can read more about it on our officialNamespace Docs.Milestone 5Currently, we are refactoring our backend to create new endpoints just for listing and minting subnames on the Namespace app (app.namespace.tech), configured through the Manager, which will include both our existing L1 subname functionality, as well adding the support for L2 subnames.AsksWe’d love to have some builders integrate ENS into their dapps and issue Subnames on OP for their users / community.If interested, please join ourNamespace DevTG group for convenience, assistance, and vibes.Contact infoCap: TG or Twitter:@thecaphimselfNamespaceWebsite:https://www.namespace.tech/Docs:https://docs.namespace.tech/Github:Namespace · GitHubX:x.comFarcaster:Warpcastaccount orWarpcastchannel"

About the Governance  Design 📐 category,"This category is for the Collective’s metagovernance strategy!Initiatives like the Path to Metagov, Collective Feedback Commission, and programs likes the Chain Delegation Program live here.Metagovernance is governance of the governance system, so this category pertains to the design of how the Collective governs the governance system."
The Collective Feedback Commission: The Next Iteration,"Collective Feedback Commission: The Next IterationThe Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) was piloted beginning in Season 5 as part of thepath to open metagovernance.As outlined in the Collective’sWorking Constitution, the Foundation’s role is to bootstrap the governance system of the Collective over multiple years, gradually bringing more governance rights online until the system can manage itself.  Metagovernance refers to the ability to propose changes to the design of the governance system. Given the importance of this responsibility, metagovernance is the last governance responsibility that will be transferred to the community.The CFC serves as an experimental training ground to develop a “Core Governance Program” that will allow the Collective to take on metagovernance responsibilities in the future. The inspiration for this program is Core Development Programs. The goal of the CFC is to enable the Foundation to become just one of many Core Governors proposing metagovernance proposals in the future (similar to how OP Labs is just one of many Core Developers proposing protocol upgrades.)This will require a multi-year, gradual, and iterative process. The CFC began with an initial six month pilot in which members were primarily “consulting the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.” You can see the full pilot retrospectivehere.Based on the impact of the pilot, the Foundation has decided to continue iterating with the CFC. Iterations of the Commission will gradually increase the set of member responsibilities over time as well as increase the number of members the Commission can support.The next iteration of the Commission will launch on November 4th. Qualifying participants will be notified by October 28th and will be required to opt-in and KYC by November 1st.Please note that while we will continue the Commission, we will be postponing the launch of the open contribution path component until we have further refined the best format to accomplish the longer term goals of the Commission. It is one full workstream to design how the Commission works and another workstream to create the contribution path that supports it. We are still committed to supporting this path in the future, but need to focus our efforts on the refinement and development of the core workstream first.We will continue to invest in the many opportunities outside the Commission for the broader community to provide feedback to the Foundation.image_with_white_background_22048×499 53.2 KBSeason 7 Collective Feedback Commission CharterSeason 7 CFC GoalsThe next iteration of the CFC will begin on November 4th and run through the end of Season 7.Goals:Allow members to gain more insight into the Foundation’s approach to governance design, building shared context aroundthe how and whyCreate a more collaborative working process between the Foundation and the Commission, involving Commission members in the earlier stages of our design process:planning and researchAllow for member specialization based on level and type of expertise, accomplished via the distinct tracks outlined belowAllow members to have more agency over lower stakes design parametersNon-goals:The pilot made it obvious that we need to further refine the Foundation’s working relationship with the CFC before we can ask members to develop the lower levels of the contribution path and mentor new participants. We are still committed to the development of this contribution path in the future and would recommend joining the govNERDS contribution path to build up relevant knowledge and skills in the meantime (join the wannabe-govnerds channel in Discord for more info!)As always, after each version, there will be a participant survey and retrospective workshop to inform the next iteration. You can find the pilot retrospectivehere.Season 7 CFC Structureimage_with_white_background2048×1204 136 KBParticipantsThe Collective Feedback Commission will be split into three different tracks to allow for different levels of engagement and to accommodate different types of expertise.Optimization: Members will refine, optimize, and adapt existing processes or programs they have first hand experience withOperational (Governance Processes)Focus areas: Token House Process, Citizens’ House Process, User TestingMembership: 3 members; based on demonstrable knowledge of processesFoundation Track Lead:@op_julianExpected Hours per month: Up to ~3Level of agency:Write accessInformed about Organizational work; attends all Commission meetingsOrganizational (Governance Structures)Focus areas: Onboarding Flows, Autonomous Operations, Evolving MandatesMembership: 5 members; All Council, Board, and Commission LeadsFoundation Track Lead:@maxwellExpected Hours per month: Up to ~5Level of agency:Edit accessInformed about System Design work; attends select Foundation meetingsDesign Research: Members will work directly with the Foundation via “Project Partnerships,” supporting the Foundation in one of the earlierst stages of the design process: ResearchFocus areas: Research, Evaluation Algorithms, Selection Algorithms, Voting Design, DecentralizationMembership: Up to 10 members; based on demonstrable expertiseFoundation Track Lead:@lavandeExpected Hours per month: Up to ~8Level of agency:Read + research accessWork directly with the Foundation team via “Project Partnerships”Each track will have a Foundation Lead. Simona Pop, a Foundation Advisor, will serve as the Commission Lead. Foundation Leads will facilitate context sharing between the Commission and the Foundation. The Commission Lead will manage Commission operations and hold the Foundation accountable to executing on this Charter.*There will be 18 eligible members. Qualification of members will based on demonstrable contributions/attestations relevant to each area of required expertise. All members must opt-in to participate. The full list will be added as a comment to this post on October 25th. The CFC is an experiment and membership models are subject to change with each iteration.We will continue to invest in the many opportunities outside the Commission for the broader community to provide feedback to the Foundation.Note: Pilot membership was determined via delegation rankings in the Token House and via demonstrable contributions in the Citizens’ House. This led to a high degree of overlap between members of the CFC and other leadership roles in the Collective. The current iteration experiments with selection based on expertise. We are likely to continue experimenting with different selection methods in future iterations.Season 7 ResponsibilitiesIndividual members of the Collective Feedback Commission will:Provide feedback on early Foundation design drafts, roadmaps, frameworks, etc.Participate in broader design discussions with the Foundation via monthly meetingsProvide feedback on community authored Mission Requests to ensure they align with Season 7 Intents and/or other strategic initiativesExecute on contributions as scoped by the Foundation (members of the Design Research track will do this via Project Partnerships)Note: The Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as an input but is not obligated to incorporate any individual piece of feedback or implement the recommendations in any contribution. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission members, and may be made publicly viewable by the entire community at the end of the Commission’s term. The Foundation will provide summaries of the impact of all contributions.Foundation Track Leads will:To the best of our ability, request feedback on regular feedback cycles. Project Partnerships will be scoped with clear deliverables and deadlines.Host monthly calls with the Foundation governance design team to share context and facilitate a two-way dialogue with Commission members.Propose a selection mechanism that determines which members claim specific pieces of work, subject to simple majority approval by members at the start of the term.The Commission Lead will:Onboard new Commission members, ensuring they are familiar with the CFC’s processes, mission, and operational structure. This includes providing any necessary documentation or training to help them contribute effectively from the start.Propose the evaluation algorithm by which rewards will be distributed to individual members at the start of the term, subject to majority (51%) approval  (see “Rewards” section below).Ensure members of each track are executing on their responsibilities in a timely manner and flag any blockers to execution to the Foundation.Facilitate feedback loops and coordination between Commission members and the Foundation, when needed, holding the Foundation accountable to this Charter.Organize regular Commission meetings, as desired by members. The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization.Authoring, or coordinating authorship, of any regularcommunication reportscirculated to the broader community.Conduct feedback survey, facilitate peer reviews, and host retrospective workshop at the end of the Commission’s term to inform the next iterationNote: Leads are operational roles, meaning they do not engage in the day-to-day activities of the team but rather manage the operations of the team. This means Leads don’t review, vote, or sign but they may exercise decision-making authority in the event that the commission cannot come to consensus on a matter (ie. serve as tie breaker). Leads may also draft any applications for impact evaluation of the Commission, although we don’t expect Retro Funding to be applicable to the Commission’s work in Season 7 (see below.)Season 7 RewardsThe CFC will be allocated 100,000 OP by the Foundation. The Commission Lead will be compensated separately, via an agreement with the Foundation. These tokens will come out of the Unallocated Portion of the treasury, managed by the Foundation, since the CFC provides a valuable service to the Foundation. We are providing these rewards as we believe the work of the Commission is difficult to evaluate retroactively and therefore the CFC’s work should not depend on being eligible for Retro Funding.  Retro Funding is best suited to evaluating measurable and permissionless impact, whereas the Commission’s work is hard to measure and is currently permissioned to members selected by the Foundation. The level of impact generated by the Commission might also be higher or lower in a given season due to factors outside the Commission’s control, such as the Foundation’s experiment design.Members will vote via simple majority to approve an evaluation algorithm, proposed by the Lead at the start of the term, via which rewards will be allocated from this budget at the end of the season.The Lead will calculate individual rewards based on the approved evaluation algorithm at the end of the Season and rewards should be allocated accordingly. The Foundation recommends a minimum 48 hour dispute window to allow members to verify the correct application of the evaluation algorithm before contacting the Foundation to deliver rewards.Season 7 SuccessNumber of new ideas proposed and implemented as a result of Commission input (> 8)% of drafts in which feedback was ranked as “high value” by the Foundation (> 70%)NPS score from Foundation governance team (= > 5/7)The below measures will be used to evaluate the success of the Foundation in managing this program:Member ranking of clarity of role 8.5+ (up from 7.7/10 in v1)Member ranking of clarity of responsibilities 9+ (up from 7.6/10 in v1)Member ranking of Commission efficacy 8.5+ (up from 6.9/10 in v1)"
Optimism Working Models for Decentralization,"Optimism Working Models for DecentralizationIn the recent weeks, the community has started an important conversation about the Collective’s path towards full decentralization. The Foundation remains fully committed to this transition over the course of multiple years, as originally outlined in ourWorking Constitution. We’ve realized that the context gap between the Foundation and the community about this path is too wide. Below, we introduce several working models intended to narrow this gap:Decentralization Milestone Working ModelDecision Diagram Working Model(+Decision Design Framework)These working models are not intended to be roadmaps.There is an inherent trade-off between flexibility and specification. These working models are intended to preserve flexibility, and allow the community to collaborate with us in testing, adapting, and evolving these working models as we learn together. In order to provide more specificity, the Foundation will also publish governance roadmaps at the start of each Season, as part of the Intent setting process. These roadmaps will inform the portions of these working models that are prioritized in the coming Season, and these working models can help contextualize each Season’s roadmaps within the broader system and path towards decentralization.You can expect a Season 7 governance roadmap to be published alongside Season 7 Intents during the Reflection Period. This roadmap will inform the specific portions of the below working models prioritized in Season 7.Decentralization Milestone Working ModelSee thisloomfor a brief overview.Goal:Create a working model that demonstrates the Foundation’s thinking about the major decentralization milestones, their dependencies, and the work necessary to be done to move from one phase to the next. We hope this working model facilitates ongoing conversations about dependencies and better enables the community to contribute to decentralization efforts. It can also serve as a tool to hold the Foundation publicly accountable to making progress towards these milestones.Taking inspiration from L2BEAT’s “stages of decentralization”frameworkfor technical decentralization, this working model outlines the Optimism specific milestones required to achieve full decentralization (protocol, economic, and social). This model also outlines the dependencies and interdependencies preventing progression to the next phase.This is meant to be a working model for understanding the progression of decentralization within the Collective and it should evolve over time with regular discussion.We are about to complete Phase A. Phase C represents the level of maturity in which the Collective is a self-managing system that represents all 4 principles outlined in ourWorking Constitution:Governance minimizationForkabilityAnti-plutocracyImpact = ProfitMilestones will be updated as they are accomplished and we recommend re-evaluating progress towards this framework at the end of each Season. We suggest piloting this process at the end of Season 6 and updating milestones as part of the Season 7 Intent setting process.Please see the model notes and legend for additional information about this working model.Governance Decision Diagram Working ModelSee thisloomfor a brief overview.Goal:Create a working model of the full decision making surface area of Optimism governance, demonstrate how these decisions interrelate, and provide a framework for how these decisions might be designed. This diagram represents the full self-managing system described in Phase C of the decentralization milestone model. It can serve as a tool for governance participants to orient their work within the system and understand the decision making infrastructure required to bring additional responsibilities online.This working model outlines the Foundation’s view of the full governance decision space to be established by Phase C. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is not to make these decisions directly. The goal of the Foundation is to bootstrap the infrastructure and policies required to allow governance participants to effectively make these decisions. We’ve open sourced ourDecision Design Framework, to inform how we approach the design of each decision module within this diagram. At a future date, we may also publish the hypothesis to be tested in the development of each decision module. With this information, we hope that contributors can better aid the Foundation in the metagovernance design of each decision module.This diagram is advisory in nature:  it provides guidance to the community on how the Foundation considers various decision pathways across the Collective, and is intended to inform - but not define - the governance community’s decision-making processes.Please see the model notes and legend for additional information about this working model.Navigating the path towards decentralization requires navigating ambiguity, uncertainty, and dynamic conditions. We hope these working models serve as a tool for the community to understand the Foundation’s approach while allowing for enough flexibility and adaptability to build a system that reflects current realities and that can withstand the test of time.As always, we’re open to your feedback on any and all of the above!"
Looking Ahead: Long-term Onchain Governance Architecture,"Looking ahead: Long-term Onchain Governance ArchitectureWe’re thrilled to share some updates and our vision for the future of onchain governance within our ecosystem. As many of you know, Agora has been instrumental in moving the governance fund onchain, and their upcoming proposal [link when available] marks a significant milestone for us. This move not only aligns with our commitment to transparency and decentralization but also opens up a conversation about the future of onchain governance within our ecosystem.As we navigate this transition, we’re looking ahead at the longer-term future of onchain governance and how it can evolve to better serve our community. Currently, theOperating Manualserves as a robust framework guiding our governance processes. Translating its full functionality onchain presents challenges and opportunities that we believe are crucial to address in the open.Proposal Permissioning: Balancing Innovation with PrudenceAs we move the Governance Fund onchain, an important next step to consider is proposal permissioning.Industry Standard vs. Current ModelThe industry standard for onchain governance involves minimal barriers to proposal submissions, relying on token-based thresholds to filter proposals.Our current model, which requires delegate approvals and adheres to voting cycles, offers a more granular system that we believe is crucial for maintaining the quality and relevance of proposals. However, this is enforced at the social layer by the Optimism Foundation—meaning only the OF is authorized to propose onchain, and offchain proposers must trust the OF to post their votes onchain:image2256×1440 137 KBWhy a Direct Move to Permissionless Could be ProblematicMost DAOs use a token-based threshold requirement for permissionless proposal submission to prevent spam or malicious proposals from entering the voting process. A low barrier to entry can lead to an overwhelming number of proposals, many of which may lack substance or relevance to the community’s goals. This not only clutters the governance process but also dilutes the attention and resources that could be directed towards more impactful proposals. The main issue with using minimum token-based thresholds as a filtering mechanism is that it reduces participation relative to our current system (which allows the top 100 delegates to provide approvals) and creates plutocratically-gated proposal rights, which is antithetical to the principles outlined in ourWorking Constitution.Additionally, the industry’s standard proposal structures don’t allow for logic encoded in ourOperating Manual, which protects against common attack vectors including vote buying or borrowing, bribery, non-standard voting periods that can take advantage of voter apathy or advantageous ordering, malicious proposals, etc.While these concerns could be partially mitigated by increasing the token-based thresholds required to propose, this presents a fundamental, plutocratic-favoring tradeoff—the higher the threshold, the less participatory governance can be, and the more “agenda-setting powers” are concentrated into the hands of large token holders. This means that proposal thresholds are an active subject of contention in many other communities, and go against the principle of anti-plutocracy outlined in theWorking Constitutionof the Optimism Collective.Our Vision: A More Granular ApproachAs we consider the future of onchain governance, we believe that we should strive for a system which mirrors the sophistication and nuance of ourOperating Manual. This means creating an onchain governance model that allows for different types of proposals, and for rules and requirements which can be dependent on the specifics of the proposals in question.As an illustrative example, imagine the following:image2912×1728 227 KBWe believe that such a system would not only preserve the integrity of our governance process but also set a new standard for DAOs and onchain communities.Next Steps: Bridging the GapTo achieve this vision, we believe that initial focus should be on replicating the full functionality of theOperating Manualonchain, with a focus on Gov Fund proposals first. This work includes:Delegate Approvals:Implementing the ability to gate proposals on multiple delegate approvals, as currently specified in the Operating Manual, with thresholds not reliant on token-based balances.Voting Cycles:By requiring that proposals are only submitted within [1] day of voting cycles, we can preserve the current cadence of voting cycles specified in the Operating Manual.Type-aware Permissioning:By implementing these rules with an awareness of proposal types, we can incrementally bring permissionless proposals online for additional proposal types.Short-term Open QuestionsWhile the above work is straightforward enough, some questions do remain which we’d like to open up for community discussion:Ossification of Voting Cycles:In the past, we have changed voting cycles’ and seasons’ dates. Moving this onchain opens the question of how to proceed: either we permanently set voting cycles, or introduce a permissioned role which can change them. We propose that, to start, since the Optimism Foundation will retain a veto right over Gov Fund allocations that the Optimism Foundation can just hold this role to start.Additional Size-based Safeguards:One open design question is: are there benefits to implementing more stringent requirements for proposal submissions, such as requiring more delegate approvals for proposals allocating higher amounts of OP? This would be a divergence from the Operating Manual today, but could be appropriate given the transition to permissionlessness.Proposal Edits:How can we accommodate changes to proposals during the review period without compromising the voting process? Is it sufficient to allow arbitrary edits, but have any edits to reset delegate approvals?Future Work: Expanding Our Governance ToolkitLooking ahead, we’re excited about the possibilities of further enhancing our onchain governance architecture, which extends beyond proposal permissioning. We wanted to share what we see as some of the big architectural challenges in the long-term:Onchain Citizens’ House Voting:Integrating Citizens’ House voting directly into our onchain processes, allowing for bringing multi-house decisions fully onchain. While there is some bare-bones work which needs to be done no matter what, we believe that further testing and refinement of the Citizens’ House Veto mechanism is required before we can finalize this architecture.Onchain Citizenship Selection:Allowing for onchain governance to expand the Citizen set over time presents an extremely large design space, with less prior industry work to draw from than token voting systems. Because of how complex this design space is, more experimentation and clarity is needed before any productionization could begin.Emergency Off-cycle Votes: We think the community should consider developing mechanisms for addressing urgent matters outside of the regular voting cycles.Delegation Programs:Moving delegation programs like the Protocol Delegation Program and Chain Delegation Program to onchain mechanisms presents an opportunity to provide stronger guarantees to stakeholders.In conclusion, the move to onchain Gov Fund execution represents a significant milestone for us, but it’s just the beginning. We’re committed to building a governance model that is not only robust and transparent but also flexible and inclusive. We look forward to engaging with the community as we embark on this exciting journey together."
Collective Feedback Commission Pilot Retrospective,"Collective Feedback Commission Pilot RetrospectivePilot Recap6 months ago, we piloted aCollective Feedback Commission(CFC) as the first step in outlining apath towards open metagovernance.  The primary role of the Collective Feedback Commission during this pilot was to formalize a previously informal process of collecting feedback from engaged community members by“consulting the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.”We simultaneously drove efforts to solicit more feedback from the broader community, via polls and open workshops, so that feedback opportunities remain open to anyone and are not restricted to the Commission.We also experimented with additional engagement opportunities, such as asking the Commission to draft Mission Requests under Intent#1:Progress towards decentralization, governance.The Commission was divided into two groups:Token House: provided feedback on early design drafts related to Season 6, vision, and roadmapsCitizens’ House: provided feedback on early design drafts related to Rounds 4-6, vision, and roadmapsYou can see the hub where feedback was provided here [link to be provided shortly], which includes Foundation statements as to how the feedback was incorporated into designs.The Commission is rewarded, in line with Impact Level 4 of theCollective Rewards Framework, but is also eligible to apply to Round 6: Governance.Pilot GoalsOne of the Foundation’s main goals with this pilot was to improve Season/Round designs relative to what we would have designed without Commission input. We can safely say that was accomplished. More concretely, at the start of the pilot, we identified the following measures of success:Number of design parameters we change based on member feedback (goal: > 5)This was actually 30Number of new ideas proposed and implemented (ideas that we hadn’t previously thought of) (goal: > 3)This was actually 8These are imprecise measures. A better metric would have been the percentage of feedback the Foundation ranked as “high value” or an NPS score of the Foundation governance team rating feedback utility.Additional Foundation goals were related to decentralization:Create transparency around an informal process and create objective criteria for participating in this processBegin to create a program to develop best in class governance designers that can become mentors to othersThe ultimate goal as the Commission evolves is to reduce dependency on the Foundation as the sole governance designer of the Collective. The measure for success in this state would be the ability to ship Seasons/Rounds without the Foundation’s involvement. This will require us to gradually increase the responsibilities of Commission members over time (multiple years, likely) as well as to increase the number of members the Commission supports. The inspiration for this program is Core Development Programs. We’re excited to continue iterating towards a Core Delegate Program as metagovernance is one of most important responsibilities in the Collective. In this future, the Foundation will become just one of many Core Delegates proposing metagovernance proposals.What The Foundation Learned During the PilotNote: These are observations and learnings from the Foundation. You can see an overview of the Commission’s own retrospective workshophere.Based on the success of the initial pilot, and engagement of members, we plan to continue the Commission into its next iteration. Below we outline learnings from the pilot, which will inform the next iteration.Expectation Setting:We should have done a kickoff call to level set on the expectations/scope of the Commission in the initial pilot. We thought an asynchronous kick-off would be appreciated by busy Commission members but we later realized this was a missed opportunity to clearly define the goals and success metrics of the pilot.This was also reflected in member survey responses indicating only a moderate level of clarity on Commission goals and responsibilities (seefigma.)Reducing the context gap:We need to do a better job of sharing all context related to specific governance components in order for members to provide high value feedback. We are working to close the gap between the context the Foundation has and the context the Commission, and broader community, has. To this point, we also believe the Commission can play a better role in helping us optimize and execute processes members have first hand experience with, rather than opining on higher level or more abstract concepts.During the Retrospective workshop, members indicated they needed more context to understand how the things they were reviewing fit into the larger system and/or roadmap design.Closing the loop:The Foundation initially didn’t close the loop on how we used and implemented feedback. The Foundation was incorporating feedback but members didn’t have insight into exactly how or when their suggestions were being implemented. Member feedback allowed us to course correct at the mid-way point of the pilot.Timing:The intent was always to ask for feedback earlier enough in the design process that we could alter designs based on member input. However, this requires us to move our internal planning processes forward more than we anticipated. Round 4 and 5 feedback timelines were a bit tight as a result.During the Retrospective workshop, members suggested regularly scheduled feedback cycles and periodic synchronous calls to establish a regular workflow.Trial and error:We learned a little bit about what types of engagement with the Commission are the most effective:Feedback from Commission members on early design drafts was extremely usefulAsking the Commission to author Mission Requests didn’t work well. Citizens’ House Commission members in particular did not feel that writing Missions Requests, which are approved in the Token House, aligned well with their set of responsibilities as expressed by LauNaMu below.image (7)882×242 198 KBDuring the retrospective workshop, Commission members expressed an interest in providing feedback on Mission Request drafts, dividing work into areas of focus, and more two-way dialogue with the Foundation team in the next iteration.Collaboration:More collaboration between members of both Houses was desired. We initially separated the groups to reduce spam in the telegram but later realized this created siloed conversations about things that pertained to both groups and made coordination on joint efforts (such as Retro Funding applications) more difficult.These are observations and learnings from the Foundation. You can see an overview of the Commission’s own retrospective workshophere.Initial Thoughts on the Next IterationThe initial pilot was an MVP test. The next iteration will convert the Commission into a persistent structure, complete with a Charter and Lead.The Foundation will host a kickoff call to level set expectations, goals, and how success will be measured in Season 7.The Commission will be closely consulted on the Foundation’s 2025 planning process as we further transition this to a Collective process.The Foundation will dedicate more resources to manage this program with the proper level of care and attention. A Commission Lead will help better support operations.We will be postponing the launch of the open contribution path component of the Commission until we have further refined the best approach to accomplish longer term goals of the Commission. It is one full workstream to design how the Commission works and another workstream to create a contribution path that supports it. We are still committed to supporting this path, but need to focus our efforts on the refinement and development of the core workstream first. We will open source the Commission’s pilot workspace shortly, which will allow all community members to have full insights into the work that was done and the feedback that was given.The membership criteria will likely change in the next iteration. Current members of the Commission may or may not re-qualify. We are very grateful for pilot member’s contributions, but in an effort to optimize transparent membership criteria, we cannot guarantee that everyone will re-qualify.More about how we envision the Commission evolving over time will follow in a post outlining how the next iteration of the Commission will operate. Launch is expected to be in early November."
Measuring the Concentration of Power in the Collective,"This research analysis was conducted for the Optimism Collective as part of theFoundation Grant.TL;DRThis research report presents theConcentration of Power Index (CPI), an adapted version of the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), developed to assess the concentration of power within the Optimism Collective. By incorporating both individual delegate voting power and the influence of governance bodies - includingHouses, Councils, and Committees (HCC)- the CPI provides a detailed view of governance dynamics. The report highlights key findings on power distribution, the role of delegates, and the CPI’s ability to adjust to changes in governance structures, showing its potential to guide policy changes and support decentralization efforts.AcknowledgementWe sincerely thank the Optimism Collective for sponsoring and supporting this research. Their support allowed us to explore the governance structures within the Collective. We also want to thank@optimistic_emily&@elizaoakfor their support and guidance, which were key to our research’s success. We thank@v3naru_Curiaand the curiaLab team for their valuable data contributions wherever needed. This report could not have been completed without the collaboration of everyone involved, and we deeply appreciate their efforts. Lastly, we thank all survey participants for measuring each HCC’s influence.Team -@ARDev097@Chain_L@Mary17IntroductionThe governance structure of the Optimism Collective plays a key role in supporting decentralized decision-making and ensuring fair representation of stakeholders. However, with ongoing developments within the governance system, evaluating the concentration of power among delegates and governance bodies becomes important. This research report introduces the Concentration of Power Index (CPI), which enhances the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to provide a clearer view of power dynamics. By assessing both individual voting power and the roles of different governance bodies, the CPI aims to check for potential risks related to power concentration while promoting fair governance practices.MethodsThe research began by gathering data on delegates’ voting power from Dune Analytics, offering insights into the influence of individual delegates within the Optimism Collective’s Token House. Information about the various councils and committees, including their members and responsibilities, was sourced from the Optimism Forum.To accurately measure power concentration, theConcentration of Power Index (CPI) was created to factor in both the individual voting power of delegates and their participation across multiple governance bodies, such as Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCC).This dual approach enables a more detailed assessment of power dynamics and their effects on governance within the Optimism ecosystem.Method for Measuring the Influence of Optimism Governance Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCC)The framework for measuring influence is based on several key factors, including Decision-Making Authority, Scope of Influence, Community Engagement, Operational Independence, Voting Power, and Veto Power. Each factor is weighted to reflect its significance in the overall evaluation.The governance structure comprises several Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCCs) such as the Token House, Citizens’ House, and Grants Councils.The weighted score of each HCC is calculated using specific formulas:Token House:image1018×208 16.6 KBLikewise, the weighted scores for other HCCs are calculated using similar formulas:Method for Calculating the CPI:The CPI was determined by combining the influence of Token House delegates with other governance layers, including various Houses, Councils, and Committees. This approach provides a more comprehensive measure of power concentration within the Optimism Collective.CPI Formula:The Concentration of Power Index (CPI) is mathematically defined as follows:image1222×698 65.7 KBThis detailed methodology ensures that the CPI accurately captures the complex relationship between individual voting power and the collective influence of governance bodies, offering a reliable framework for analyzing power concentration within the Optimism Collective.ResultsInfluence of Governance Bodies Within Optimism CollectiveThe table accompanying this report outlines the influence of each governance body, calculated using the weighted parameter scoring method. The Citizens’ House has the highest influence at 34.59%, followed closely by the Token House at 32.33%. The Grants Council (Builders & Growth Experiments Sub-committee) contributes 10.15%, while the Security Council accounts for 13.17%. Other bodies, such as the Grants Council (Milestone & Metrics Sub-committee) at 2.82%, the Code of Conduct Council at 4.32%, and the Developer Advisory Board at 3.01%, have comparatively lower influence, reflecting the distribution of decision-making authority across the different governance bodies.Governance BodyPercentage (%)Token House (Th)32.33%Citizens’ House (Ch)34.59%Grants Council Builders & Growth Experiments Sub-committee (Gc)10.15%Grants Council Milestone & Metrics Sub-committee (Gc(M&M))2.82%Security Council (Sc)13.17%Code of Conduct Council (CoC)4.32%Developer Advisory Board (DAB)3.01%Concentration of Power Index (CPI) Across Different Rounds and SeasonsThe Concentration of Power Index (CPI), measured across different rounds and seasons, is shown in the graph below.The initial CPI for the Token House was 329.25.After including data from Citizen House Round 2 and the councils for Season 3, theCPI significantly dropped to 140.13 and remained stable during Season 4. With the addition of data from Season 5, the CPI further decreased to 91.81, reflecting a clear trend toward decentralization. This trend continued withCitizen House Round 3 at 81.53 and Round 4 at 80.90, highlighting the ongoing decentralization within the governance structure.874×547 24.9 KBHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) Across Different DAOsThe Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) values for Optimism, Compound, Aave, and Uniswap are displayed in the graph below, showing the concentration of voting power among delegates within each DAO. The HHI for Optimism was calculated using only Token House delegates, without considering other governance layers, for easier comparison. The HHI values for Compound, Aave, and Uniswap were determined based on the distribution of voting power among their respective delegates.859×547 24.1 KBConcentration of Power Index (CPI) Across Different DAOsThe graph below displays the CPI values for Optimism, Compound, Aave, and Uniswap, representing the concentration of power in each DAO. Optimism’s CPI of 80.90 shows a decentralized power structure, while Compound’s 320.72 and Aave’s 627.34 indicate more centralized governance. Uniswap’s CPI of 215.29 suggests a balance between decentralization and concentration but is still less decentralized than Optimism. For other DAOs, only their delegate’s voting power is considered for this comparison.859×547 24 KBNakamoto Coefficient Across Different DAOsThe Nakamoto Coefficient, which measures the minimum number of members needed to control over 51% of the voting power, is represented in the bar chart below for Optimism, Compound, Aave, and Uniswap. Optimism requires 21 members to surpass this threshold, indicating relative decentralization. In contrast, Compound requires 13 members and Aave only 8, reflecting a higher concentration of power. Uniswap’s Nakamoto Coefficient is 17, suggesting a decentralized power structure, though slightly more concentrated than Optimism.841×547 19.2 KBConclusionThe Concentration of Power Index (CPI) is a valuable tool for evaluating power distribution within the Optimism Collective. It improves on the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by considering the influence of various governance bodies, such as Houses, Councils, and Committees. The CPI highlights areas where power is concentrated among a small group of delegates, raising concerns about over-centralization, while also identifying areas where power is more evenly spread, supporting decentralization. It provides a clearer understanding of the impact of delegates involved in multiple governance roles, offering a more detailed view of decision-making power. Additionally, the CPI can adapt to changes in governance structures, allowing for real-time assessments of power dynamics. By pinpointing periods of concentrated power and successful moves toward equitable distribution, the CPI helps guide policy changes and governance improvements. Ultimately, the CPI is key to maintaining decentralization and promoting a fair, inclusive governance structure within the Optimism Collective. The temporal chart of CPI can provide the direction in which our Collective is moving in terms of centralization as CPI is modified applying the same benchmark as HHI will not be an accurate measure.image1564×821 80.5 KBSource:-CPI SiteResourcesDetailed Report Link -ReportFrontend Dashboard -Frontend DashboardInfluence Calculator -Influence CalculatorPresentation Link -PresentationObservation File -Observation FileBehind the Scenes Documentation -Behind the ScenesGitHub Repo -Repo Link"
Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amended,"Season 6: Chain Delegation Program AmendedThis is an amended version of the originalChain Delegation Programapproved in Season 5. This will become the authoritative version in the case theSeason 6 proposed Amendmentis approved.OP Chains play an incredibly important role in the Superchain future.Welcoming Baseto the Collective was an exciting first step. The next step in building the Superchain future is ensuring a broad range of OP Chains are represented in the Token House. See here for more information on our approach toOnboarding OP Chains to Optimism Governance.The Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains.The Chain Delegation Program, approved in Season 5, allowed OP to be delegated to OP Chains to enable them to actively participate in Optimism’s governance in Seasons 5 and 6.This program pertains only to L2’s as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.Please note: The Foundation will not facilitate OP Chain membership in the Citizens’ House. Badgeholders represent individual members of the Optimism Collective; they should not represent a project or company in their capacity as badgeholders. Furthermore, in the near future, the criteria required to become a Citizen will be determined by Citizens’ and approved via governance.The Chain Delegation Program temporarily delegates a portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to value-aligned OP Chains based on the criteria outlined below.  Delegations will be made as additional Chains qualify.A total of 20M OP is reserved to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, using idle tokens in the Governance Fund. Delegations will be made as OP Chains qualify, on a rolling basis until, the first 15 qualifying OP Chains have gone through the program.OP Chain Qualification Criteria (Cumulative):OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating > 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive monthsAdditionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).Chains operatingStandard Blockspacewould be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.OP Mainnet will not be eligible for this programDelegation:OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectations:OP Chains must maintain a >70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next SeasonDelegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement onvote.optimism.io. It is also recommended to set an ENS avatar with the logotype of the OP Chain.Chain delegates should identify a point of contact that will be responsible for this delegation. It is recommended that this delegate attend community governance calls, hosted bi-weekly.Chain delegates will be top 100 delegates, which mean they are eligible to provide approvals on proposal drafts and should be active in the governance forums.All delegations made through this program will be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches 3M in delegation (including Partner Fund grants able to be delegated), at the time of opt-in.Accountability:Any OP Chain delegate found to be violating the self-dealing section ofOptimist Expectationswill have their Chain Delegation Program delegations removed for the remainder of the program."
A case for the organizational chart,"Special thanks to@brichis,@Pumbiand the@govNERDsfor the feedback and information support. And to the people at the Developer Advisory Board meeting for motivating to continue.Dear fellow members of the collective,As someone curious about organizational structures, I am surprised not to find any organizational chart that shows how the different operational roles are, both in the OP foundation and with the most active contributors of the collective.For me, having an organizational chart will work like a ‘you are here’ on those park maps. Knowing who is where and who the people are connected to can be very useful; especially in a 100% virtual organization where you can’t get lost in the hallways.I admit that I am a ‘visual’ person and perhaps my opinion is biased…but in order to ‘share’ my vision I decided to create a prototype that exemplifies what I imagine.https://app.mural.co/t/alexsoto6941/m/alexsoto6941/1723490012295/dd52b073d03daf635e611f21d8f3f2f4fe1d0a70?sender=ud6461ce37fd968e224f71144Internal Communication Structure (Draft)Captura de pantalla 2024-08-14 a la(s) 13.03.381920×984 89.3 KBThis figure is inspired by sociocratic/holacratic structures where each ‘circle’ represents a team of some kind. The idea of ​​creating ‘interconnections’ between circles promotes the idea that more information flow between teams has advantages when it comes to adapting to the changing environment. Which are increasingly recurrent.How to read this map *(and some suggestions)*:Each circle belongs to a ‘team’ of some kind (which requires having ‘meetings’ or status reports every so often).Whether sharing a telegram group or a private discord channel, the suggestion is to create a ‘flow of information’ where at least two people from each circle participate.People who are at the intersection of two circles belong to both teams as full members (and sociocracy encourages decisions to be made by consent).The most central circles should avoid making operational decisions to be executed by other circles (but allow them to define how to operate from their autonomy), and rather focus on sharing reports and generating alignment between all parties.Just because two people are not interconnected by circles doesn’t mean they can’t have direct communication. In fact, it’s amazing that we have the ability to send DMs at the speed of light.The more information flow, the more agility.mini-disclosureIn some cases I have put people at random as ‘examples’ of ‘lead’ and ‘representative’ for lack of more information on the matter. I am aware that there are errors and omissions in these lists.Anyone who has information to add can contact me as@alexsotodigitalSome considerations of this approach.Double Link:At each ‘intersection’ there are at least two people, which usually meansa ‘lead’ person (often established by the mother circle)a ‘representative’ chosen by the rest of the circle.Double link is one of the main principles of sociocracy, as it makes sure there is no power-over and ensures flow of information and transparency in all directions. If there was only one person, the group could be in danger of:the person missing an important meeting (preventing a decision from being made or creating a communication gap between both circles).the intermediary person being able to traffic or omit information to avoid some issue.the lead person not having the well-being of the team in their interests and making commitments without it being the opinion of the group.Roles, not people:Although in this first prototype I write the names of the person (as they have chosen their user within the community) and not the role (such as ‘Code of Conduct Council Member 1/5’), I think it is important to highlight that this organizational chart is mapping ‘roles’ and not ‘people’. That’s because:In an organizational chart with people, it is often perceived that the person is immovable and has greater resistance to change; especially in hierarchical organizations where there is ‘a boss’.With roles, a person can be represented in several places in the organizational chart simultaneously (as happens here) which promotes greater mobility and accountability.In a structure by roles,a person can have several roles and a role can be inhabited by multiple people simultaneously.The Ask.I would like to point out that I created this on a Mural canvas in the absence of better technical skills. However, I think this could serve as a blueprint for some team that knows how to bring this to a 2.0 version.If you can think of any team that might be interested in collaborating with me to do this, please tag them in the comments.image1024×576 95.9 KBSome features I imagine:Being able to select the name of the role and when clicking on it, go to see the person or people who occupy it. There could be a link to the forum, as well as other contact information.Having some way of ‘updating’ automatically (at a graphical level) once it is written in an internal database. This way, several people could have editing permissions and it would save time.Set the ‘time period’ for which the participation agreement will be maintained and trigger a notification alarm to let us know it’s time to update or make a change.Being supported on a website that is own by the collective.CommitmentUntil we find a more automatic solution, I am committed to keeping this version as up to date as possible.If there are any changes you would like to request, you can find me as@alexsotodigitalor write to me atalex.soto.digital@gmail.comWhat do you think?Do you think this would be useful?Is it worth building?Yeees!MaybeNah0voters"
Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amendment,"Special thanks to@brichis,@kaereste, and@Porter_Smithfor review and feedback on these amendments as part of theFeedback CommissionSeason 6: Chain Delegation Program AmendmentChain Delegation Program AmendmentThe Chain Delegation Program was not utilized in Season 5 due to longer than expected timelines on the partnership side and due to the ongoing evolution of what it means to be part of the Superchain. However, the Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains. Below we propose an amendment to the original proposal, based on changes that have occurred over the course of Season 5. This program pertains only to L2’s as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:In theSuperchain Registry(or similar)Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating > 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive monthsAdditionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).Chains operating on the Standard Configuration would be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.The size of the program would be increased to 20M, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation. All delegation formulas and caps remain the same.The duration of the program would be extended, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, on a rolling basis until, all qualifying chains have gone through the program.All delegations made through this program will be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches 3M in delegation (including Partner Fund grants able to be delegated), at the time of opt-in.No delegations have been made through this program to date. Any delegations that are made will be noted as a comment to this forum post.OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectationsOP Chains must maintain a >70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next SeasonDelegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement onvote.optimism.io.

You can see the full details in theSeason 6 Reflection Period Guide. If the amendments are not approved, the Chain Delegation Program will continue to through the end of Season 6, as approved in the original proposal.In either case, the Chain Delegation Program will continue to be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund through the end of Season 6."
Exploring Shielded Voting: Enhancing Governance on Optimism,"Hey Optimism Collective!I wanted to start a conversation about a topic that’s been on my mind lately:shielded voting.For those unfamiliar with the concept,shielded votinginvolves encrypting votes during the voting period and decrypting them only after the vote closes. This approach can bring several interesting benefits to our governance processes:Mitigates Bandwagon Effects: By hiding votes until the end, shielded voting prevents people from being influenced by early voting trends. This could encourage more independent and thoughtful decision-making.Reduces Voter Apathy: When voters know their vote counts equally, regardless of when they cast it, they might feel more motivated to participate.Prevents Last-Minute Strategic Voting: With shielded voting, there’s no way to game the system by casting a vote at the last minute to sway the results.While shielded voting sounds promising, I’m curious to hear from you all:Could shielded voting improve our decision-making processes in Optimism?Are there potential downsides or challenges we should consider?Should shielded voting be applied to all proposals or only to specific ones, like elections?How could we implement this in a way that aligns with Optimism’s values and goals?Your thoughts, concerns, and ideas are all welcome. The more perspectives we have, the stronger our governance can become.Looking forward to hearing what you all think!"
Announcing Optimism Fractal’s Intent to Optimize Governance on the Superchain,"GM Optimists! I’m pleased to share an exciting update about Optimism Fractal that can greatly help the Optimism Collective and warmly invite you to join our weekly eventsDuring the 30th Optimism Fractal event, we played an onchain social game where builders rank each other’s work and then discussed the core intents of Optimism Fractal at Optimism Town Hall. After this discussion, aproposalwas approved by the Optimism Fractal Council to update our core intents to include optimizing governance on the Superchain. You can watch the discussion in thisvideoand learn more about the new core intents in thispost.Optimism Fractal is trailblazing the future of governance with a revolutionary decision-making process calledfractal democracyand we’re eager to contribute to Optimism Collective governance with our unique consensus processes, open-source tools, and community events. This focus on governance complements our two other core intents to foster collaboration and award public goods creators on the Superchain. Any feedback is welcome to help us better serve the Collective and actualize the Optimistic Vision.We appreciate your support and are excited to collaborate in pioneering new models of digital democratic governance. We’d love for you to join Optimism Fractal weekly events on Thursdays at 17 UTC, which provide a perfect place to network with governance enthusiasts and learn more about our decision-making processes while playing onchain social games. You’re also welcome to participate at Optimism Town Hall an hour later, where we discuss exciting topics about the Superchain and will discuss Optimism Season 6 this week.I encourage you toRSVPfor the events, explore more atOptimismFractal.com, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. You can find details about this week’s town hall topic inthis postand watch the video where we discussed our core intents below. We hope you enjoy learning about our work and look forward to seeing you at an upcoming event!"
Introducing the Collective Feedback Commission,"Introducing the Collective Feedback CommissionThe Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective’s governance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just one of many “Core Delegates” proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance).As outlined inThe Path to Open Metagovernance,the path to open metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.To date, we’ve been primarily inPhase 0: community informed design.The Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs based on active feedback from governance participants. We receive feedback on late-stage drafts from high-context stakeholders informally, usually after designs are complete.Now we are ready to start enteringPhase 1: Community consulted design process.That means will we continue open-sourcing more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community to build shared context while also consulting community members earlier in the design process.We will do this via two primary mechanisms:Frequent polls on low-context design parameters, open to any community member’s input.Higher context feedback requested of an experimental Collective Feedback Commission. The Commission mostly formalizes what has, to date, been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants such as Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) recipients.Please note all existing avenues for community feedback will remain in place, allowing any member of the community to share their input for incorporation by the Foundation, as always. The goal of Phase 1 is to bring more people into the design process, not keep anybody out. The Feedback Commission is an addition to the existing feedback channels, not a replacement for any of them.Collective Feedback Commission (CFC)The Collective Feedback Commission will consult the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.The Collective Feedback Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high-context delegates, selected based on the qualifying criteria outlined below:10 highly engaged Citizens have been selected based on their contributions, specifically as they relate to governance design, in Retro Funding Rounds 2 & 3:Carl Cervone@ccerv1LauNaMu@LauNaMuSpencer@spengrahLefteris@lefterisjpMatt StephensonJoan@joanbpAmy Jung@amyRev Miller@revmillerSarah Allen@sarahaGriff Green@GriffAll (Season 5) Council/Board/Commission Leads qualify to participate:Alisha.eth@alisha.ethTeresa@teresacdBrichis.eth@brichisGonna.eth@Gonna.ethBrock@brockelmoreThe top 10 disclosed Token House delegates, as per Agora on 3/6/23 (end of Voting Cycle#19) qualify to participate:a16zL2BEATs@kaereste@SinkasLinda Xie@lindaPolynya@polynyaOlimpio@olimpioGFX Labs@GFXlabsLefteris@lefterisjpSNX Ambassadors@MattL@mastermojo@MoneyManDougScott Moore@ceresstationJack Anorak@jackanorakHow it WorksAll CFC members must opt-in to participate.Any open positions as a result of someone choosing not to opt-in will remain unfilled. There is no official resignation policy as resigning members will not be replaced. The Foundation will reach out to qualifying members with additional information.Opt-in forms must be completed by March 31st.We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period of 6 months, beginning April 1st, 2024. That means Token House delegates will consult on the design of Season 6. Citizens will consult on the design of Round 4 and Round 5.It is expected that CFC members will spend an average of 5 hours per Round/Season providing feedback. The CFC will be allocated 750 OP per Token House member and 1,500 OP per Citizens’ House member by the Foundation. The Feedback Commission is also a good candidate for Retro Funding in Round 6: Governance Contributions.Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission members, but may eventually become viewable by the entire community via a read-only public channel.Please note that the Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as an input into designs but is not obligated to incorporate any individual piece of feedback or idea.As outlined inThe Path to Open Metagovernance, there will be multiple phases in the transition to community led metagovernance. The Commission is part of Phase 1, and may evolve into a metaNERD contribution path in later phases, open to anyone who completes the required training or steps required to participate."
Can incentives be a good mechanism to improve Optimism governance?,"GM Optimists!I don’t usually write forum posts, so please bear with me…Its my first day meme752×572 275 KBI’m also not sure if this is the right category. So feel free to correct me…TL;DR: This post is to collect feedback from the community on how incentives can be used to improve Optimism Governance. It has open ended questions and some fun polls to collect aggregated signal for a community-led incentive program that will be run by Unitap.Improving governance accessibility has been one of thecore intents of Optimism. This intent became a Schelling point to align the community and work to improve Governance accessibility. However, human alignment is a complicated nut to crack and the best ways to improve Governance accessibility can be very different for all of us.This post was inspired by@LauNaMu, as I heard her talking not long ago about how Governance incentives can go wrong. My intention is to collect insights, aggregated signal and feedback regarding how to improve governance accessibility overall and specifically what kind of incentives could help this intent and what kind of incentives could turn into perverse incentives that create unintended negative consequences.governance and incentives meme541×715 382 KBIf you were dying to tell the Optimism community how you think we can improve Optimism Governance this is the place to gather all opinions and feedback. Here are some open questions and polls, but feel free to add anything you think is relevant.Open ended questions.What can be improved in Optimism Governance?What kind of interventions would help to improve Optimism Governance? (Solution brainstorming)What prevents OP holders from engaging in governance or delegating their tokens?How can delegators easily monitor their delegates’ participation?Are incentives a good mechanism? If so, how should we market incentive programs to reach its target audience? (for example: OP holders that haven’t delegated or that delegated to inactive or ghost delegates)Are the current KPIs (Delegated supply of OP, Average OP voted per governance proposal) sufficient? Should we consider other metrics like delegate diversity or the concentration of voting power in a handful of delegates?What kind of incentive programs could create negative consequences?

Season 5: Retro Governance Participation Rewards,"Season 5: Retro Governance Participation RewardsThank youA huge thank you is due to delegates and Citizens for their continued dedication to experimentation and iteration. It’s not easy to be the first to try something new, and our governance participants do it everyday.This Season, the Collective continued to experiment with prioritizing strategic work with Missions v2. We took steps toward further decentralization with the establishment of the Security Council and the Anticapture Commission, and experimented with a Developer Advisory Board and a Code of Conduct Council. The Citizens’ House rewarded 30M OP inRetro Funding Round 3and took on the responsibility of veto-ing Protocol Upgrades passed in the Token House. These are significant steps towards social decentralization, which prepare us for greater technological decentralization in future Seasons.Rewards are made retroactively (see whyhere) in accordance with theCollective Rewards Framework. The highest impact contributions will align with the Collective Intents. Thank you for your continued dedication to this experiment to retroactively reward impact. Being a governance participant requires a serious time commitment and the Collective strongly benefits from your engagement.The governance participants that meet the below criteria are eligible to receive a rewards as outlined in the below chart (snapshot as of 5/9/24, the end of the last Voting Cycle of the Season.)CriteriaDefinitionIntentReasoningOPParticipated in Season 5Top 100 delegate with >70% voting participation in Season 5 (abstain votes count towards participation). *Citizens that cast a vote on veto proposals.Progress towards Decentralization (1)Voter turnout is critical to the resilience of the governance system4,000 OP for delegates. *250 OP for Citizens.

GovNFT and Governance Participation Curriculum,"GovNFT Pilot ProgramHi Everyone,The purpose of this post is to seek feedback on a general curriculum for participation in Optimism Governance.Specifically, this curriculum will be used to create incentive-based activities for GovNFT holders as part ofthis grant. The goal is to design a “curriculum” for the best way for new governance participants to engage in meaningful governance activities, which can hopefully be expanded in the future.What are GovNFTs?GovNFTs are a general-purpose governance primitive built by the Velodrome team. As many of you know, tokens for builders’ grants have a 1-year lock. Delegations have been made on these locked tokens in the past but require manual work from the foundation to do so. GovNFTs are an audited smart contract that can keep the tokens “locked” while at the same time allowing the builder to fluidly participate in Optimism Governance.What is this program?To test this primitive before expanding to the broader set of Optimism builder’s grantees, we are creating a pilot program as outlined inthis grant. This pilot program makes available 25K OP to incentivize and reward existing GovNFT holders for valuable participation in Optimism governance. The initial set of users is 200+ users and protocols who have previously earned GovNFTs through previous grants on Velodrome. A series of activities will be assigned a point value. The 25k OP will be distributed among participants in the pilot based on a weighted average of points. The activities and their potential point values are as follows.This is a draft; the goal is to improve the following based on feedback from the community. If you have any ideas for changing or adding activities, please outline them in this thread.Incentivized Activities:DelegationDelegate to an active delegate on-chain (3 points)Post in a program-specific “delegate selection thread” and answer the following questions on why you chose that delegate (12 points)Example questionsWhat delegate did you choose?Why do you think this is a good delegate?In what ways is this delegate aligned with you?What about their delegate profile/statement do you like?What is this delegate’s voting percentage in the last 10 votes?Forum ParticipationMake a thoughtful post in our “bi-weekly governance topic thread” (6 points)This thread will be created every two weeks by the GovNFT champion and cover a current topic in governance.The idea is that it is a governance “sandbox” for this pilot to avoid spam in other threads, however, all governance community members are encouraged to participate.“Spam” responses as judged by the GovNFT Champion will have 6 points deducted.The most thoughtful response in each thread, as judged by the GovNFT Champion, will be awarded an additional 20 points.Community CallsAttend a community call (10 points)Post in a program-specific GovNFT thread after the call (10 points)Becoming a DelegateThis path will only be available to those who already have 7,500 OP or more in their GovNFT.Tasks:Post a delegate statement (25 points)Delegate to yourself (15 points)Introduce yourself in a community call (25 points)Vote in an election cycle (25 points)Guiding PrinciplesIdeally, the activities outlined directly contribute to the governance intents of Season 6 and also Season 5, such as meaningfully driving delegation and distribution of votable supply among a broad set of specific stakeholders, increasing the delegated supply of OP, and increasing the average OP voted per governance proposal.We explicitly want to disincentivize any low-effort behavior that would reduce the quality of discussion on the forums. For that reason, much of the forum participation outlined above is based on participation in program-specific threads.We also want to keep in mind the potential for these activities to become a template for new participants in governance. For example, a new builder in the ecosystem may receive a builder’s grant. They can use the activities outlined above as a guide for the best way to get started in governance.I’m looking forward to your feedback!Michael"
Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amendment,"Special thanks to@brichis,@GFXlabs, and@kaerestefor review and feedback on these amendments as part of theFeedback Commission.Season 6: Anticapture Commission AmendmentSeason 5 introduced an Anticapture Commission, comprised of the highest impact delegates. To date, the Anticapture Commission has played an important role inpushingfor the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes. The Foundation has consulted the Anticapture Commission on several related matters, as has Agora. These conversations have resulted in all changes to the governance contract now going through the Protocol Upgrade governance process. We believe the Anticapture Commission will continue to play an important role in the Collective as wewelcome~10 additional OP Chains to the ecosystem through the end of Season 6.The Anticapture Commission is an experimental and first of its kind governance structure. Through this experiment, the Commission itself is refining its role and discovering the highest impact ways to contribute to the resilience of our governance system.  The below amendments to the Commission Charter are proposed based directly on member feedback.Charter AmendmentThe Anticapture Commission has the below mandate (refined.)The Anticapture Commission exists to prevent capture of the Token House by any one stakeholder or group of stakeholders (protocols, OP Chains, etc.).Please note this commission’s duties are in service to tokenholders. The commission may not explicitly limit tokenholder power and may not limit the rights of tokenholders in favor of any other stakeholder group in any way.Goals (refined for clarity and to reduce scope):Provide alerts to the Citizens’ House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders using the process outlined here. Please note any member of the community may flag a concern to be considered by the anticapture commission via the commission’s email.Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens’ House veto. The Commission is not expected to cast votes on all proposals but exercising the Commission’s delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades, and any other proposals subject to Citizens’ House veto.While not required, the Commission may also chose to:Advocate for the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes, so no one party exercises undue influence over the system.Research, analyze, and advocate for transparency related to the distribution of voting power.MembershipMembership will continue to be comprised of high impact delegates but Council Leads will no longer qualify, separate of meeting membership criteria. Several Council Leads resigned last Season as they didn’t have the ability or context required to contribute meaningfully.Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporationMembers, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegatesANDMaintain = > 70% voting participation over the previous Season (including the following Reflection Period.) This requirement has been simplified to ensure delegates have enough context without overcomplicating criteria.Have received retro voter rewards in any of S1-S5All qualifying members must opt-in to be part of the Commission.Please note: All members need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture Commission.Membership will be determined based on the above criteria at the beginning of each Season. We will eliminate the mid-point recalculation as it adds substantial overhead, creates disruptive onboarding requirements, and did not result in substantial turnover.Anticapture Commission votes are cast based on a simply majority of individual member votes, unless the Commission Internal Operating Procedures stipulate otherwise.Member ResponsibilitiesIn exchange for being entrusted with additional voting power, Anticapture Commission members will be expected to:Members will be expected to vote on 70% of all ACC votes expected to be cast in the Token House. Last season, participation requirements were underspecified. If a Member does not meet this expectation, they will not be eligible to be on the Anticapture Commission the following Season. This is in line with the voting participation requirements of top delegates and all delegation programs in the Collective.The requirements to attend/host office hours and provide delegate approvals will be removed, based on member feedback.It is recommended, but not required, that members attend internal meetings and/or community office hours, as appropriate. Members that cannot attend should provide async feedback on drafts or meeting notes.All other requirements for members and the Lead will remain the same, with the exception of the elimination of the Lead’s former responsibilities around calculating mid-point membership. Seehere.The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization.It is recommended, but not required, for members to make best efforts to provide feedback on and/or contribute to authorship of any reports circulated to the Citizens’ House.The new charter, updated with the above changes, can be viewed in its entiretyhere.Qualifying Delegates (to be updated below at conclusion of Special Voting Cycle#23a)If you would like to be a part of the ACC for Season 6 –thisformmustbe filled out beforeJune 14 23:00 UTC@kaereste@linda@polynya@lefterisjp@olimpio@GFXlabs@jackanorak@Michael@she256@brichis@Joxes@katie@PGov@404DAO@blockchainatusc@Tane@Griff@Pr0@MoneyManDoug@MattL@MinimalGravitas@Gonna.eth@ethernaut@Luckyhooman.ethstevegachau.eth@Oxytocin@OPUser0x5f4bcccb5c2cbb01c619f5cfed555466e31679b6@web3magnetic@StableLab@Gauntlet@v3naru_CuriaWhat Does it Mean for Delegates?The proposed amendments to the Anticapture Commission will go to a vote in Special Voting Cycle#23a.

How do you feel about a Conflict Committee,"As of now, OPerating manual does not have any guideline on handling conflict of interest and I want to hear your opinion on this.Challenge:-Lets say a project feels that an entity is voting against their proposal or giving someone a favor for some reason.They can raise their voice but once voting is done, no one can do anything and foundation will act on the final result.What if some one feels that I am acting and voting unethically.Again, we dont have any thing in OPerating manual on how to handle this.What to do if I see biasI would appreciate if we can discuss this on this forum but what if other party is not willing to listen.Suggestion:-Create a committee to handle such scenario, we can reach out to this committee with these type request and their decision would be final.Who Would be on this committee:-Person/Team raising the request will choose 2 person*Other party involved, if chooses to, can also choose 2 personOne delegate(for simplicity we will keep any delegate with 0.5% voting power) and one OP CitizenHow I see it in work:-3 out of 4 vote is needed to reach final decision.Keeping it small will help the committee would be trivial at initial stepsIt is MANDATORY to have OP Citizen in this committee.Challenge:-Generally, I am not a big fan of creating many committee as I believe this makes things complicated and increase bureaucracy. But as we are doing and learning things iteratively, I am in favor of this. We should try and see how things works out, if not needed, we can decommission this committee.Happy to hear your thoughts on this.Edit:-1Adding some context with an example.I submitted a proposal and was voted by Token House but I am not happy with how X entity has voted on my proposal. So, here i will invoke the Conflict committee and submit my case.Token house is and will be deciding pillar, what will change, if the Conflict committee approve my request,onlyvote of X will be removed from the final result. Votes and result from rest of the Token will still apply. We are not over-riding Token house, we are just removing conflict."
Code of Conduct Councils,"Update on 06/03/2024:There have been 2 rescopings of the Code of Conduct Council since this original experiment:Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage EnforcementRescoping #2The Code of Conduct Council, if renewed in Season 6, will enforce theRules of Engagement, which applies to all users of Optimism platforms.Token House Code of Conduct Council CharterACode of Conductwent into affect in December 2021. The Code of Conduct is critical to maintaining a healthy governance community that all delegates feel welcome engaging in, thereby increasing the accessibility of Optimism governance.The Foundation currently plays an administrative role in processing Code of Conduct violation reports and the Token House votes on enforcement of valid violation reports. The community hasexpressed interestin a more rigorous enforcement process while other delegates have expressed that they are uncomfortable voting directly on Code of Conduct Violation proposals.The Foundation accepted two submissions toRFP #2aimed at the prevention of Code of Conduct violations in the first place:GravityDAOs conflict resolution trainingsrnDAOs community health analytics dashboardSeason 5 will further decentralize the Foundation’s role in processing violations of the Code of Conduct and remove enforcement responsibility from Token House delegates. Accordingly, the Foundation will authorize a Token House Code of Conduct Council, according to theCouncil Framework.GoalsReplace the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct ViolationsEliminate enforcement responsibilities for Token House delegates by entrusting the Code of Conduct Council to process disputes. To create accountability for the Code of Conduct Council, the Token House may veto enforcement actions at any timePlease note that due to the experimental nature of the Code of Conduct Council and the high security requirements of theSecurity Council, any Code of Conduct Violation reports related to members of the Security Council will still be subject to a full Token House vote, following the process under Code of Conduct Violation proposals (the operating manual will be updated shortly to reflect Season 5 updates.)Council StructureThe Council will be comprised of five members and a Council Lead. Decisions will be made based on a simple majority of members, using a 1 member = 1 vote model to determine both the level of violation (temporary suspension or severe violation) and whether or not a violation occurred.MembershipThe Council Lead will be appointed by the Foundation in the first Season and subsequently elected.

Developer Advisory Board,"Introducing the Developer Advisory BoardDevelopers are among the Collective’s most important stakeholders as they are building the Optimism protocol and the applications on top of it. Governance of an L2, and growth of its supporting ecosystem, will require governance to make many technical decisions.For example:Intent #1, progress towards technical decentralization, is the highest priority for the Collective. Proposals under this Intent require technical expertise.Builder grants aim to increase the number of active developers deploying on Optimism. The Grants Council must make decisions that are heavily informed by the developer perspective, particularly at the application level.The Token House is tasked with evaluating high importance protocol upgrades and enforcing theLaw of Chains, both of which require high levels of technical understanding. In future Seasons, the Developer Advisory Board’s mandate may be expanded to assist delegates in assessing technical proposals.Given the need for Optimism governance to make good technical decisions, the Foundation is proposing the establishment of a Developer Advisory Board (DAB) with the below mandate.Developer Advisory Board CharterGoalsAssess and approveDelegate Mission Requestdrafts based on their technical meritsAid the Grants Council in assessing approvedDelegate Mission Requests and Mission ApplicationsunderIntent #1Advise the Grants Council in assessing the completion of technical milestonesAdvisory Board StructureThis Advisory Board is not a Council as they will serve in an advisory capacity without official decision making authority. Therefore, they will not be elected as representatives, but will rather be appointed. The initial set of members will be appointed by the Foundation. In subsequent Seasons, members will be appointed by the Grants Council.The Developer Advisory Board will not vote on proposals. However, the advisory board’s approval will be required on all Delegate Mission Requests under Intent#1. In order to provide approvals, a simple majority of advisory board members must agree that an approval has technical merit. Evaluation criteria and rubrics should be made public, when applicable. The Grants Council should also consider the Developer Advisory Board’s input on all Mission Applications under Intent#1.MembershipThe initial Developer Advisory Board will be comprised of six members and a lead, one of which will be a non-voting member of the OP Labs engineering or product team. One member of the Developer Advisory Board will be designated as the Lead to manage general coordination and operations. The Lead will be a non-voting member.  If approved, the Foundation will appoint the below members:Board Lead:BrockBoard Member:PhilogyBoard Member (forfeiting compensation):NoahBoard Member:ZachBoard Member:RomanBoard Member:JepsenOP Labs Representative (non-voting):KelvinSummary of experience and qualificationshereAll members may be removed from their positions via the Representative Removal proposal type in theOperating Manual. If a member of the Developer Advisory Board is unable to fulfil the responsibilities listed below, they may publicly step down and the Foundation (Grants Council, in future Seasons) should appoint a replacement by no later than the end of the next Voting Cycle.Future AppointmentsThe Developer Advisory Board will need to be re-appointed by the Grants Council each Season as the members of the Grants Council must be re-elected and are subject to change. As the expertise represented on the Grants Council changes, the composition of the advisory board may also need to change.Future appointees of the board should be selected considering the below qualities:Must have:history of development in the Optimism and/or Ethereum ecosystemdeep understanding of developments in the Optimism ecosystemability to dedicate sufficient time fulfilling member responsibilitiesNice to have:experience with security and or auditingexperience evaluating technical grants (examples include, but are not limited to, evaluating grants for the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, and/or other protocol grant programs)Member ResponsibilitiesReview all Delegate Mission Request drafts under Intent#1and provide feedback/reasoning if the Developer Advisory Board’s approval is NOT provided on any proposal drafts before deadlines. The Developer Advisory Board is encouraged to create a public rubric, using a rubric process similar to that of the Grants Council.Provide a statement on each approved Delegate Mission Request either affirming why it’s important or registering skepticism as to its technical merits.Work with the Grants Council to assess the merits of Mission Applications under Intent#1. The Developer Advisory Board may also assess the technical merits of Mission Applications under other Intents, but it is not required.Assess the completion of technical milestones related to Intent#1Missions and/or Mission Requests for other Intents that the Developer Advisory Board has advised the Council on.Members may also create their own Delegate Mission Requests, but are not required to do so.Members should expect to dedicate 5-8 hours per week, on average, to these responsibilities.The Advisory Board Lead should:publish the board’sinternal operating proceduresbefore the beginning of Season 5facilitate coordination of board member review and host regular board meetings, which should occur at least once per Grants Cycle (every 6 weeks.) It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the communityrun a process to ensure milestones on technical Missions have been met before milestone-based dispersements are madeexercise decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus on an administrative or operational matterAdvisory Board BudgetWe propose an initial budget of 12,500 OP per Advisory Board Member (excluding the OP Labs representative) and 20,000 OP for the Advisory Board Lead, for a total budget of 70,000 OP to be dispersed at the end of Season 5. The initial budget will be important to attract top talent, but we believe the contributions of the Developer Advisory Board are highly conducive to RetroPGF funding and recommend the board be primarily rewarded retroactively.Consistent with other reward allocations, all Developer Advisory Board rewards will be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.What does it Mean for Delegates?Delegates will need to approve the Developer Advisory Board budget and ratify its membership in Special Voting Cycle#16a. If approved, the Developer Advisory Board will have ample time to establish its internal operating procedures before the start of Season 5."
Season 6: Missions v2.5,"Special thanks to@brichis,@GFXlabs,@Gonna.eth,@jackanorak,@kaereste,@Matt/@mastermojo, and@Porter_Smith, for review and feedback of scope changes as part of theFeedback Commission.Missions v2.5The Mission process has been an ongoing experiment, which we refine each Season based on delegate and grant applicant feedback. Much of the Mission process will remain the same in Season 6, to preserve continuity, with some changes aimed at simplifying the process for delegates and improving the grant applicant experience.  All changes and simplifications are proposed based on direct feedback from grant applicants, delegates, and Council members. As always, we will continue to experiment and iterate based on learnings in Season 6. You can reference the full retrospectivehere.For simplicity, the new process will be outlined in two separate guides.-Mission Requests: Delegate Voting Guide-Missions: Grant Application GuideMissionsimage1120×1548 61.5 KBA summary of changes relative to Season 5 is outlined below:TheFeedback Commissionwill be able to propose Mission Requests underIntent #1, as they pertain to governance initiatives. This is an important step in thePath towards Open Metagovernance.The Grants Council will be able to propose Mission Requests underIntent #3A.The Growth Team of the Foundation will create one Mission Request underIntent #3B. This allows the Foundation to temporarily facilitate coordination across Superchain initiatives, one of the Foundation’s most important roles.  In the future, it’s possible that Mission Requests under this Intent may be proposed by OP Chain delegates.Why these changes?Top 100 delegates will no longer be asked to createorapprove Mission Request drafts. This dramatically reduces the complexity of the process, the amount of downtime in the grants program, and the potential for builder confusion. For a comprehensive overview of the intensity of the previous Mission Request approval process, please see  SEED LatAm’sreport.Any member of the Feedback Commission and/or Grants Council may still choose to sponsor a Mission Request authored by any member of the community. 13 Mission Requests in Season 5 were sponsored, indicating sponsorship can play an important role in this process.In reality, the majority of Mission Requests were proposed by members of the Grants Council in Season 5, so this doesn’t change a lot in practice.The Grants Council must assess Mission Applications and separating the creation and evaluation of Mission Requests, creates a version of the principal-agent problem. The missions v2.5 reduces this dynamic while still balancing power among multiple stakeholders (seeDAO Design Principles.)All Mission Request drafts will still be voted on by the Token House, meaning all delegates still have the final say over which Mission Requests are supported under each Intent. Mission Requests will be proposed in a rank order, but delegates may override the suggested order by casting votes in any order they choose. This allows delegates to maintain agency while reducing the cognitive overhead and time required.The Grants Council will continue to process all grant applications under each Request in regular 3-6 week cycles throughout the Season.This process will allow Mission Requests to be rank ordered during the first cycle of the Season (Voting Cycle#24), reducing downtime in the grants program, an important consideration for growth. Please reference theDelegate Mission Voting Guidefor details on rank ordering and budgeting.Improvements will be made to the application process to better optimize the experience for builders and address key pain points that emerged during S5.The Foundation will work closely with the Grants Council to align grants calendars with the governance calendar, ensuring simplicity and understandability of key deadlines and dates.The Foundation conducted research on the applicant experience and shared recommendations for designing processes optimized for applicants with the Grants Council.The Developer Advisory will advise the Grants Council on all technical grants and milestones, regardless of the Intent they fall under.The Foundation will advise the Grants Council on all governance Mission Requests, to ensure they correspond to governance roadmaps.The full Season 5 retrospective can be foundhere.These changes were directly informed by feedback from delegates, grant applicants, the Grants Council, and the Developer Advisory Board. As always, Missions v2.5 will be treated as an experiment and we’ll collected feedback throughout the process  to make adjustments as needed based on learnings."

In Season 6, we’ll pause to reflect and refine these programs, optimizing them to support strategic goals for the Superchain. Throughout Season 6, we also aim to provide more transparency into key milestones for transferring more control over the governance system to the community via various public roadmaps.These proposals are based on 100’s of pieces of feedback documented by the Foundation throughout the Season, reports and analysis conducted by the community, periodic feedback surveys, public feedback threads, theCollective Feedback Commission,retrospectivesconducted by community representatives, etc.IntentsIntents are high level strategic goals the entire Collective works towards. Each Intent has a target metric indicating what success looks like for each Intent.Season 5:Intents applied to the entire Collective but specified that the Governance Fund was only meant to support OP Mainnet. The Foundation set 3 out of 4 Intents, and the community set Intent#3:Improve the Consumer Experience.Season 6:The Foundation will propose all Intents, which will now be ratified by governance. Intents will apply to the entire Collective.

In Season 5, it only encompassed technical decentralization.Developer Advisory Board Renewal (DAB):The Developer Advisory Board was created to help the Collective evaluate technical decisions.Season 5:The DAB reviewed all technical Missions under Intent#1(Progress Towards Technical Decentralization) and helped the Grants Council assess any technical milestones.Season 6:If renewed, the DAB will help the Grants Council assess all technical grants and milestones. They will also provide plain english explanations of all protocol upgrades and be required to provide 1/4 delegate approvals on Protocol Upgrade drafts.Anticapture Commission Amendments (ACC):The anticapture commission was created to empower a group of high context delegates with 10M OP in delegation with the mandate to inform the Citizens’ House of any capture in the Token House.Season 5:The anticapture commission was delegated 10M OP in delegation to counter the voting power of other large stakeholder groups (investors, OP Chains, etc.) and mandated to prevent capture in the Token House.Season 6:The ACC was initially authorized through the end of Season 6. To date, the ACC’s primary impact has been in pushing the Foundation (a key stakeholder in the Collective) to provide more transparency into technical governance parameters and to reduce our control over those parameters. Governor Upgrades require governance approval as a result of these efforts. Amendments are proposed to make minor changes based on learnings in Season 5.Code of Conduct Rescoping:The Code of Conduct has been rescoped multiple times since the end of Season 4, based on continuous learnings. Please referenceCoC Rescoping #2to understand the option torenew the Code of Conduct Councilfor an additional Season.NEW in Season 6: Continuous Transition of Governance Power to the Community:Stage 1 Decentralization:A variety of protocol upgrades will help Optimism reach Stage 1 decentralization.

Delegates may also be asked to approve multiple Protocol Upgrades that bring us closer to on-chain execution throughout Season 6.Security Council Election:The Security Council enacts Protocol Upgrades and is comprised of a group of trusted community members. The first Security Council election for Cohort A will occur in August!Intent 2:Bring Chains to the SuperchainChain Delegation Program Amendments (CDP):The Chain Delegation Programs enables OP Chains to become active participants in Optimism Governance.Season 5:The Chain Delegation Program approved 10M OP to be used to grant temporary delegation of 1M OP to any OP Chain joining the Superchain.Season 6:The program was initially approved to run through Season 6. The program wasn’t utilized in Season 5, due to a variety of factors. Amendments are proposed to rescope and extend the program to support our strategy of onboarding new OP Chains to governance (more detailshere)Intent 3:Grow Application Developers on the SuperchainMissions grants are made out of the Governance Fund and support the Collective’s strategic Intents. Select delegates can make a Mission Request outlining the specific types of grants they’d like the Governance Fund to make.Mission Requests v2.5:Season 5:We iterated on the Mission Request process in Season 5. You can read the full retrospectivehere.Season 6:Members of the Grants Council and Collective Feedback Commission will be able to create Mission Requests, subject to Token House approval. The application process will be simplified and refined based on grant applicant user research and closer collaboration with the Grants Council.

The primary use case will be in the Token House’s evaluation of prospective budgets, but these guidelines can also help ensure more consistency and predictability for voter rewards (delivered retroactively at the end of each Season, based on governance participation.)Trust TiersWe will improve the Trust Tiers, based on user research, and transition them from a conceptual minimal viable product to an attestation based mechanism for building reputation within the Collective. More information will be provided before the start of Season 6.Open Design ProcessWe’ve embarked on Phase 1 on thePath to Open Metagovernance, launching theCollective Feedback Commission, which informed early drafts of Season 6 designs.The govNERDsgovNERDs facilitate community understanding and participation in more governance processes. In Season 6, we will transition this program from a Foundation Mission Request to anopen contribution path, enabling more community members to get involved (more details at the start of Season 6!)Steady StateGovernance CalendarAs our governance system matures and we grow the number of external contributors interacting with it, we need more predictability in our governance calendar. Seasons are now standardized into 6 month periods broken up by 6 week Reflection Periods. There will be no downtime for Protocol Upgrades and we strive to limit the downtime for the grants program to 9 weeks, twice per year.See theSeason 6 Reflection Period Guidefor detailed outline of what you’ll need to do during the Reflection Period!Citizens will be asked to opt-in to participate in governance in Season 6, more details soon!We understand delegates have other commitments and may need to step away. Please see theDelegate Resignation Process."
Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended,"Season 6: Anticapture Commission AmendedThis is an amended version of the originalAnticapture Commission Charterapproved in Season 5. This will become the authoritative Charter in the case theSeason 6 proposed Amendmentis approved.Season 5 introduced an Anticapture Commission, comprised of high impact delegates. The Anticapture Commission has the below mandate (refined.)The Anticapture Commission exists to prevent capture of the Token House by any one stakeholder or group of stakeholders (protocols, OP Chains, etc.).Please note this commission’s duties are in service to tokenholders. The commission may not explicitly limit tokenholder power and may not limit the rights of tokenholders in favor of any other stakeholder group in any way.We have run or proposed similar delegation programs in the past. The Protocol Delegation Program and recently proposed Chain Delegation Program are similarly temporary delegation programs aimed at increasing the representation of important tokenholder groups. The Anticapture Commission is delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund through Season 6. At the end of Season 6, the Anticapture Commission would need to propose any continuation of the program to Governance, but the intention is for this program to expire.Anticapture Commission CharterGoalsProvide alerts to the Citizens’ House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders using the process outlinedhere. Please note any member of the community may flag a concern to be considered by the anticapture commission via the commission’s email.Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens’ House veto. The Commission is not expected to cast votes on all proposals but exercising the Commission’s delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades, and any other proposals subject to Citizens’ House veto.While not required, the Commission may also chose to:Advocate for the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes, so no one party exercises undue influence over the system.Research, analyze, and advocate for transparency related to the distribution of voting power.Commission StructureThe Anticapture Commission would be comprised of high impact delegates (delegates meeting the membership criteria outlined below). Anticapture Commission votes would be cast based on a simply majority of individual member votes, unless the Commission Internal Operating Procedures stipulate otherwise.MembershipMembership will be determined based on the below criteria at the beginning of each Season.Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporationMembers, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegatesANDMaintain = > 70% voting participation over the previous Season (including the following Reflection Period.) This requirement has been simplified to ensure delegates have enough context without overcomplicating criteria.Have received retro rewards for governance participation in any Season.All qualifying members must opt-in to be part of the Commission. Any qualifying member may choose not to opt-in for any reason. If less than 50% of qualifying members choose not to opt-in before the start of Season 5, the Commission may be reconsidered.Please note: All members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture CommissionMember ResponsibilitiesIn exchange for being entrusted with additional voting power, Anticapture Commission members will be expected to:Members will be expected to vote on 70% of all ACC votes expected to be cast in the Token House. Last season, participation requirements were underspecified. If a Member does not meet this expectation, they will not be eligible to be on the Anticapture Commission the following Season. This is in line with the voting participation requirements of top delegates and all delegation programs in the Collective.It is recommended, but not required, that members attend internal meetings and/or community office hours, as appropriate. Members that cannot attend should provide async feedback on drafts or meeting notes.It is recommended, but not required, for members to make best efforts to provide feedback on and/or contribute to authorship of any reports circulated to the Citizens’ House.Members may designate other leadership roles amongst themselves as necessary/desiredMembers will receive group delegation, but not OP rewards, for their participation on the Anticapture Commission. However, meeting the criteria required to be part of the Anticapture Commission may be included in the qualification criteria forretro delegate rewardsMembers must elect a Commission Lead each Season, by simple majority vote among qualifying membersThe Anticapture Commission Lead should:Qualify to be a member of the Anticapture CommissionOrganize regular commission meetings. It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the community. The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization.Coordinate the execution of votes from the delegation wallet (possibly via a commission snapshot space)Author, or coordinate authorship, of any reports circulated to the Citizens’ House, according to the process outlinedhere. A report must have 4 delegate approvals from commission members to be considered valid.Exercise decision-making authority in the event that the commission cannot come to consensus on a matter (ie. serve as tie breaker)"
The Path to Open Metagovernance,"The Path Towards Open Metagovernance DesignThe Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective’s governance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, facilitated by the Foundation based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point the system’s design must be adaptive, with the Foundation just one of many contributors proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance.)We’ve heard your feedback regarding more transparency and involvement in the path towards open metagovernance design. This post outlines our current approach to governance design as well as an experimental path to community led metagovernance design.Overview of Governance Design (Illustrative)Untitled2265×1348 115 KBHypothesis: Based on learnings, community feedback, and/or internal milestones (4), a hypothesis is developed for how a change in governance design could help us further achieve our governance system design goals (to be open sourced at a later date.)A hypothesis is informed by a number of factors, including governance goals & design requirements that have been identified following our governance design process (to be open sourced at a later date.)Experiment: The hypothesis is tested via a time-bound, and ideally isolated, experiment  (if/when possible).Measure & Analyse: The performance of the experiment is analysed and measured. Right now, much of this occurs qualitatively (via surveys, informal feedback, retrospectives, etc.) but we strive to incorporate more quantitative measures as the system evolves.Learnings & Iteration:Based on the synthesis of qualitative feedback from governance participants and analysis (3), the hypothesis is proven/disproven. Learnings are then documented and shared, informing new hypotheses.Community involvement in Governance DesignUntitled (2)2265×1901 203 KBHypothesis: Hypotheses are developed using several inputs that feed into our governance design process, which is informed by our design principles and the full context of the design goals of the governance system.Inputs include:Learnings from previous cycles (4)Community ideasThe Foundation’s governance milestones and goalsThe Foundation uses these inputs to develop a hypothesis and proposes an experiment to test it; these hypotheses may come directly from community members.The proposed hypothesis and experiment are published to the forum and governance participants provide feedback.Examples:Guide to Season 5,Retro Funding 3 Round Design,Moving to a Grants CouncilExperiment: (If possible) The hypothesis is tested via a time bound, and ideally isolated, experiment.The Foundation will propose an experiment to be run for the length of a round or Season. Sometimes a longer trial period is proposed. Subsequent extensions are subject to governance renewal, following retrospectivesExample:Protocol Delegation Program RenewalExperiments are tested on the smallest scale practical to startExample: The concept of aCode of Conduct Councilis being tested only in the Token House, before any possible extension to the Citizens’ HouseMeasure & Analyse: The performance of the experiment is measured and analysed.There are several sources of feedback that inform (3)Community-led Quantitive Analyses: The community leverages quantitive data to analyse the performance of the experimentExample:Retro Funding Voting SimulationsCommunity Sourced Qualitative Feedback: The Foundation conducts feedback surveys to evaluate all programs; Councils, Boards, and Commissions must conduct retrospectives at the end of their terms; informal feedback is documented by the Foundation and collected on an ongoing basis viafeedback threadsExample: During Retro Funding 3, the Foundation documented 300+ pieces of feedbackFoundation Measurements against Desired Outcomes: The Foundation aims to share these ahead of experiments this year as we’ve hired a Research and Experiments Lead to bring more rigour to this part of the processLearnings & Iteration: Based on the synthesis of step (3), the hypothesis is proven/disproven.Learnings are documented and sharedExample:Retrospective on Retro Funding 3,Retrospective on Missions v1The Foundation develops new hypotheses based on these learnings, utilising our governance design process, informed by theDAO Design Principlesand our governance design goalsThe Path to Open MetagovernanceThe Foundation’s approach is to develop the governance system gradually, learning and adapting over time. The path to open metagovernance will, similarly, occur gradually over multiple phases. The phases outlined below are likely to change in accordance with our design process. Even so, open sourcing this outline is itself an important step towards Phase 1 (below).Phase 0 (Current state):Community informed design processThe Optimism Foundation proposes designs based on active input from governance participants, as outlined in the graphic above.Examples:  Token House Seasons are designed and iterated on based on delegate feedback. Retroactive Public Goods Funding rounds are designed and iterated on based on Citizen feedbackFeedback from high context stakeholders occurs informally, usually after designs are complete. Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and/or RetroPGF recipients may be consulted on late stage drafts.Phase 1:Community consulted design process(Launching soon!)As we open source more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community we begin to build the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1.ethDenver 2024 presentationThe Collective DAO ArchivesIn Phase 1, community feedback will be incorporatedduringdesign process, not just after.Frequent polls on low context design parameters will be open to any community member’s input.Higher context feedback will be requested from a Collective Feedback Commission (CFC.) The Commission mostly formalizes what has to date been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants.About the Commission:The Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high context delegates, selected based on qualifying criteria and opt-in requirements, to be published at a later date. The Foundation will request input from the Commission on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other commission members, but may eventually be viewable by the entire community via a read-only public channel. We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period, evaluating its efficacy like any other experiment, using the process outlined above. More details will be posted to the forum shortly.Phase 2:Community directed design processIf continued, the Feedback Commission may evolve into a metaNERD contribution path, that would train and enable metaNERDs to design discrete components of the governance system. Imagine a bounty board of governance design components that can be completed by MetaNERDS.Phase 3:Collaborative design processFinally, if successful, the metaNERD contribution path may evolve into a Core Delegate program.Core Delegates are our vision for the group of high context governance participants that maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core Optimism governance system, similar to Core Devs, which maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core protocol.Meta MetaToday is an exciting day for the Collective as we take the first steps towards a more open, and ultimately more collaborative, metagovernance design process.As more of the Foundation’s governance design thinking is shared with the community, the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1 is built. To that end, today we’ve open sourced several of our DAO design resources as additions to the Collective DAO Archives.The Collective DAO ArchivesDAO Design PrinciplesDAO Function GuidelinesGovernance System Design Goals (to be open sourced at a later date!)DAO Design Process (to be open sourced at ethCC!)As always, your feedback on all of the above is welcome below."
Season 5: Missions v2 Retrospective,"Season 5: Mission Requests v2 RetrospectiveBased on feedback from delegates, grant applicants, the Grants Council, and the Developer Advisory Board, below you will find a Season 5 Mission Request retrospective. You may also reference the extensive report on the process created by Seed LatAmhere, which helped to inform the retrospective below.This retrospective has been used to inform the design ofMissions v2.5. The primary learning from Season 5 Missions was the need to optimize the experience for builders. Many of the changes in v2.5 are aimed at optimizing the entire experience for builders, a key priority supportingIntent #3: Grow Application Devs on the Superchain.Many of the stages below are no longer relevant in v2.5 but the retrospective may serve as reference to help the community better understand how we arrived at the v2.5 design. You can skip straight to the Season 6 processhere.This retrospective is not exhaustive but summarizes many of the main pieces of feedback and analysis.Drafting Mission RequestsThere were 74 Mission Request drafts in Season 5, relative to 49 Mission Proposal drafts in Season 4.Being the first time delegates were asked to draft Mission Requests, there was confusion over whether a Mission Request should specify the team to complete it, the ideal level of specificity, and what was meant by the term “baseline grant amount.” Delegates asked for clarification on whether a Mission Request could be submitted under multiple Intents, whether they could vote on their own Mission Requests, and whether Mission Requests could later receive Retro Funding, if eligible. Builders were confused about whether they were expected to create Mission Requests or apply to them. The drafting process required considerable time and effort from the top 100 delegates.Missions v2.5simplifies the drafting process by reducing the set of eligible delegates to members of the Grants Council and theCollective Feedback Commission. In practice, there is very little change as the set of eligible delegates proposed the majority of Mission Requests in Season 5.We believe this change will:Improve the scoping of Mission Requests and prevent projects from writing Mission Requests tailored to their own products.Simplify the process for all delegates, while still allowing any community member’s idea to be sponsored by eligible delegates.Abstract the drafting and approval process away from builders, which should streamline their experience. Builders shouldn’t have to interact with the Mission Request drafting process, they only need to understand the grant application process.Eliminate the need for delegate approvals, which when combined with the other changes, reduces the amount of downtime in our grants program by 3 weeks, which is important to applicants.We have clarified ambiguities in this process in the following guide:Mission Request Creation GuideSponsoring Mission Requests (New in Season 5)In Season 5, any top 100 delegate could draft a Mission Request. However, if you weren’t a top 100 delegate, you could ask one to sponsor your idea. Roughly half of Mission Requests that were allocated tokens were sponsored, indicating sponsorship serves a meaningful function.Sponsorship will continue in Season 6! In Season 6, only delegates that are part of the Grants Council or the Collective Feedback Commission will be able to draft Mission Requests. Given the value of sponsorship in Season 5, it is recommended that those delegates sponsor ideas suggested by other community members.The number of delegates sponsoring community ideas is likely to remain consistent with Season 5, as only 24/100 delegates sponsored in Season 5. In Season 6, there will be ~ 40 eligible delegates able to sponsor.Notably, a majority of Mission Requests under Intent#1and Intent#3were made by external contributors that were sponsored, indicating delegates and/or the Governance Fund may not be the highest context party to support work under these Intents. In Season 6, Mission Requests will be rescoped to the Intents focused on governance contributions and ecosystem growth, and other mechanisms will be utilized to support core technical contributions, infrastructure, and developer tooling (seeSeason 6 Intents.)Approving Mission Request DraftsThe approval process is one method to provide a quality filter on proposals. It appears to be effective, as only 58% of Season 5 drafts proceeded to a vote, relative to 63% in Season 4.A majority of delegate time and effort was spent providing approvals on drafts. While the below initiatives to make the approval process easier appear to have been effective, we don’t believe this complex process is the highest impact use of delegate attention.Increasing the set of delegates that could provide approvals to top 100 delegates allowed more delegates to provide approvals. Notably, 30% of the delegates that provided approvals in Season 5 would not have been eligible to provide approvals in Season 4. However, the percentage of eligible delegates that participated remained flat season over season.The Foundation randomly sampled proposals to delegates that volunteered to provide approvals, which had a moderate participation rate but received positive feedback from participants.The govNERDs were extremely helpful in promoting compliance with scope and templates and ensuring proposers received feedback and approvals.We extended the time period to provide approvals relative to Season 4 and the Grants Council was not occupied with other duties during this period, as in Season 4.While approvals serve as an important quality filter for major proposals (like Protocol Upgrades), other means of quality filtering are necessary when there are many proposals to evaluate in the same cycle, as with Mission Requests. Constraining the set of delegates eligible to create proposals is another filtering mechanism, which is what most DAOs use (ie. minimum proposal thresholds.) We will experiment with this filtering method in Season 6.The delegate approval process will be eliminated for Mission Requests in Season 6, reducing the workload on delegates and reducing downtime and confusion for grant applicants.Voting on Mission Requests63% of the Mission Requests that moved to a vote were approved (36% approval rate from original drafts). This compares to 87% in Season 4 (55% approval rate from original drafts).Season 5 was the first Season in which rank ordering was relevant, under Intent#2and Intent#3only, as 10 proposals (~25%) received enough votes to meet quorum but weren’t allocated tokens as they would have been over the Intent allocation.Meanwhile, 25% of the Intent#1allocation went unallocated while 60% of the Intent#4allocation went unallocated. Underallocation can be indicative of many things including lack of ideas, over budgeting, and/or a mismatch between the Governance Fund and the type of work to be supported. In the case of Intent#1, we believe the Governance Fund is not the best option to support this type of work given the stage of development of the OP Stack. A smaller allocation for Intent#4(now under Intent#1) seems appropriate based on demand over the past two Seasons.We received questions on the approval ranking voting mechanism and evaluated how provision of tokens would have changed using a mechanism that optimizes for maximum allocation rather than allocating tokens to only the highest priority initiatives. In short, there was a small portion of tokens unallocated due to the ranking mechanism. There was a larger portion of tokens unallocated due to lack of demand under Intent#1and Intent#4. There was ~2M OP requested that wasn’t provided due to prioritization (in other words, allocation would have been 25% higher had all Mission Requests been allocated tokens.) The mechanism appears to be working as intended, as prioritization is a larger challenge for DAOs than fully allocating resources. DAOs typically struggle to allocate resourcessustainably,  under-resourcing core work and over-resourcing non-core work.image984×210 23.5 KBWe received feedback that one week was not long enough to assess all Mission Requests. In order to reduce the cognitive overhead required of delegates while still maintaining the velocity of Voting Cycles (important for shipping protocol upgrades):Budget information will be displayed on the voting interfaceA dynamic spreadsheet will be provided to assess the impact of different rank orderingsThe Collective Feedback Commission and Grants Council will propose Mission Requests in a suggested rank order, which delegates can either replicate or override based on their own preferencesWe received some delegate feedback on adjusting the quorum lower. It is currently set to 51% of the 30% quorum (~13.5M OP.) If there is a strong argument that an exception needs to be made to set quorum lower for Mission Requests than on all other proposal types, suggested changes will be considered. However, since there were only 5 Mission Requests that failed to reach quorum (12% of total), it doesn’t appear that this is a significant barrier and the current plan is not to change the quorum in Season 6.We have updated the voting guide to make the mechanism clearer:Mission Request Voting GuideApplying to Mission RequestsThe Grants Council processed grants in two cycles during Season 5. We received feedback that this was too slow and, therefore, frustrating for applicants. In Season 6, applications should be processed every 3-6 weeks, on a rolling submission basis.The Grants Council received 314 applications in the first cycle of grants, relative to a comparable 376 proposals in all of Season 4. This demand was partially due to the nearly three month downtime between grant application processes which created a large application backlog, another reason it’s important to limit downtime between grants cycles.However, the Grants Council also received 234 applications in the second grants cycle, indicating strong and persistent demand for Governance Fund grants.The Foundation conducted grant applicant research, identifying many areas for process improvement, which have been shared with the Grants Council and should inform Season 6 operations. Some of these suggestions are included below:There was a lot confusion stemming from a misalignment in governance and grants calendars. Applicants should only need to reference one calendar in Season 6, and there should be no periods of overlapping deadlines. Start dates, deadlines, and decision dates will be made clear from the start of the Season.We need to improve the discoverability of key application information, streamlining and simplifying communications on one platform and ensuring communications are consistent between the Foundation and the Grants Council.The need for applicants to understand the difference between builders and growth grants should be eliminated as all applicants may now submit hybrid applications.Selecting Mission ApplicationsIn the first grants cycle, 13% of all applications were approved. In the second grants cycle, 24.5% of all applications were approved.This was the first Season the Developer Advisory Board was available to provide feedback to the Grants Council on grant applications under Intent#1. DAB feedback was helpful, but requested too late in the process during the first grants cycle. The DAB has adjusted its internal operations to make their final recommendations more useful to the Grants Council. You can see the DAB retrospectivehere.Tracking MilestonesThis Season there was a dedicated committee to track completion of Milestones.  This committee evaluated +300 milestones throughout Season 5.Cycle 10 was the first cycle of grants co complete the one year lock-up. No grants were clawed back! Cycle 11 had two applicants withdraw their applications and one of those applicants resubmitted a new grant application. All other grants successfully completed their milestones.The concept of benchmark milestones, in addition to critical milestones, may be eliminated in Season 6 as they caused confusion among applicants.Additional areas for improvement:There were some Mission Requests that didn’t receive competitive applications, in terms of either number or quality. This could be due to overly narrow or broad scoping of a Mission Request or the need to drive quality applicants to our grants program.Efforts to drive quality applications will be important to the success of Season 6.In short, we learned a ton from Season 5 and Missions v2! Thank you to everyone who participated in this iterative process. Much of your feedback and many of these learnings have been incorporated in the design ofMissions v2.5."
DappRadar DAO's participation within Optimism Collective,"IntroductionWarm greetings to the Optimism Collective community. Inspired byBase’s initial metagovernance manifesto, we at DappRadar DAO are thrilled to share our own: a strong statement that emphasizes our journey towards decentralization and a modus operandi regarding our future engagement with Optimism Collective.Why Optimism as Our First EngagementFor years, DappRadar has been a cornerstone in web3 adoption: getting users excited about promising projects, producing open data and educational resources across different ecosystems, and even maintaining critical node infrastructure.We are in the process of evolving from a centralized entity to a DAO, with a vision to build the World’s Dapp Store with RADAR and our community. This requires more active outreach with the ecosystem we seek to support.Inspired by both Optimism’s innovative approach to scaling permissionless, onchain activity (Superchain) and its dedication to funding public goods (Retro PGF), Optimism Collective provides an ideal forum for DappRadar DAO to implement and iterate our DAO-driven initiatives.Our Vision with OptimismOur vision in collaborating with Optimism is simple. DappRadar intends to earmark 3% of any Grant received (including our recent RetroPGF 3 award) to re-deploy into:Growth initiatives(utilizing our network and product to continue increasing education and engagement in Optimism Collective and Superchain) andGovernance initiatives(from participating in Proposals to delegating to aligned individuals and entities)By engaging with Optimism, we hope to also share learnings, as we progressively decentralize ourselves.ClosingWe warmly invite the Optimism community to read ourDappRadar DAO Metagovrernance Manifestoand join us in this exciting venture. We’ll work with Optimism Collective and our community to shape how this participation will evolve."
Onboarding OP Chains to Optimism Governance,"Welcoming More OP Chains to the CollectiveLast year, Optimism launched the Superchain, marking the transition from an ecosystem built around a single chain to a Collective aligned towards a shared Superchain vision. The first step towards this vision waswelcoming Base to the Collective. In addition to being an important contributor to the Collective, Base has set thestandardfor active governance participation among OP Chains.In 2024, we plan to bring 5-10 more OP Chains into the Collective increasing the number of high impact contributors building the Superchain. For example,Fraxis an early committer to the Superchain vision and we expect to welcome many more such OP Chains over the coming months.Onboarding OP Chains to GovernanceIncreasing the number of OP Chains not only benefits the ecosystem but further decentralizes the core protocol and governance system by adding additional, high impact contributors. Importantly, OP Chains provide particularly relevant insight into Protocol Upgrades, a core responsibility of the Token House. Given thedesignof Optimism governance, which supports capture resistance and effective resource allocation, the addition of OP Chains should strengthen the overall governance system.To support this goal, it is likely that new OP Chains receive grants from theEcosystem Fundto incentivize long term alignment with the ecosystem and active participation in Optimism Governance. It’s important that OP Chains have skin in the game and participate in the governance system to which they’ve entrusted the future of their chains. That said, an important property of our governance system is that no one stakeholder gain unilateral decision-making power. As with Base, the Foundation is taking a thoughtful approach to aligning incentives as we facilitate the onboarding of OP Chains as active participants in Optimism Governance.Encouraging Aligned ParticipationSome proactive measures include:Directing initial governance participation to occur through theChain Delegation Program, which includes important accountability mechanisms and will help new Chains build a track record of participation before unlocking voting power through their grants. A proposal to adjust and/or extend this program to better support this goal may be put forward to the Token House in the upcoming Reflection Period.Voting caps, based on % of votable supply, may be applied when appropriate. These caps may consider planned voting participation and delegation.The Foundation will recommend OP Chains delegate all or a portion of their voting power.In instances in which an OP Chain plans to vote directly, the Foundation will provide onboarding support to promote active participation.Base serves as an example of whatactive participationcan look like. All OP Chains will be strongly encouraged to take community feedback, attend community calls, and publish voting rationale and/or delegation frameworks.As always, it’s important to ensure all governance participants remain accountable to the Collective.All OP Chain delegates should upholdOptimist Expectationsand will be subject toCode of Conduct policiesand theRules of Engagement, along with all other votersTheAnticapture Commissionwas established in Season 5 to monitor the Token House for signs of capture and alert the Citizens’ House, the ultimate check on imbalances in the Token House, to any concernsToken grants do not confer any rights to participate in the Citizens’ House2024 will be an exciting year for the Superchain and Optimism governance! Onboarding additional OP Chains should accelerate ecosystem growth and strengthen our governance system. It remains very important that Optimism governance continues to represent a broad range of relevant stakeholders. As always, the Foundation remains open to suggestions related to the distribution of voting power and broad distribution of delegation."
The main differences between the Partner and the Seed fund?,"Dear OP forum,Recently I have been trying to map out the Optimism Collective and its stakeholders in a flowchart. Something that is not clear to me is what the exact purpose is of the Partner and the Seed funds which the OP foundation administers.Since thatBASE received around 10 million (1-year vest) & 106 million (6-year vest) OP grants from the Seed fund. Therefore, I was wondering what the main difference is between the Partner and the Seed fund is that the OP Foundation Administers.Hope to receive some answers from the OP community soon!,Bless 0xR"
How Base will participate in Optimism Governance,"Written by Jesse Pollak, Creator of BaseTl;dr.Base will participatein Optimism governance to ensure the stability and integrity of the OP Stack andSuperchain. We are also helping create theLaw of Chainsto lay a foundation for defining the Superchain and backing public goods funding. As we further hone our approach for governance participation, we invite the community to share their thoughts.Some highlights on how Base will contribute to public goods and the Optimism Collective:Base will join the Optimism Collective and programmatically contribute 15% of net revenue to fund public goods.As part of our participation and contribution to the Optimism Collective, Base will have the opportunity to earn up to 2.75% of the OP token supply over the next six years. This will enable us to participate as an active, accountable and engaged governance member.As part of our continued commitment to decentralization, our voting power will be limited to no more than 9% of the total votable supply. This 9% includes both potential delegation to others and our direct participation.Over the next few months, we aim to create a detailed plan around how we plan to participate in governance. Before we define our commitment to participation, we want to actively start a dialogue with the community and would appreciate thoughts, comments, and general feedback around the following points.How do you think Base should participate in Optimism governance?How can we further the Superchain holding true to our values of decentralization andneutrality?What unique perspectives can Base bring to Optimism governance?How would you like to see us show up? What have you seen work well with other participants?What are ways we can better solicit input and feedback from the community?We look forward to hearing your thoughts. Please feel free to share feedback by commenting on this post."
The Future of Optimism Governance,"The Optimism Foundation recently published this as apost on our Mirror blog. We’re reposting here in full for feedback and discussion from the community.The Future of Optimism GovernanceThe Optimism Collective is governed by a two-house system. The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens’ House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don’t involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents’ incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it’s highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are intended as starting points for discussion.Governance GoalsThere are two primary goals of Optimism’s governance system:Capture resistance.Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.Resource allocation.Governance’s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective’s vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision & value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.Design PrinciplesDesign decisions for the Collective’s governance system should be made in line with three key principles:Governance minimization. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.Iteration. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.Forking. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn’t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract arewhat makes decentralized platforms valuable, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.Balance. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters’ incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.Impact = profit.A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.Design OverviewThe responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system:Capture ResistanceandResource Allocation. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.The OptimismToken Houseis made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective’s decision making.In contrast to the Token House, theCitizens’ Houseuses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens’ House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals – decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens’ House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation’s stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.So: what does governance… well, govern?Problem Space#1:Capture ResistanceOptimism Governance’s first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is “in charge.”The responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:hard powers:governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, andsoft powers:social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community’s ability to fork.1/ Hard powersProtocol Upgradesrefer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism’s core protocol functionality.Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack’s functionality. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens’ House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens’ House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.Sequencer Selectionis the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens’ House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens’ House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.Citizenship Eligibilityis the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens’ House of Optimism Governance.Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens’ House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens’ House or moves to consolidate power.To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens’ House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens’ House.2/ Soft powersCode of Conduct Enforcementis the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes anRFP for Code of Conduct research, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation’s role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism’s voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who’ve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.Director Removalis the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.Problem Space#2:Resource AllocationThe second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective’s resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue2/ OP Treasury Management3/ RetroPGF FundingAllocation of Protocol Revenueis the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens’ House.Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens’ House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a “growth” stage or “value” stage.OP Treasury Allocationis the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:TheGovernance Fund, which is directed by Token House governance.TheRetroPGF Fund, which is directed by Citizens’ House governance, subject to a Token House veto.TheSeed FundandUnallocatedportions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.Foundation Budget Approvals, which are governed jointly by both houses.Inflation adjustments, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens’ House veto.This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.RetroPGF Grantsare the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:RetroPGF Scope: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.Project Allocations: the ability of the Citizens’ House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens’ House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism’s growth.Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:3840×1921 572 KBAdditional NotesIncompletenessThe list above does not include all governance powers – it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented. It is highly likely that the Collective will learn from initial experiments towards this blueprint and may make modifications to the processes outlined here. These “Problem Spaces” are intended as starting points for discussion, not as a prescriptive roadmap.Checks, balances, and vetosThis post also excludes crucial design details about veto power, approval and quorum thresholds, proposal defaults, and failure modes. In particular, it’s important to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto threshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a simple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right settings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.These details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning system, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from crypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances of Optimism Governance’s success. If you’re interested in contributing to these efforts, you’re welcome to reach out tobobby@optimism.ioor chime in on the governance forums.Citizenship and captureSince Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it’s paramount that the Citizens’ House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be discussed in greater detail in a future post.Key MilestonesOptimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and sustainable system. Here are some of the next milestones for the Collective in the coming quarters:Season 5 [2024]Sequencer Allowlist / Law of ChainsSeason 5 will introduce the governance system’s power to welcome new Sequencers into the Superchain. More information about sequencer governance (and its relation to chain, user, and platform governance) will be shared in the coming weeks.Joint-House votingIn Season 5, the Collective will bring the Citizens’ House fully online and execute its first set of joint-house votes. After executing three rounds of RetroPGF, this milestone will mark the next stage of maturity for the Citizens’ House as they participate in Optimism Governance beyond RetroPGF grant allocations.Security Council v1Season 5 will also include the Optimism Security Council. The Security Council is a set of community members tasked with executing protocol upgrades at the will of governance. This replaces the multisig wallet controlled by the Optimism Foundation and marks an important milestone in protocol decentralization.Season 6 [2024]Protocol Revenue AllocationSeason 6 will introduce the initial process for votes to allocate Protocol Revenue. It’s possible this process will include the introduction of a Treasury Council responsible for making high-level proposals to governance about how to allocate resources; any proposal for protocol revenue allocation will be submitted to the Token House for approval, and to the Citizens’ House for veto.Onchain treasury executionIn Season 6, parts of the Optimism Treasury will move onchain. This means governance will be able to initiate transactions that move tokens from the OP Token Treasury entirely onchain. As noted above, this onchain execution will begin with an emergency safeguard that will be removed in future seasons."
Retro Delegate Rewards: Season 4,"Retro Delegate Rewards: Season 4Thank youA huge thank you is due to delegates for their continued dedication to experimentation and iteration. This Season, the Collective aligned around Collective Intents and increased the number of non-core teams building the Collective with the introduction of Missions. The Grants Council, renewed for a second Season, processed an incredible 448 grant applications! Votable supply of OP increased from 40M to 69M and it was the first full Season voting onAgora! The Citizens’ House expanded to ~138 badgeholders and will reward 30M OP inRetroPGF Round 3.Why Retroactive Rewards?The Optimism Collective rewards delegates retroactively. Retroactive rewards are a core pillar of the large scale experiment to establish a new, regenerative economic system within the Collective.Retroactive rewards will be the primary contribution reward mechanism in the Collectiveand when the Governance Fund runs out of OP (as it is intended to), RetroPGF will need to support all activity in the Collective.Feedback on retro delegate rewards is extremely helpful in refining what will be the primary reward mechanism in the Collective. Delegates have requested more insight into the actions that are likely to be considered high impact in the upcoming Season, similarly to how RetroPGF Scope and Collective Intents are defined.  There have also been several discussions about setting expectations for high impact delegate/badgeholders. Please see theAnticapture Commission, a first step towards defining the highest impact delegates and empowering them with additional resources.Other reasons for maintaining retroactive delegate rewards:The amount of participation required will continue to vary dramatically as governance experiments evolve Season over Season. Retroactive rewards are better able to adapt to this level of iteration.Rewards that are allocated retroactively are not subject to a lock-up.Thank you to your continued dedication to this experiment to retroactively reward impact. Being a delegate requires a serious time commitment and the Collective strongly benefits from your engagement.The below criteria recognizes top delegates in Season 4 (snapshot as of 9/7/23, the start of the last Voting Cycle of the Season, in which there were no votes.)Delegates that meet the below criteria are eligible to receive a rewards as outlined in the below chart.Top 100 delegates by voting power (this has been adjusted from delegates with >0.25%, based on delegate feedback.)Protocols in the Protocol Delegation Program that qualified as top 100 delegates only as a result of Foundation delegations are not eligible for rewards.CriteriaDefinitionReasoningOPParticipated in Season 4>70% voting participation in Season 4 (abstain votes count towards participation).

In Season 3, the Foundation provided retroactive rewards to the Grants Council for their outsized impact as the Foundation proposed the Council’s initial budget. Since the Council now proposes its own budget, and Token House Seasons are now aligned with RetroPGF rounds, it is important that the Council’s impact be assessed by the Collective and rewarded via RetroPGF. The Grants Council is encouraged to apply as a project in Round 3, so that the Collective may reward the impact the Grants Council created in Season 4.Qualifying delegatesTop 100 Delegates (All reward amounts in OP)> 70% Voting Participation (Baseline rewards)Reflection Period ParticipationSupported MissionsTotalLinda Xie6,0003,0001,00010,000Polynya6,0003,0001,00010,000Synthetix ambassadors6,0003,0001,00010,000L2BEAT6,0003,0001,00010,000Jack Anorak6,0003,0001,00010,000GFX Labs6,0003,0001,00010,000Lefteris Karapetsas6,0003,0001,00010,000PoolCollective6,0006,000Michael Vander Meiden6,0003,0009,000404 DAO6,0003,0001,00010,000Boiler Blockchain6,0003,0009,000Olimpio6,0003,0001,00010,000Blockchain@USC6,0003,0001,00010,000PGov6,0006,000Katie6,0003,0001,00010,000Griff Green6,0003,0001,00010,000*Velodrome6,0003,0009,000*Paraswap6,0003,0001,00010,000*Pika6,0006,000*Rubicon6,0006,000*Polynomial6,0003,0009,000*GalxeIneligibleN/A*CliqueIneligibleIneligibleN/A*LyraIneligibleIneligibleIneligibleN/A*KyberswapIneligibleIneligibleN/A*GelatoIneligibleIneligibleN/AJoxes - DeFi LATAM6,0003,0001,00010,000Doug6,0003,0001,00010,000Gonna6,0003,0001,00010,000she2566,0003,0009,000The Wildfire Infrastructure Pod6,0003,0001,00010,000Solarcurve6,0003,0009,000Butterbum6,0003,0009,000L2226,0003,0001,00010,000StableNode6,0003,0009,000brichis.eth6,0003,0001,00010,000web3magnetic6,0003,0009,000ITU Blockchain6,0003,0001,00010,000ethdaily.eth6,0003,0009,000ceresstation.eth6,0001,0007,000mjs.eth3,0001,0004,000yoav.eth3,0001,0004,000Hop Protocol1,0001,000Minimal Gravitas6,0003,0001,00010,000Flipside Crypto3,0003,000Exosphere3,0003,000optimisticus.eth3,0003,000Nathan van der Heyden (Snapshot Labs)6,0003,0009,000Annymesh Mohanty3,0003,000Mikegriff3,0003,000yitong.eth3,0003,0000x Protocol Community Delegates3,0003,000Carnegie Mellon Blockchain Club3,0003,000Rabbithole6,0003,0009,000Penn Blockchain3,0003,000donnoh.eth3,0003,000jacob.willemsma.eth6,0006,000David Mihal6,0006,0000x71672e0d7d13384cf01737a68740733e852e8e986,0006,000kentf.eth6,0006,000mikegriff.eth6,0006,000*Signifies participant in the Protocol Delegation Program.

RetroPGF 3: Application Feedback,"This thread is to collect feedback on the RetroPGF 3 application processApplications for Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round 3 are live! You can applyhereand find guidelines on the application processhere. Applications will close on Oct 23rd.Iterating on Round 2 learningsBased on thelearnings and reflections from RetroPGF 2, we identified the challenge of gathering more high-quality data on projects to evaluate impact & profit. Feedback from Round 2 highlighted the need for greater alignment between the application form and the voting assessment process.SeeRetroPGF 3: Round Designfor an overview of the iterations that have been made based on Round 2 learnings.RetroPGF 3 Applications - gathering the correct data from ProjectsThe Optimism Collective is built on the axiom ofimpact=profit— the principle that positive impact on the Collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.To achieve this vision, the RetroPGF process should measure the impact projects provided to the Collective and the profit projects already generated from their impact. RetroPGF rewards are meant to fill the gap between a projects impact to the Collective and the profit they already received for that impact.The RetroPGF application form enables projects to self-report their impact & profit and provide references to relevant data sources. While the Collective has defined broad impact categories for RetroPGF, projects often have a more detailed understanding of how to measure the impact of their work, and it is important to empower them to surface their impact to badgeholders as they see fit.Impact statementThe RetroPGF application features a section called “impact statement”, in which projects can describe their contributions and the impact they provided to the Optimism Collective.See screenshot of the impact statementimage2000×3393 455 KBThe impact statement includes the following fields:Describe your contribution(s) to Optimism: A free-form text field in which projects can describe their contributionsContribution links: Projects can highlight external resources relating to their contributionsImpact category: Projects are asked to pick one or multiple of the Round 3 categories that best describe their impactImpact description: A free-form text field where projects can describe the impact their contributions provided to the Optimism CollectiveImpact metrics: Projects can highlight qualitative or quantitive metrics that highlight the impact of their contributionsAllowing projects to reference standardized external resources, such as Github Repos and onchain contracts, can power community-built data analytics tools to calculate projects’ impact using a variety of different approaches and formulas.Impact metrics try to support the evaluation process by giving badgeholders measurable insights into the impact of a project, instead of solely relying on qualitative descriptions.Grants & FundingThe Grants and Funding section tries to collect information relevant to the profit side of the impact = profit equation. The main goal is to understand the funding projects have already received for their impact.See screenshot of the Grants & funding sectionimage2000×1039 127 KBProjects can add one or multiple grants and funding sources.For each grant/funding source, they can select from different categories (Governance fund, Partner fund, RetroPGF 2, RetroPGF 1, or “other”) and provide an amount and a description of the grant/funding they received.While projects can volunteer information on investments they received, in this round the application form and guidelines do not require projects to report this information. The reasoning behind this is that venture investment is made in exchange for ownership in a project and, therefore, should not be considered as profit.The application form does not collect information relevant to means testing (see Vitalik’sReview of Optimism retro funding round 1). Means testing tries to understand the means a project has at their disposal and how reliant projects are on RetroPGF rewards to continue their work.  By rewarding with the expectation of future work, means testing leans more towards proactive grant giving. As the main experiment here is to reward contributionsretroactively, RetroPGF 3 experiments with deprioritising collecting information relevant to means testing. If badgeholders finds this to be limiting in reviewing projects for RetroPGF 3, the Collective may iterate on this in future rounds.Call for FeedbackDoes the application form provide a smooth experience for applicants? Are there possible hurdles or unnecessary friction?Is the application form aligned with the review process of applications?Does the information provided by projects help badgeholders review their impact & profit?"

Grant Misuse Reporting Process,"IndexOptimism Grant Misuse Reporting ProcessWhat is the Grant Misuse Reporting Process?DefinitionsScope of ProcessReport CriteriaGrant Misuse Report ProcessProcess OverviewConsiderations When Making a ReportProtection for Involved PartiesReport ValidationGrant Misuse Report TemplateOptimism Grant Misuse Reporting ProcessIn decentralised ecosystems it can be hard to stay on top of Grant usage and milestone execution. It is important that grant recipients are accountable to the Collective in order for Optimism to maintain a sustainable & healthy governance system.As the Optimism ecosystem expands there will be (and has been) a growing need to be able to find, track and call out these Grant Misuses. This process is intended to help the reporting community members (”Reporters”) to come forward with objective evidence based reports of Grant misuses in a safe and objective way.This is the first iteration of this process, and the process will evolve with each season (much like everything else) to support theOptimism Collective’sneeds.What is the Grant Misuse Reporting Process?Reporters reveal information about or bring attention to potential misuse of Collective Grants.TheseReports ARE anonymous.Reporters need to use accounts that are not associated with their real identity (Reporters are responsible for maintaining their own anonymity). Reports and evidence provided should be trustless. The Reporter should be inconsequential to the report as the evidence provided should be undeniable.In line with this,only onchain actions can be reported through this process(see Validation Requirements). If you are looking to report someone for non Grant related offchain behaviour, please see theRules of Engagement.Where a Report is determined to be valid and enforceable, the penalty will be for both the Project (team or dapp) and the founding members listed in the Grant to be recorded in the public “Misuse Reports Database” labeled under the severity of Misuse (see Definitions). This will allow Delegates, Badgeholders & Citizens to make informed decisions on future grants.DefinitionsFor the purpose of this process we use the following definitions:Team: The group, individual or project team that received the Grant.Commitment: The agreement or formal representations and public commitments the Team used to receive granted tokens or be allocated tokens (seeScope of Process).Misuse: In this process, the term “misuse” is defined in levels of severity, starting from least severe to the most. Misuse must be in relation to a Commitment. Only Grants made from March 2023 onward can be reported in this system.Failure to meet Critical Milestones: TheGrants Councilis responsible for checking critical Milestone completions. As such, failure to meet Milestones is NOT in scope of misuse. The sole exception to this are Season 4 Missions (which are out of scope for theGrants Council), which may be reported for “Missing Milestone(s)”.Breaking Commitments: Using tokens differently from Commitments is against the grant policies.Minor violations:Where meaningful, good faith steps have been taken to execute on the Commitments consistent with their spirit, but Commitments are still breached, the Grantee has committed a “minor violation” — i.e., a mild deviation on the specified execution plan.An example of this could look like changing execution plans (in line with the spirt of Commitments) but without approval from the Collective or the applicable Committee. A specific example could be changing the mechanism for sending tokens out in a user incentive campaign (like changing the number of users in a program, or the criteria for a competition, in a way that is still in line with the goal of the associated Commitments).Severe violations:The scope of severe Commitment violations should be limited to the following:Taking no action towards using tokens as defined in the associated Commitments (according to the timeline specified in the Commitment, or after 6 months).Using tokens for actions well outside of the scope of the associated Commitments. Actions that constitute “well outside the scope” are actions that were not defined in the Commitments, or are substantial and impactful deviations from the specified execution plan in the Commitments.A specific example could be changing the target, so if the grant was originally targeting end users but is now being used for a partnership, or was originally for development of a feature or integration but the grant is now being used for user incentives.Using bots or other manipulative means to fulfil Milestones, or otherwise inflate metrics or mislead the Collective in terms of the Teams progress towards execution.No Sale Violation: Violation of theno sale policy, from the date of implementation (March 2023) forward. Please see the “No Sale Policy” in the Grant Policies for specifics.Scamming or Rugs: There are a few definitions of scamming:Note that scams or rugs MUST have received or applied for a Grant fromThe Optimism Collectiveto be covered under this process. See “Report Criteria” for more info.Scamming users, or using tokens to scam users. Scamming meaning taking user or Collective assets without providing advertised services, or taking more assets than agreed on (also called “draining” a wallet).Applying for a Grant/Mission with a fake project or team, impersonating a team and other activity taken to intentionally mislead the Collective or community (e.g: serial scammers).Scope of ProcessThis Reporting Process only covers grants made, and corresponding tokens allocated, by the Optimism Token House. For example, RetroPGF recipients are currently outside the scope of this process (in their capacity as such). The scope may expand to include other programs in the future.Report CriteriaThe following criteria set aims to ensure reports are relevant to the ecosystem, while balancing potential process abuse or spam.The project, individual, or accused action MUST have taken place on the Optimism network AND with tokens granted by the Optimism Token House.While scams and other abuses, wherever they may take place, are regrettable, this Reporting Process is not designed to capture everything all at once.The Grant Misuse amount in question MUST be equal to or more than 50k OP or $50k USD if not denominated in OP.This minimum is for the amount that has been misused, not the total grant amount. Handling Reports is a time consuming process and should be taken seriously, given it may involve accusations that go to the reputation and credibility of a grant recipient.The activity MUST have taken place onchain, AND be provable onchain.Reports need to meet a high level of objective proof. Sadly, off chain activities are incredibly difficult to prove in a trustless manner, and introduce significant amounts of subjectivity. Note that additional offchain evidence (such as messages) can be used tosupplement a claim, but the main evidence for a claim MUST be onchain.Information provided MUST be publicly verifiable.If you do submit screenshots of messages, one should be able to verify it. For example, a screen shot of a Discord server messages are verifiable, DM messages are not.The action MUST have taken place in the last 12 months.Reports should be lively. Reports on Grant Misuse activities that took place far in the past can create uncertainty and duplication, while bogging down the Report evaluation system.The action MUST not already have an active or already reviewed Report.If there is an existing Report please add your evidence to that report. New reports on existing topics will get rejected.If the matter being Reported has already been reported and resolved (regardless of the outcome), the matter will be considered “closed” for the purposes of this process, and cannot be reopened by a new Report.Grant Misuse Report ProcessNote:Keep in mind that this Reporting process does not protect you against any legal commitments (such as confidentiality) or obligations (not to defame) that you may have in the context of the information you choose to submit in your Reports.Process OverviewThe Report is posted in the Governance Form under “Grant Misuse Reports”.  The Report will be unlisted (private) for a maximum of 3 days while it is checked.During this Hold Period (the first 3 days after the report is submitted) the report is checked and the accused is attempted to be notified.Report Checking: The report MUST conform to the template provided in this document. Reports that do not follow the template will be rejected irrespective of report validity. Reports can be resubmitted to conform with the template.Accused notification: During the Hold Period the accused will be sent the report and given opportunity to respond on the forum. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord, Discourse, etc, whatever communication line was provided in the original Grant) by an official Optimism account.Report posted publicly.After the Hold Period the report is filed publicly in the governance forum under the “Grant Misuse Reports” section.The Report is validated publicly over a maximum of 6 weeks (see Report Validation for details).During the Validation phase the Reporter may be asked to provide further detail or clarify points. This MUST all happen publicly. Attempts to DM the Reporter will be considered as acting with hostility. In turn, the Reporter may NOT DM the accused, as this will also be seen as acting with hostility.Hostility towards or attacks against a good faith Reporter will be considered a Severe Violation of theRules of Engagementand may result in the infringer’s removal from Optimism platforms. See theRules of Engagementfor more info.Outcome of a report.If the report is validated, the Team (group, individual or project team that received the grant) are added to the “Misuse Reports Database”.If the report fails validation the report is noted as invalid, but no further action is taken against the team or Reporter and nothing is added to the database.Considerations When Making a ReportThe process for submitting a Report is relatively straightforward.Create a doc with the template provided later in this document. Ensure every claim has a transaction or supplementary evidence, and that your report follows the Report Criteria, and meets the specified Misuse Definition. Make sure your report is clear and as simple to follow as possible.All reports posted in the reporting section will be hidden by default. You are responsible for maintaining your own anonymity, so ensure you are on the correct account BEFORE posting.If your post does not comply with the guidelines or template it will be removed during the Hold Period, and you will be notified. You are free to update the report in line with the feedback you receive and resubmit.Report MUST be factual. Do not editorialize with opinions, subjective statements, or derogatory adjectives.Reports that contain inflammatory language or unsubstantiated claims do not meet the guidelines and will be removed. Accusations and discussions around the report should ONLY happen on the post on the governance forum. Discussions in other platforms (such as Discord) can be seen as harassment or intimidation and may constitute a violation of theRules of Engagement.Protection for Involved PartiesReportersReporters should be available to answer questions during the verification phase. Reporters are only expected to respond to public requests for information, and are encouraged to report harassment (both public and private) immediately.Any harassment of a good faith reporter will be treated as a Severe Violation of theRules of Engagementand may result in the harassers’ removal from all Optimism platforms.Should the accused reach out to the Reporter directly, the accused will immediately be in violation of theRules of Engagement(see Intimidation) and will result in their suspension from all Optimism platforms. This will happen regardless of if the accused has responded to the report yet.AccusedThe accused party or project will be notified of the Report before it goes public. The accused will have the Hold Period to pull together a response, or counter evidence. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord, Discourse, etc) by an official Optimism account.Note that the accused may not attack or even address the reporter, and are ONLY allowed to respond to the evidence provided. Accused may ONLY refer the the reporter as “the Reporter”.The accused will be notified once the Hold Period is completed, so that they may have the opportunity to be the first response to the Report.Note that the response can only respond to the evidence or narrative provided in the Report. If a response attacks or addresses the reporter (see reporter protections) the response will be removed, and the accused may be suspended from all Optimism platforms.NumbaNERDsAny attempts to DM the NumbaNERDs from either the Reporter or Accused (or associated team) will be considered harassment. All communication MUST happen through the public post and address evidence directly.Report ValidationReports are validated by the NumbaNERDs (a collective of contributors focused on analytics).To disprove or invalidate provided transaction evidence one must prove:The claim misrepresents what happens in the transaction or the transaction had been approved by governance. I.e: if funds are withdrawn from an address but this was a governance approved withdrawal and not a rug.That the provided transaction(s) are not related to the claim or are described in a way that mislead readers as to the nature of the transaction. I.e: the transaction provided is an NFT transfer not a funds transfer.The amount in question is found to be below the required minimum. I.e: The report misrepresented the total amount in question.The Report does not meet any of the standards laid out in the Report Criteria.Anyone can post evidence to prove or disprove elements of a report, however only NumbaNERDs can ultimately Validate or Invalidate a claim. Supporting evidence can be disproven, however this will not get a report invalidated.Validation requirementsA GovNERD will ensure the report follows the template, does not contain inflammatory language, and is not a duplicate report.If the Report is invalid, the reporter will be notified.If the Report is valid, an Optimism admin will notify the accused from an official account.Is the claim labeled correctly? i.e if it is “Scams & Rugs” does it fit the definition?At least 3 NumbaNERDs will independently verify the onchain transactions & evidence to ensure it supports the claims being made.Is the amount in question reaching the required minimums? (see report Criteria)Does the evidence support the claim? Is there enough onchain data to back up the claim?If the claim is Valid the govNERDs will play the administrative role of adding the Report to the Database. If the claim is invalid, no action is taken.Verification of a report cannot take longer than 6 weeks in order to limit the process to a reasonable amount of time. If at the end of the 6 weeks a report is not Validated OR Invalidated, it is archived as “Undecided” and will not be added to the database.Whether a report is Valid, Invalid or Undecided, a new report CANNOT be made for the same misuse. If new evidence is discovered, it can be submitted to the existing report. This will reopen (or extend) the review period by 3 weeks in which the new evidence can be reviewed. If the report is found Invalid or Undecided after this 3 week period the matter is considered settled and cannot be reopened.Reports in the database will not be removed as there is no direct consequence of being listed in the database (it does not result in an automatic future grant freeze, for example). Rather this database alerts governance participants to consider the reports when making future grant decisions.Grant Misuse Report TemplateGrant Misuse Report TemplateBefore filling out a Report please make sure you have read and understand the “Report Criteria” as well as “Protections for Involved Parties” and “Definitions”. Reports submitted that fail to meet the required criteria will be removed.Accusation:What Misuse the Accused is being accused of.I.e:Misuse: Violating the No Sale rule on tokens received from the Projects Grant proposal (link to proposal).Total Amounts:For ease of verification, the total amount of tokens or funds in question.I.e:Total token/funds involved: 100,000.00 OP from Token House Grant (linked to grant application).Total grant amount misused: 75,000.00 OP Sold for USDC (TX 20 JAN 2023).ORTotal token/funds involved: $ 65,000.00 USDC of stolen user fundsTotal token/funds misused: $ 65,000.00 USDC user funds stolen (funds were stolen in a complex batch of transactions listed below).Breakdown of misused token/funds:$2,000.00 taken from liquidity pool through admin withdrawal: TX on 20 JAN 2023etc…Note that the use of the $ is prohibited in connection with “OP.” SeeImportant Term documentationfor more information.Summary:A summary of the activity. This should be a concise description of WHAT the involved parties are accused of as well as the main evidence of the claim. Try keeping this under 1000 words.I.e:The project “Proj3ct” received a Grant from the Token House (TX on the 20 OCT 2023) with the following objectives: “Increase usage on “Proj3ct” through a user generated content competition”.However, “Proj3ct” misused their grant by violating the “No Sale rule”.After “Proj3ct” received their tokens they transfered them to Coinbase over 3 transactions (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023). Each time the address received USDC (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023).When community members asked about these transactions, the team attacked them personally (see supplementary evidence 5).Summaries should be:Clear, easy to follow and contain all the essential information, such as:What the accused had agreed to do in their Commitment.What the specific misuse was.The main evidence of the misuse claim (with transactions, times & dates provided in UTC). Please write out months as 3 letters: DD MMM YYYY. Do NOT use DD.MM.YY or MM.DD.YY formats to avoid confusion.Not contain any personal attacks against the accused, nor make any unsubstantiated claims about the projects or its team.Involved Parties:The offending address(es).Link between project and address(es) should ALWAYS start with the address provided in the Commitment or other provided addresses in the Commitment.Links between individuals and addresses MUST be undeniable (i.e an ENS name as their handle, using the address to apply for Grants in an ecosystem, etc).If you do not have ONLY onchain evidence of a link between an individual and the address(es) then refrain from making this link. Please exercise extreme caution when linking identities to address, as you are still bound by the DOXXing definitions and consequences in theRules of Engagement. Reports that DOX anyone will be censored (to remove identifying information). If unsure if the information is DOXXing, use the handles/identities used in the gov forum, or simply refer to addresses.I.e:0x123… → Address provided by “Proj3ct” in their Grant application.0x321… → Address that received the USDC. Address is suspected to be@fred42as the ENS name is fred42.eth, which is also associated with a twitter account by the same name. This is also their handle in the Optimism Governance forum used to post their Commitment.Timeline of events:What happened? This should be the bulk of your report. This should have a step by step timeline of what happened, and link directly to transactions. Try keeping each line item down to a single action. Multiple actions in a step may make the report difficult to follow. Format:Time:Description:Transaction:(optional) Supplemental Evidence:I.e:02:34 20 MAY 2023 UTCAddress 0x123… initiated a withdraw on project “Proj3ct” for $1 of their pools liquidity. This is testing the admin withdraw function.Transaction link.02:36 20 MAY 2023 UTCAddress 0x123… initiated a withdrawal for $65,000.00 of user provided pool liquidity.Transaction link.02:38 20 MAY 2023 UTCThe funds are moved into a Coinbase CEX account. The address is then shortly funded with USDC.Transaction to CEX.Transaction sending USDC.SupplementalEvidence:Evidence that is 1) publicly accessible, and 2) supports your timeline of events.For example, a Tweet from a community member asking about funds moving. This could also be links to previous cases of fraud by mentioned individuals. Only if absolutely necessary should DMs or non-public information be provided. All supplementary evidence must contain a link and a screenshot.SE 1:I.e:SE 1: Tweet from community member asking where the funds have gone.Link to tweet.Screenshot:"

Code of Conduct Council accountability reports S6,"Hello Optimism collective! The Code of Conduct Council for this season 6 is happy to present its mid-season report, where we made self evaluation of our role, and proposed insights from identified conflicting patterns. You can check our charterhere._1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?Reporter Experience KPIs:We have maintained a reasonable response time for most reports. Initial responses are typically provided within 48 hours. However, in some complex cases, particularly those requiring deeper investigation or coordination with other teams, response times have extended slightly, up to 5 days. Also the council considers that that the scope needs to be better communicated, as some reports have been outside of our competence and capacity.Number of reports that de-escalate without enforcement actions: So far, we have received 4 reports and managed to defuse most conflicts (around 90%) without the need for formal enforcement action. In cases where enforcement is required, we strictly adhere to the rules of engagement and provide transparency in all our decisions. You can review our summary of cases inthis postin the forum.No community members have disengaged from the community because of unmanaged conflicts in season 6, reinforcing our role in the Token House as a sensory node that identifies patterns, looks out for solutions, and provides feedback to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.Accountability and transparency around the due processing of cases: Regular updates on case handling have been shared on the forum. All cases are documented with detailed reports on the actions taken, maintaining transparency and accountability.Number of updates to charters and operating procedures: there was one significant update to our charter, where we made more precise the enforcement of sanctions. Ongoing discussions highlight the need to propose some changes, planning for the coming growth phase of the superchain and the evolving governance framework of Optimism.Availability and ease of access to the council: We have provided availability for the community to raise concerns to the council and its members. Participation in office hours was lower than expected, but we continue to promote these sessions to increase visibility and still provide accessibility. We also want to Invite other communities to our office hours, so that we can cross pollinate and promote good practices within the superchain.Performance KPIs:Number of community members leaving due to unmanaged conflict:We have not observed any significant resignations or departures due to unresolved conflicts. We aim to maintain this standard by continuing proactive engagement.Token votes related to conflict management actions:So far, no council members have been dismissed or challenged through the Representative Removal proposal mechanism, reflecting strong trust in the CoCC’s operations and decisions.Separation of conflict visibility from the collective:We have maintained a high level of confidentiality, ensuring that conflicts are handled privately until resolution, with public announcements made only when necessary, in accordance with the Charter guidelines. In that sense, we are actively contributing to the perceived well being of the collective.2. Impact assessment - how well did your team’s outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?The CoCC has successfully upheld its mandate in managing conflicts while maintaining a focus on decentralization and community-driven governance. Our proactive efforts, such as offering early guidance and mediation before conflicts escalate, have been highly effective. Additionally, our monthly office hours have allowed us to engage directly with the community, ensuring we remained accessible. While office hours can foster greater visibility of the council and its work, in practice, reports do not usually occur in public and synchronous spaces.The CoCC has conveyed a sense of rigor and fairness in the community that has influenced the perceived well-being of this season 6. Not having huge emergencies can be considered a good sign, and we are ready and available for any cases that arise, big and small.We are individually studying every case that is reported, acting as sensory nodes for the community and the foundation, and besides promoting short term solutions, we are identifying valuable feedback and improvement opportunities to consolidate the recommendations listed as final points of this post.We consider that the impact of our work should not be isolated from the work of other councils and groups that are key for the sustainability of the organization, so we highlight our efforts towards interconnection, composability, and complementarity between the CoCC and all governance structures. Our impact is to be a support wheel so that all other stakeholders can coordinate and overcome difficulties.3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP’s)?We propose adding stronger guidelines for communication in public forums and Discord channels to prevent escalations arising from abusive language or harassment.The current scope of the CoCC is clear, but there is a need to further focus on filling governance gaps as the superchain grows. We need to think in emergent areas of conflict related to the expanding complexity of the superchain, to promote clear boundaries for what is shared and what is not shared between chains, and consolidate good practices.There should be more connection between the CoCC and the provision of mediation by third parties. Currently they are expected to be of easy access to the community with their own forms and presence, but we consider that managing two forms separately is harder than managing one, in which cases are then delegated to the right team. We think having just one form could avoid double accountability, asymmetry of information, and arbitrary callings to the mediation third party.4. Suggested Changes to the Charter:Create strategies to increase and measure Interconnection between the CoCC and other teams. Eg: Visibility of the council’s availability during community spaces, collaborations with other councils and governance teams, and activity of the council lead to feedback activities.Furthermore, clearer guidelines regarding sanctions—specifically the process and criteria for issuing warnings, temporary suspensions, and other enforcement actions—should be further detailed in the CharterCoCC was not included in retroactive funding for Season 6, we believe that our ongoing contributions to the governance framework should be considered for inclusion in retroactive funding for Season 7.We suggest to position the COCC as the main place for complaints in the collective, with the role of connecting requests to the pertinent parties, and ensuring that all cases have due diligence and are properly processed and translated into improvements.5. Self evaluation:The first area where we can improve is making our processes more visible to the community, to more clearly demonstrate the impact of our work and strengthen trust in the council.Once elected, the council should meet twice a week for the first few months to allow for members to get even information and context for prevention and case intake. This role requires onboarding for new representatives so that handoff of information between seasons happens gracefully.We can strengthen collaboration between the CoCC and other governance bodies, because even though we have good communication paths with them, enhancing the composability aspect can create higher value than the sum of its parts.Conflict Resolution Best Practices: Continue refining our preventive approach by introducing more proactive measures, such as hosting workshops or educational sessions for the community on conflict resolution and governance. This includes consolidating evergreen content for the Optimism collective, and promoting standards for the superchain.Perception of value and self-inflicted pressure: Since the impact of our work is harder to measure than other contributions, there has been some self-inflicted pressure on the members of the CoCC to validate our work. We think that raising awareness about the value being brought to the collective by the CoCC can reduce the stress on council members on meeting expectations.Even when we would like to include enthusiasts in the community that want to support us with what we do, we decided to not mix our nature of an elected body that manages confidentiality with opening new contribution paths. We are open to collaborate with all existing contribution paths, but not stewarding any one.6. Recommendations:Including more proactive guidance on Web3 security and best practices. This can help prevent certain types of conflicts related to vulnerabilities or misunderstandings around blockchain security.Follow up on the announcement and execution of the education sessions by the Resolv3 team for season 6.There is a recurring pattern of conflicts related to grant allocation and perceptions of centralization or favoritism. We recommend increasing transparency in the grant process and continuously emphasizing decentralized governance.We have observed a rising trend of projects manipulating transaction volumes to create misleading on-chain activity. This could damage Optimism’s reputation. We suggest stricter guidelines regarding the reporting and evaluation of on-chain data.We have received concerns regarding the verification and legitimacy process for profiles and projects in funding rounds. We received a complaint about 5 artists Whose NFTs were plagiarized by false profiles who eventually got benefit in their place.On Information asymmetry. We have noticed that there is a delta between the foundation plans and contributors’ awareness. We think that even when it is intended to not overwhelm the community with too much complexity, it would be recommended to develop complexity tolerance, looking for preparation on progressive decentralization.On Composability of councils and governance efforts. Thanks to the seasonal cadence of Optimism, there is a fast rotation of elected representatives, and we consider that designing an onboarding path for these roles can help handing off information and carrying good practices between seasons. Creating a rich culture is what will keep the community together, even when rotating and decentralizing.On Superchain boundaries and interop in governance: As Optimism expands,the CoCC should collaborate to establish governance frameworks that are interoperable, respecting local contexts while adhering to core principles. Ensuring that we continue to provide a robust framework for conflict management within the ever-evolving Optimism ecosystem.On Communication styles: Early indications show that most cases reflect common patterns related to communication problems. We have noticed that contributors in different platforms sometimes express themselves in terms of Interpretation, Judgement, Strategy and demands. We consider that frameworks like Nonviolent communication (NVC) can be shared and practiced to help expressing in terms of observations, feelings, needs and requests, making it easier, both to understand, express, and negotiate effectively in a life enriching dialogue.Thank you for reading our mid-season report. We look forward to the rest of season 6 and the transition to season 7Remember that you can request support from the Code of Conduct Council at any time throughthis form, or contacting directly a member of the team."

Season 6: Code of Conduct Rescoping #2,"Special thanks to@teresacdfor review and feedback on this post as part of theFeedback CommissionSeason 6: Code of Conduct Rescoping # 2A Brief History of the Code of Conduct (CoC)Before we had a CoC, there were concerns about grant misusage and toxic interactions on our platformsWe created an enforceable CoC in the Token House, which was initially and temporarily enforced by the FoundationIn an attempt to decentralize enforcement, there were a few months where we experimented with the Token House voting onDelegate Suspensions. This experiment ultimately ended with a nearly unanimous abstention among delegates on the second, and last, such Suspension vote. Delegates do not want to vote directly on CoC matters.In Season 5, we introduced an experimental, electedCode of Conduct Council in the Token Houseto relieve delegates of this responsibility.Top delegates were skeptical this was the right solution (due to concerns aboutpowerandgovernance minimization) but approved the proposal in the name of experimentation.While experimenting with the Council in the Token House, the Foundation has beenresponsible for the CoC in the Citizens’ HouseRescoping Proposal#1In response to continued feedback, werescopedthe Code of Conduct at the start of Season 5 via the following actions:Most platform related violations (harassment, doxxing, slander, etc.) are now enforced via theRules of Engagement,which dictate the usage of Optimism hosted platforms. This allows these issues to be handled immediately via moderators, and not through lengthy governance processes.All unenforceable “should” statements were moved intoOptimist Expectations, to be enforced via the free market for delegation. This minimizes governance overhead and creates more appropriate consequences (losing delegation vs. suspension from platforms.)Collective Representative Removal was moved into theOperating Manualas a proposal type that allows all elected representatives to be removed from these positions at any time by the full Token House.Grant clawbacks, for locked builders grants, were placed under the purview of the Code of Conduct Council and theGrant Misuse Reporting Processwas established. This portion of the rescoping was voted on by the Token House as this change constituted a removal of proposal types from the Operating Manual.All that is now left in theCode of Conductare clauses relating toGrant Policiesand Self-dealing.The Grants Council Milestones and Metrics committee assesses the completion of milestones and compliance with theGrant Policies.It remains very important to limit self-dealing but the way self-dealing clauses are enforced via the Code of Conduct is nuanced.In the Token House, self-dealing results in delegate suspension from our platforms, but there is no-onchain enforcement impacting their voting power. We do not plan to implement any such on-chain enforcement to preserve tokenholder rights.In the Citizens’ House, badgeholders may have their voting power removed for self-dealing as the Foundation currently administers voting badges. However, this ability will not exist in the future as the criteria granting the right to be a Citizen will be determined via governance.Rescoping#2:A Return to Governance MinimizationInformed by conversations with the Code of Conduct Council and ongoing learnings throughout the course Season 5, the Code of Conduct will be further rescoped, and as outlined below, to ensure accountability in a governance minimized way.The Foundation may issue a Mission Request to support alternative dispute resolution, to limit the need for escalation to the point of enforcement to begin with.The Metrics and Milestone subcommittee of the Grants Council will process allGrant Policyviolations, subject to optimistic approval by the Token House. The Grants Council has more context and a higher ability to assess grant related violations than any other party and the Token House will retain optimistic approval rights over these decisions.Self Dealing policies will be primarily enforced via the free market for delegation, incentive design, and voting mechanisms.Self-dealing clauses will be moved intoOptimist Expectationsand voters in both Houses will continue to be expected to uphold these expectationsToken House self-dealing will be enforced via the free market for delegation, as alternative enforcement mechanisms do not carry on-chain consequences anywayCitizens’ House self-dealing will be addressed via incentive and voting design rather than enforced by the Foundation. The goal is to prevent, or account for, this behavior rather than police it. As these mechanisms are developed over time, the Foundation may still play a temporary role in enforcement mechanisms (such as badge removal). The ability of the Foundation to implement any enforcement actions will be specified at the start of each round given the unique considerations of distinct round designs.Round 4:Self-dealing will be limited by metrics-based voting as badgeholders will no longer vote on individual projectsRound 5:Expert evaluation presents unique challenges related to conflicts of interest and we are actively evaluating Mission Requests to aid in the design of this round.Voting design (Coming soon!)Incentive designRound 6:Self-dealing will be limited by voter selection methods and sampling, which makes it unlikely badgeholders would evaluate projects they’re affiliated withRound 7:Self-dealing will be limited by metrics-based voting as badgeholders will no longer vote on individual projectsThese changes do not require governance approval as they do not change any Token House voting rights.Finally, theRules of Engagementwill continue to be enforced, either by an elected Code of Conduct Council or by other moderators.Delegates will vote on their preferred option.Delegates may choose to approve an operating budget for the Code of Conduct Council to oversee the Rules of Engagement in Season 6, provided a prospective Lead puts forward a proposal to do so. If delegates do not believe an elected Council is necessary to enforce the Rules of Engagement, they should not approve the operating budget for a Code of Conduct Council.In the event that no operating budget is approved for a Code of Conduct Council, the supportNERDs will continue to monitor the forum and enforce the Rules of Engagement as they previously have. The supportNERDs are not appointed by the Foundation but rather operate through an open contribution path. If any decisions made by the supportNERDs are questioned, they may be appealed to a third party (likely the party contracted to provide mediation services.) Enforcement via random jury selection was considered but is not recommended due to the level of overhead required for what is essentially forum moderation.In evaluating the above options, it’s important to remember our constitutional principle of governance minimization. Councils necessarily increase governance overhead, which means the Collective can only support ~4-5 Councils and should use them sparingly. Council structures should be used only when well suited to the problem space (usually convex decision making.)With these changes, the same accountability system would remain intact, albeit without the need for centralized enforcement. Accountability would be maintained via mediation services, the free market for delegation, the milestones and metrics sub-committee, the public grant misusage process, moderation of the rules of engagement, and incentive and voting design. This minimizes governance overhead while ensuring accountability via a broad range of methods that decentralize enforcement power across many distinct parties.These changes would be implemented for the length of Season 6 but may be re-assessed and adapted based on learnings.Thank You to the Token House Code of Conduct CouncilWe’d like to thank to members of the Code of Conduct Council for their willingness to experiment and for the valuable work they’ve done in testing the Council structure as a potential solution to decentralizing Code of Conduct enforcement.Further information on renewing the Code of Conduct Council can be foundhere."
How to Contribute: OP Rewards Analytics,"BackgroundTo date, the Governance Fund has approved over 60M OP in total to incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. It is important for delegates and the broader collective to have access to transparent information that allows them to make data-driven decisions and understand how projects are allocating their OP rewards and evaluate their performance.The data team at OP Labs previously shared rewards analysis reports as part of the collective learning. For our March update, we set up an open-sourcerepository on GitHubwhere we’re building the code used to track token distributions, attribute project usage (Dune queries), and measure liquidity flows.When we announced that this repo was open for anyone to help build, the first question was“Where should people contribute?”This post aims to help potential contributors get started.You can find past reports:May 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics UpdateApr 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics UpdateMar 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics UpdateWe want to work with the community to refine our measurements and better understand the effective of token incentives.

Further details can be found in thesespells.For DeFi-related projects, tracking net TVL flows via APIs fromDeFiLlamaandThe Graph, as well as volumes throughdex.tradeson Dune.Metrics MethodologyIn the latest iteration, we evaluate the performance of an incentive program based on its impact on general usage (i.e., incremental transactions, addresses, and gas fees) and the goals it aims to achieve (e.g., liquidity mining, trading volume).The incremental impact is measured against the average performance of an app 30 days before an incentive program launch. Once the incentive program ends, we also assess its impact on usage and other goals in the 30 days following the program’s conclusion.To make it comparable, we then standardize the metrics above with running amount of OP distributed to measure impact per OP.This methodology gives us a set of common metrics to evaluate programs by, but it is far from perfect (See the Contribute section for how to help make it better). There can be factors that muddy what usage can be attributed to a program, such as overlapping incentive programs, and external forces that significantly alter usage patterns. These may also not even be the right measures to count, each app likely has detailed metrics that are more relevant for future growth. We will continue working with our community to refine our measurements to better understand the effectiveness of token incentives."
Guidance on Severe Violations of the Rules of Engagement,"0. SCOPEWhen talking about harassment it is important to understand who and what can be harassed. We believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. This means treating people with kindness regardless of what you think they have done (i.e., even if you think they are scamming others).No one deserves to be harassed.Harassment is about howyoutreatthemand has nothing to do with what they are doing.0.1 HARASSMENT VS. CRITICISMBefore we get into they types of harassment, let’s make the distinction between making a valid critique of an individual or project’s actions and harassment.EXAMPLESLaying out the facts with clear supporting evidence in an appropriate place, without including your personal opinion with the evidence.e.g.: Project XYZ transferred their funds on xx day, as you can see in this transaction 0x…. This action clearly violated the no sale rule outlined in the Operating Manual. I have started a thread in the Monitoring governance form, if anyone else has evidence please add it.Posting evidence on Twitter/Discord does not help in reporting destructive behavior. Arguing with people is not the correct way to report misconduct.This form of engagement often ends up as harassment. Please use the correct method for reporting, as laid out in the Rules of Engagement.In a highly public forum (like Discord) making  unsubstantiated claims using inflammatory, hostile, rude or otherwise emotional language, encouraging or outright calling others to take action individually rather than following the appropriate process.e.g.: Project XYZ is a scam and will steal all your money! The founders are all scammers and should never be allowed to make another project! Everyone should report them!1. CYBER BULLYINGThere are multiple ways you can cyber bully individuals and projects. They are all harmful and violate theRules of Engagement.1.1 PUBLIC HARASSMENTPublic harassment is attempting to make an individual or project look bad in a public space, such as Twitter or Discord. This kind of harassment often uses inflammatory and emotional language and may escalate to encouraging others to harass the individual as well (see 1.3).It may take the form of multiple Tweet threads or messages directly attacking the individual or project.EXAMPLESINDIVIDUAL🚫 This person is unqualified and a bad delegate, and if you delegate to them then you are what is wrong with the world.PROJECT🚫 This project is a scam and will rug you! The founders are terrible and should not be allowed back! @founderTo report public harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as screenshots of multiple instances of this type of behavior in a public platform.1.2 PRIVATE HARASSMENTPrivate harassment looks like intimidation. This could take the form of directly messaging an individual and threatening to report them, doxx or otherwise cause them distress. Private harassment is a repeated behavior (one message warning that you will be reported does not qualify).Private harassment is often done as a means to an end, for example threatening to release information if an individual does not perform a certain action (such as voting a specific way or sending funds). Private harassment does not need to have ulterior motives to qualify. Private harassment does require multiple offenses to qualify.To report private harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as screenshots of multiple direct messages.1.3 ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO HARASSEncouraging others to attack, harass or otherwise disrupt an individual or project also constitutes harassment.This may look like encouraging others to report a project or person on a platform (like Twitter, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, etc.). This is especially harmful during investigations as it may obscure evidence or escalate to doxxing.To report encouragement of harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as multiple screenshots of posts (on any platform) that encourage, suggest or otherwise imply that others should join in the harassment.2. DOXXINGPrivacy is a fundamental human right that the Collective takes seriously. Doxxing is searching for and posting or otherwise making publicly available any private or personally identifying information, in a public forum, where the information was not already available.The information does not have to be correct for it to constitute doxxing.2.1 PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATIONDoxxing includes sharing information that identifies a person, such as their real name, place of work, links to other profiles of theirs that have additional personal information (such as a LinkedIn profile), and the like.EXAMPLESally has her name as her handle in Discord (@Sally45), as well as having her PFP set to a photo of her. She is not anonymous, but she can still be doxxed.Sally and Fred get into an argument about a proposal that Sally posted. Fred is very upset, and finds Sally’s LinkedIn profile and obtains her last name. He then posts her full name in Discord, telling others she is a scammer.This is considered doxxing as Fred researched Sally with the intent of exposing her. He researched additional personal identifying information and then cross posted this information that was not available on Discord.Fred has doxxed Sally, and as such violated theRules of Engagement.To report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a screenshot of the offender posting personally identifying information in a public forum.2.1.1 LINKING INFORMATIONDoxxing includes searching for information about an individual that links their anon profile to their identity.This can look like posting a photo of an anon person (say, from a conference) and tagging their anon handle, thus linking their face to their handle. ALWAYS ask permission before posting photos that have other people in them.To report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a screenshot of the offender posting a photo or personally identifying information in a public forum.2.2 PHYSICAL LOCATIONDoxxing also includes publicly disclosing someone’s physical location. This can look like posting hotel rooms, home addresses, or place of work address (office address).To qualify as a physical location doxxing for purposes of violating theRules of Engagement, the location information needs to be specific enough for someone to reasonably find the person based off this information. Note that even if disclosing physical location does not amount to aRules of Engagement violation, it is still strongly discouraged.EXAMPLESSally lives in America.This is not doxxing as this information is too broad to find Sally. However, this kind of sharing is still strongly discouraged.Sally is attending ETHConference.This is not specific enough to cause Sally physical danger, or to be used to find her. However, this is strongly discouraged and may result in a warning. If the offending post includes a call to action (such as “if you see her ask her why she scammed people!!”) or is otherwise tied to harassment, then it would constitute a violation under harassment.Sally is staying in Average Hotel!This puts Sally in danger, and is considered a physical location doxx.Sally lives on 123 Imagine Road, City.This puts Sally in danger, and is considered a physical location doxx.To report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a screenshot of the offender posting your physical location in a public forum.Update ProcessThe Rules of Engagement, and any other associated documents, must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following extraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a change log will be published for delegates."

Governance Fund Monitoring: Warden Swap,"Summary of Ongoing Concerns: Warden Swap and its Governance FundCredit:@nanobrofor initial insightsBackground:On June 17, 2022, theWarden Swap proposalwas submitted to the OP governance forum, requesting a Governance Fund of 300,000 OP to enhance the trading experience on Optimism and promote the Optimism ecosystem. The proposal wasapproved back in voting cycle 2.Proposed Fund Allocation:35% Marketing (105,000 OP):For targeted marketing campaigns, community events, and incentives for influencers to promote Wardenswap on Optimism.20% Trader Incentives (60,000 OP):For early adopters and active users to boost trading activity on Optimism.10% Referral Program (30,000 OP):For a program benefiting users who promote the use of WardenSwap on Optimism .25% Builder (75,000 OP):For grants or hackathons to aid developers integrating WardenSwap in the Optimism ecosystem.10% Development & Maintenance (30,000 OP):To cover associated costs of their Optimism related project.Controversies and Concerns:Marketing Initiatives:Post-approval, Warden Swap has demonstrated minimal marketing activity related to Optimism throughtout the 1 year period after they received the fund, notable only through two tweets:Synthetix integration on Optimism:LinkCommunity Distribution campaign:LinkTrader Distribution:Only 10,000 OP was distributed for their userswho use their platform from August 1, 2022, to February 16, 2023, despite the initial proposal of full distribution within a year.Transactions from this distribution can be found here:OP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet Etherscan.Theannouncementindicated a plan to extend the distribution timeline to four years, diverging from the initial one-year proposal made to the OP collective.Builder & Referral Programs:There have been no significant activities or developments in these areas, raising questions about the allocated funds for builders and referral incentives.Recent Developments:After a period of inactivity since Feb 2023, WardenSwap tweeted on May 2, 2024, aboutreorganizing with a new team and upcoming plans. On May 10, 2024, they proposed asnapshot voteto distribute OP tokens to traders and token holders, but without clear criteria. The team mentioned if approved there will be a “fair criteria for everyone, and the terms of the OP distribution will be announced in the next announcement.”Controversially, approximately 17 new wallet holders, who began accumulating WAD tokens (the governance token of WardenSwap) since February 2024 just prior to the comeback announcement, participated in the vote. This situation washighlightedby a vigilant community member who noted the unusual timing and activity, raising concerns within the community regarding the legitimacy of the voting process and potential insider influence, as these new participants appear to disproportionately affect the outcome of governance decisions.cc.@Gonna.eth@op_julian"
What is the Incentive to build on Optimism with the current grant system in place?,"Hi everyone,First off I’d just like to say that I’m a fan of the project as a whole and please do not read this in a negative tone. DAOs and governance in general is a tricky beast, and I am very impressed with how the system works thus far. Unfortunately it just doesn’t seem like this system of grants will suit a project like Tidus Wallet (the project I am a part of), and many projects for that matter going into the future.We all know what grants are supposed to be for, and the main three I am aware of under Optimism besides specific mission applications are: Builder’s Grant, Growth Experiments, and retroPGF.I’m just extremely perplexed by the whole process. We were under the impression that a builder’s grant is a grant to ‘build’.We(Tidus) say we’ll build XYZ(for Optimism), Grant is paid out once we do X then Y, then Z. The grant is used to build and only rewarded when something is built. Optimism grants are time-locked for an entire year. (perhaps I’m missing some details)BUT, if OP goes to .75 cents in a year we just built something for a year and our grant is now 1/4 of the size when we started, but my build obligation is the same. I don’t think anyone would mind if it was in small increments, but we are offering a larger upgrade.Okay. Well maybe apply for a different type of grant right? Well, we can’t apply for a ‘growth experiment’ grant because you can’t apply grant money to operations, only distribution to users. (found this out on first application attempt)Finally there is retroPGF, where you build something, or support something on OP, but hope to get granted some money as retro, not going to go into who deserves what etc… and all the politics of that, but that’s probably the only grant a project like ours could reasonably hope for.Really appreciate Optimism’s commitment to governance, and the crypto space in general, but I hope you guys can see how bad a decision this would be for a project like us on the other end of this process. I regret to have had to pull our grant application(really wanted to work on the OP stack). We can’t risk getting nothing a year after building. We’re just a bootstrapped wallet that has fought to build through the last cycle and we will have to look elsewhere for integration. Thanks again for all your help.-Bob"
Balancer & BeethovenX - Grantee accountability Thread,"Hello everyone, I am writing this post as a member of the BeethovenX DAO in regards to the Balancer & BeethovenX joint deployment on Optimism.Based on the current Discourse organization, we decided to create a fresh post that will reference the original grant and previous updates.Initial proposal:[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Balancer & BeethovenXGovernance Fund: Phase 1Project Name: BeethovenX, powered by Balancer 
Author Name: Solarcurve (BalancerDAO contributor, BeethovenX advisor) 
Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000 
L2 Recipient Address: 0x2a185C8A3C63d7bFe63aD5d950244FFe9d0a4b60 
Relevant Usage Metrics: Balancer has ~$1.4B TVL and does ~$500M volume per week. This is the network OP incentives would be competing in through the veBAL gauge vote. 
Currently on OP we have ~$4.8M TVL, ~$500k daily volume, ~$3-4k daily fees,  ~2k daily tx’s. 
Balancer & Bee…Update - Jan/23[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Balancer & BeethovenXGovernance Fund: Phase 1Hi@lavandeThanks for reaching out! I am responding to you as I do the financial reporting for Beethoven X. 
Our grant proposal allows us only to spend the grant money if we can match it with protocol fees. 
We wanted to give back to the Optimism ecosystem so we decided to see if we could take things a step further. We have achieved this by using our protocol fees to buy $OP tokens on the open market. This enabled us to do the matching on a token level. 
As of today, we have spent a net of 71k…After comprehensive evaluation, discussion, and research regarding the original grant from Seasons 2 and 3, the Beethoven X DAO believes it has optimized a viable and sustainable OP grant strategy that will help the Optimism Ecosystem scale sustainably. This incentive strategy is a long-term grant solution focused on incentive longevity that nourishes growth for the entire Optimism ecosystem without burning OP tokens for short-term returns.Rather than solely emitting OP tokens to Liquidity Pools, the Beethoven X DAO has taken steps towards developing a more symbiotic relationship with the OP ecosystem. For the initial grant application, the DAO proposed that OP tokens from the grant would only distribute to Liquidity Providers if matched with an equal share of protocol fees.To further solidify a symbiotic relationship with the Optimism ecosystem, the DAO optimized the grant to bolster OP sustainability further. All protocol fees previously paired with OP were instead utilized to buy an equal amount of $OP tokens from the open market to pair with the grant as issued. This strategy means that all grant spending on the protocol is matched 1:1 on an OP token level. To our knowledge, the Beethoven X DAO is the only protocol buying an equal share of OP matched with the grant instead of simply spending it.As of today, Beethoven X has spent a net of 97k $OP tokens, with 113k $OP bought back from the open market with protocol fees. This structure helped amass $60 million in TVL in April 2023, with TVL currently sitting around the $25m mark. The DAO is proud of how mutually beneficial and efficient this strategy has been in terms of $OP spent and will continue to move forward with new implementations and partners.Some partner protocols asked the Beethoven X DAO to distribute their $OP grant on their behalf; these are all included in the table’s inflow and outflow.Currently, the combined Balancer/BeethovenX deployment holds the highest amount of rETH liquidity on Optimism, and the DAOs partnership with the Oath Foundation has showcased the profound potential of Boosted Pools and Yield Bearing assets for growing interconnected ecosystem liquidity. Beethoven X is also the sole protocol that unlocks the benefits of the 8020 initiative and its optimized governance tokenomics for protocols on Optimism. Paraswap and Ethos Reserve are two protocols that have harnessed this technology so far, with over $2.3 million in TVL collectively.With veBALs cross-chain boost now live on Optimism, Aura Finance looks to further fuel liquidity growth withincentive market efficiencies. The DAO is eager to implement and combine the sustainable OP grant strategy with Aura to scale core pool dynamics, ve80/20, and help elevate the BeethovenX-Balancer joint deployment and, by extension, Optimism, to the next level.If you would like to verify any numbers discussed above, the Beethoven X DAO Treasury multisig is found here:OP Mainnet ExplorerGnosisSafeProxy | Address 0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60 | OP...The Contract Address 0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60 page allows users to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract address.

Analysis Report: Via Protocol Phase 1 Grant Proposal,"IntroductionIn response to the task provided, this report offers a comprehensive analysis of Via Protocol’s Phase 1 grant proposal. The recent transition in leadership, with the CEO taking charge of grant-related matters following the departure of the CTO, sets the backdrop for our examination. The report delves into critical aspects, including the allocation of the granted 100,000 OP tokens, an assessment of the team’s execution of the proposed activities, identification of any missing wallet addresses, and additional insights gleaned from our investigation.Additionally, we provide observations and analyses related to the implementation of the grant and offer recommendations to optimize the utilization of the grant for the sustained growth of Via Protocol and Optimism. This report aims to provide a clear understanding of the current state of affairs and offer actionable insights for the betterment of Via Protocol’s grant initiative.MethodologyThe analysis presented in this report is the culmination of a thorough investigation, drawing from a diverse range of sources. These sources include:Block Explorers and Smart Contracts:We extensively utilized block explorers to trace transactions and verify the allocation of the 100,000 OP tokens. Smart contract interactions were scrutinized to understand fund movements and allocation mechanisms.Via Protocol Website:The official website was consulted to cross-verify pertinent information regarding the grant proposal, team composition, and project milestones.Via Protocol GitHub Repositories:The repositories, specifically ‘via-sdk-js’ and ‘via-landing’, were examined for active development and contributions. This provided insights into the project’s technical progress.Via Protocol Social Media:Social media channels were monitored for official announcements, updates, and community interactions. This helped in gauging the level of engagement and transparency of the grant initiative.Dune Analytics for Smart Contract Analysis:Dune Analytics was leveraged for a detailed examination of smart contracts related to Via Protocol. This facilitated a granular understanding of contract interactions and fund movements.Galxe Campaigns:Information related to the Galxe campaigns, including participation numbers, was gathered from official sources. This provided context on community engagement efforts.CEO and CTO Social Media Presence:Social media profiles of the CEO and ex-CTO were scrutinized for any public statements, updates, or insights regarding Via Protocol. This provided additional context on project developments.Optimism Collective Forum:The forum was a crucial resource for accessing details about grant proposals, milestones, and the project’s interactions with the Optimism community.By collating data from these diverse sources, we aimed to ensure a comprehensive and multi-faceted analysis of Via Protocol’s Phase 1 grant proposal. This approach allowed us to cross-verify information and gain a holistic view of the project’s progress and activities.Where the granted 100K OP are sitting (This is the L2 recipient address: 0x1A27cdf069F2E8cc5b77b72BeA43851086aF5D83 and a related vault)The allocation of the granted 100,000 OP tokens has been meticulously tracked and examined. The tokens are currently secured in theVia Safe Multi-Sig Wallet at address 0xeC93157084dcE64F7E4c0F0EDF383114b5C805aA. This wallet employs a 2-threshold security measure, with two designated addresses assigned specific roles:L2 Recipient Address(0x1A27cdf069F2E8cc5b77b72BeA43851086aF5D83): This address serves as the primary recipient of the 100,000 OP tokens.Owner-2 Address(0x67E785af25156A1dcDB4920e0Cb72d22204F096A):Additionally, two other addresses are significant in this context:Airdrop Contract Creator(0xA256661Ca438e102Ec27ac49FA107308D7F992bF)Airdrop Contract(0x41bC6b41Fb617220263871B9F7c4ba35F9A45417)A chronological overview of key transactions involving the granted OP tokens is as follows:March 18, 2023:250,000 OP tokens weretransferredto the L2 recipient address.March 18, 2023:These 250,000 OP tokens weretransferredinto the Safe Multi-Sig Wallet.March 29, 2023:Atransaction of 150,000 OP tokens was initiated, directing them back to the Optimism Foundation.May 5, 2023:3310 OP tokens weretransferredto Owner-2.May 25, 2023:1000 OP tokens weretransferredto Airdrop Contract3310 OP tokens weretransferredto Airdrop Contract.As of the current assessment, the Via Safe Multi-Sig Wallet stands with a balance of 95,690 OP tokens. Concurrently, the Airdrop Contract 2584 OP tokens.1313×441 27.3 KB2. Has the team executed on what’s listed on the grant proposal and the outcome?The original proposal outlined a commitment to distribute 100% of incentives to users through two distinct initiatives:Here are the initial proposed milestones:30% (75,000 $OP) - Swap Gas refunds for trades on Via router, for as long as there is money.70% (175,000 $OP) - Long-term stimulation for users to bridge to Optimism. Will be only available for bridging to Optimism ETH, Stable Coins, or OP (should be discussed).These proposed milestones were subsequently updated, incorporating valuable insights from the community. The updated milestones provided in the comments section of the Optimism Collective Forum are:Milestone 1: Refund gas to 50,000 users or 75,000 of OP, whichever occurs first. Via will provide documentation to the Grants Council to make it easy to verify.Milestone 2: Distribute the remaining OP earmarked for gas refunds within 6 months of the initial OP grant funding in a manner it considers appropriate.Milestone 3: At least 25,000 new users or $30,000,000 bridges in volume. Max 50,000 users. Have a connection with at least 3 projects for this campaign.Via will provide documentation to the Grants Council to make it easy to verify.Milestone 4: On the completion of all other milestones, Via will submit a brief summary of results to the Grants Council. This should be completed no later than 6 months after receipt of OP tokens, even if some milestones are incomplete.To accomplish these milestones Galxe campaigns were run from April 4, 2023, to June 29, 2023. Here are the campaigns run on the platform:1282×622 37.2 KBThe Contract Address for this OP Grants Quests is0xF36Fb607E0B54F56acc5085357D2218Fc8DE4D1D1280×720 28.7 KB1280×720 29.7 KB1280×720 64.8 KBWhile it is unclear as to what the NFT owners would receive,the nft-drop-faq channel on Via Discord server mentions that the NFT owner will become a Via Chad and it may provide some additional advantages in the near future.Apart from this, we have delved deep into the contract address that Refunds the gas fee in OP for any swap or bridge on Via Exchange.

Add missing wallet addresses related to via protocol here and in the Notion TrackerThe Airdrop contract address, i.e. Distributor Address, will be pushed to the Github repo.4. Anything else you can uncover?In the course of our analysis, several additional observations have come to light, offering further context to Via Protocol’s current status:GitHub Repositories:Via Labs’ GitHub presence encompasses a total of 14 public repositories. Notably, the core repositories, ‘via-sdk-js’ and ‘via-landing’, have remained without active public commits over the past year. This suggests a potential slowdown in development activity in these specific areas.Team Dynamics Shift:The CTO who is also one of the founders has resigned from the team. However there is no official announcement regarding this except for in the Optimism Collective Forum. Consequently, the distribution of responsibilities within the team in light of this development remains undisclosed.Community Interaction:The protocol seems to be engaging with the community with their recent tweets about the OP Claim and benefits of NFT holders from the Galxe Campaign.These additional insights contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Via Protocol’s current landscape.Current Snapshot as on 17th Sept, 20231584×1600 279 KBFollowing the receipt of funding on March 18th, 2023, the grant initiative was set in motion on May 25th, 2023. The first transaction from the Airdrop contract also took place on the same day, marking the commencement of the grant’s distribution.As of September 17th, 2023, a total of approximately 1730 OP tokens have been claimed. The average daily claim rate stands at 24 OP tokens.At the current rate, the 100,000 OP token grant is anticipated to last forapproximately 4500 days.Even witha tenfold surge in the volume of bridges and swaps, the grant is projected to endure for anestimated 450 days.Observations & AnalysisThe user interface (UI) of the Via Protocol application is commendable and stands on par, if not ahead, of industry standards. Transactions are executed smoothly and with cost efficiency, contributing to an overall positive user experience.In order to thrive in a competitive market where similar services abound, a growth strategy is essential. Allocating a portion of the grant towards content creation and targeted marketing can draw in new users, establish brand trust, and sustain product integrity. Any reallocations of grant funds for purposes beyond the original intent should be transparently communicated to the grants council, prioritizing the potential for holistic network and product expansion.It is crucial to acknowledge that without substantial growth, the grant may remain underutilized. This underscores the necessity for an effective growth strategy to ensure its maximum impact."
NowNLater309 observation of C.O.C. violation,I have a issue that needs attention. I am surprised by the nature it entails and conclude it’s fairly new. I want attention brought to delegate statement by kuso.eth. The topic puts us in the negative spotlight and I’m sure it’s been overlooked. Please advise the delegate to amend the statement to align with our point of view. I feel these situations require attention. The impact of that topic puts negative light on the whole community. Thank you and stay Optimistic.
ParaSwap Appeal,"The paraswap team acknowledges that they are taking user funds wrongfully and even so they create barriers and refuse to refund users or give any appropriate information about it.image1156×266 84.1 KBIt is not common at all a team making a mistake like this and after taking user funds as hostage and demand users to make a governance vote to the DAO requesting a refund. ( not doable as it would require owning their token).What happened is that paraswap augustus swapper is taking users slippage set and taking that % as a fee that they collect to the DAO. The team also implies it was a “surplus”, the surplus refers to positive slippage in a swap, which is def. not the case here.In the following example they took a bit over 30% of the user swap to their fee collector (Arbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbiscan) .I don’t think its normal for a team at this stage and level to low tier-scam users out of their funds, specially after acknowledging the error is on their end. as i am writing this post has been over 5 days the team is reviewing my tx and muted/blocked me from contacting them, which leads me to believe this is a pure scam with intention.All users complaining in their community are left unanswered or in my case muted or blocked. It’s not okay for a team to steal user funds and puts all their effort in shuting down user, not fixing the problem. (the team even tried to fool users with fake explanations of what slippage and surplus are, which not coincide to their docs). They claim the surplus is the positive slippage but they are charging any amount of slippage user sets. (like the trade where they gobbled 30% of user funds on swap)Please take a deeper look and i am ready to provide a lot more information about this and evidences that support my appeal.How many users have been rolled by them and scammed by it without noticing really?"
NFTEarth RPGF Appeal,"There appears to have been a breakdown in the RPGF proposal review process that I believe needs some transparency so as to ensure we better understand what went wrong and how it can be avoided in the future.The proposal from NFTEarth was flagged with the following information in Review Round 2 and there was a unanimous vote from Badgeholder Reviewers to remove it:“This project is run by a serial scammer.The Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant Dispute #1: NFTEarth - Grants Discussions - ArbitrumFalse information about being the only team building indexers. Used copy written material from musician “3lua” without permission for NFT drop. See:L2DAO Investigation: Summary*”The NFTEarth Team was given an opportunity to appeal and provided the following:The report was filed under “False statements & deception, Deceiving badgeholders” I have been trolled/harassed while building on Optimism. The report starts by labeling me as a serial scammer. There is 0 substantiating evidence to support this other than just continual forum posts of this being the case - NFTEarth is live on Optimism right now - running athttps://nftearth.exchange. There were no false statements made or any deception of Badgeholders. Specifically what was cited was false information about being the only team building indexers. This is not was what was stated and appears they are just trying to cause confusion for badgeholders. Our team was and is still the only protocol to fork the Reservoir Indexer successfully, all other teams use their hosted version, which is a very different architecture. The other item cited was used copyrighted materials which again is baseless and not true, we made an actual cover song, no copyright infringement occurred.In short, substantial evidence wrongdoing by the NFTEarth Team was introduced including links to copious amounts of documentation however the vote to remove was seemingly overridden on appeal on no additional evidence other than a denial.Additionally, a simple search of the Arbitrum and Optimism forums yields a treasure trove of documentation detailing evidence of wrong doing by Weston and co:Original Dumping of OP grant, Deception of CollectiveGrant Abuse, Deception, Washing Trading, Sibyl AttackUsing Team Tokens to Dilute Supply, Drain LPsCreation and Rugging of NFT Collections, Sibyl AtttackUnauthorized Private Sale of Team TokensArbitrum Investigation and Grant Ban of NFTEPhysical Threats of Violence Against Arbitrum MembersEnd of NFTE to Launch New Anon NFT Exchange that Has Gone DarkVoting results are private, tagging the folks who volunteered as reviewers to weigh in here:@dmars300@ulerdogan@maaria.eth@joanbp@wmitsuda@Fuji@Gonna.eth@OPUserEd (?)@LauNaMuQuestions:Given one of the single most extensive collections of evidence of wrongdoing we’ve seen on a single applicant, what was the rationale for overturning on appeal?Was there any communication with Weston, the NFTEarth Team, or those who submitted the reports outside of what is outlined in the the appeal documents?Did@OPUserrecuse himself from voting in this process given his pastconnections to L2DAO?Do the reviewers still believe this proposal should be considered as legitimate by Badgeholders or should they do their best to minimize the likelihood of an allocation?Answers to these questions will help ensure that any immediate damage is mitigated and will help to understand what kind of safeguards can be put in place in the future."
Incentive Impact Analysis: Yearn,"Authors:@wyeeeh,@jamiehaSpecial thanks to support from:Blockchain@USC,@SatorProgram OverviewProtocol:YearnYearn Finance is a DeFi yield aggregation protocol, allowing individuals, DAOs and other protocols to deposit digital assets and receive yield. The core product,yVault, are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market, each driven by one or more Strategies.Governance Fund Season/Cycle:Grant Season 2, Phase 1, Cycle 7Incentive Program Period: May 18, 2023 - February 22, 2024Distribution Plan for the OP Incentives: 25,000 OP tokens per week * 40 weeksWallet Funded:0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7KPIs for Incentive ProgramEnable 10 new partners on Optimism, including: Alchemix, QiDao, Swype, Rhino, Omni, Spool, Revest, Abra, DeFi Saver, TapiocaGrow Optimism to Yearn’s second highest TVL by chainKey TakeawaysThe Optimism Foundation allocated 1 million OP tokens to Yearn Finance Protocol, which Yearn will distribute 100% of grant $OP tokens to yVault depositors to incentivize the move to Optimism.25,000 OP tokens will be distributed weekly over the course of 40 weeks, starting on May 18th, 2023.Yearn successfully fulfills the second KPI outlined in the proposal by growing Optimism to Yearn’s second highest TVL by chain, within the span of just one month, highlighting a substantial positive impact of the OP incentive program on Yearn’s user engagement and presence on Optimism network.The incentive program successfully drew in new liquidity providers and encouraged active participation from existing users, with its TVL on Optimism surged from under $300K to over $14M, contributing to 2.3% of total TVL on Optimism in November. Optimism now became the second largest chain considering Yearn’s TVL by chain.After the launch of the incentive program we observed that there is a clear increase in both deposit activities, as the deposit transactions grew from nearly 50 to over 3K per week. yvUSDT and yvUSDC now have the largest user deposits of 1.5M yvUSDT and 1.2M yvUSDC respectively.As of November 19, 2023, Yearn distributed a total of 534,758 yvOP tokens as rewards, with 86% claimed by users already.Although Yearn has allocated a substantial portion of yvOP rewards to one of the vaults named “yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f,” user claim rate for these yvOP rewards is relatively low at 36%.OP Incentive DistributionThis part analyzed how the 1,000,000 OP tokens allocated to Yearn were used by tracking the transfer history of Yearn’s recipient wallet for OP grants (0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7).On November 24, 2022, Yearn received the allocated 1,000,000 OP tokens from OP Foundations to launch its incentive program.1600×130 49.4 KBThen the 1 million OP tokens were deposited into yvOP vaults with four distinct transactions of 50K, 250K, 250K, and 450K OP tokens. These OP tokens are deposited to get yvOP tokens as actual incentives that will be added to Yearn vaults.1600×356 113 KBThen, we tracked the total yvOP tokens deposited into and distributed to OP boosted Yearn vaults from the funded wallet by week, following the distribution plan Yearn proposed (25K OP tokens * 40 weeks).As the chart below shows, the blue bar denotes instances where Yearn deposited 1 million OP tokens into the yvOP. Due to the transaction fees, about 993,699 yvOP tokens were generated in total. The orange bars represent the yvOP token incentives added to OP boosted Yearn vaults each week.1354×806 78.8 KBThe area chart below shows the remaining yvOP in the funded wallet awaiting for distribution. In general, the distribution process is continuous and steady.1600×879 65.6 KBAs of November 19, 2023, Yearn deployed a total of 534,758 yvOP tokens as rewards in the past 27 weeks, among which 460,863 yvOP tokens are already claimed by users. There are still 459K yvOP tokens awaiting for distribution in the following 23 weeks.1600×194 74.6 KBOP Incentives Breakdown by yVaultsYearn’s core product is yVault, which refers to capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market, each driven by one or more strategies.The OP token incentives, as detailed in the Yearn’s proposal, will be used to reward users deposited their assets in yVaults on Optimism.Given this, we parsed Yearn vault’s contract address on Optimism fromYearn’s data API, and labeled OP boosted vaults based on whether the vault rewarding contracts received OP tokens from Yearn’s funded wallet.Overall, there are 92 Yearn vaults (test contract excluded) created on Optimism, while 41 vaults, nearly a half, have been set with OP incentives.|624.0000000000001x1911600×488 59.4 KBAfter tracking the yvOP tokens transferred from the funded wallet to other staking contracts, we identified all the rewards distribution contracts for each Yearn vaults.The transfer highlighted in blue below demonstrates two examples of refilling yvOP tokens into rewarding contract of yvUSDT vault (0xf66932f225ca48856b7f97b6f060f4c0d244af8e).1600×479 166 KBLooking into the yvOP token transfer history, the last transaction highlighted in blue is the first fillment of yvOP incentives into yvUSDT vaults. Then the three transactions highlighted in orange are examples where users claimed yvOP rewards from their deposit in the yvUSDT vault.1600×237 104 KBBased on the methodology detailed below, we then calculated the allocation of yvOPs across various OP boosted vaults. It is observed from the data that there is no apparent preferential treatment among the different vaults, indicating a relatively equitable distribution of yvOPs across all vaults (Mean = 11,162; Median = 9,650).1354×802 195 KB1348×796 156 KBBut we also observed an ineffective incentive in the yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f vault specifically. It was allocated the most 37,500 yvOP tokens as incentives, but only 36% were claimed by users. Compared to the claim rate over 90% of other vaults like yvUSDT, yvUSDC, etc, the efficiency of yvOP incentive for yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f appears to be relatively low. For future research, one should look into the possible reason for this irregularity.1600×511 131 KBOP Incentive ImpactTVLThe Total Value Locked (TVL) for Yearn Finance exhibited robust growth following its launch in July 2021, reaching a peak of nearly $7 billion in 2022. Starting around July 2022, the TVL remained relatively low, signaling a limited influx of capital into the protocol.In October 2022, Yearn Finance launched vaults on Optimism network, where the TVL stabilized at approximately $300K. During this period, Ethereum and Fantom emerged as the predominant chains for Yearn with the highest TVL of nearly $442 million and $16 million respectively.1600×487 65.9 KB1600×477 82.6 KBFollowing the initiation of the OP incentive program on May 18th, the TVL of Yearn on Optimism surged, which indicated heightened interest and active engagement with Optimism within Yearn. As demonstrated in the charts, Yearn’s TVL on Optimism reached nearly $14.17 million just after one month since the launch of the incentive program, surpassing Fantom and establishing itself as the second-highest TVL chain on Yearn. This reflects the fulfillment of the second Key Performance Indicator (KPI) outlined in Yearn’s proposal within the span of just one month, highlighting a substantial positive impact of the OP incentive program on Yearn’s user engagement and presence on Optimism network.1600×497 92.8 KBThrough an analysis of Yearn’s overall TVL composition on Optimism, we observed that Yearn’s contribution to Optimism’s TVL has increased from 0.03% before the incentive program to 3% after the incentive program in August, stabilizing at 2.3% in November.1600×1015 69.6 KB1600×1023 73 KBSource:DefilamaBy August, TVL of Yearn on Optimism chain reached its highest peak at approximately $30 million, indicating the effectiveness of the incentive program. The incentive program successfully drew in new liquidity providers and encouraged active participation from existing users, resulting in a substantial boost of TVL.User ActivitiesAfter the launch of the incentive program on May 18, 2023, a substantial increase in user transactions was observed across both OP boosted vaults and non-OP boosted vaults. We also observed an unusual peak in the user transactions with OP boosted vaults in April 2023. Although we are not able to perform a comprehensive exploration of the specifics of these transactions due to the time constraints, one plausible explanation for this surge could be attributed to the deployment of yvOP rewards for vaults and test transactions with these OP boosted vaults.1600×709 71.1 KBWhen delved into the breakdown of user transactions specifically within OP boosted vaults, an interesting pattern was found in user deposit and withdrawal. After May, there is a clear increase in deposit transactions compared to withdrawals from OP boosted vaults.1600×692 75.3 KBUser Deposits and WithdrawalsBased on the user transactions with vaults, we conducted an analysis of token amounts deposited and withdrawn from each vault over time, as visually represented in the chart below.Overall, users deposited more than they withdrew from the vault. Most of the deposits happened before July 2023, while the trading token amounts saw a decrease after August.1600×691 64.2 KBIf broken down by vaults, we can find that yvUSDT and yvUSDC are the hottest tokens with the largest trading amount historically.1600×700 120 KBAs of November 19, 2023, yvUSDC, yvDAI, yvUSDT and yvMAI are the OP boosted vaults with the highest user deposits.1600×675 133 KB*It is worth noting that currently we haven’t included token value for LP tokens nor calculated trading volume in USD or ETH, so there’s still limitations when comparing user deposits in different vaultsRecommendationsEnhance communication and awareness. Despite the success in drawing in new liquidity providers, the relatively low user claim rate, demonstrated in theyvVelo-alETH-WETH-fvault, indicates a potential gap in user awareness. Implementing targeted communication, providing clearer instructions, and enhancing resources could help bridge this gap and improve user participation.Closing RemarksThe incentive of Yearn plans to last for 40 weeks starting from May 18, 2023. During the past 27 weeks, Yearn has deployed over half of the overall OP grants (534,758 yvOP tokens) as rewards for OP boosted vaults, among which 86% (460,863 yvOP tokens) were already claimed by users.The KPI set by Yearn in its proposal to make Optimism the second largest chain of Yearn by TVL was realized in one month after the incentive program. The significant increase in Yearn TVL on Optimism by chain as well as its contribution to Optimism’s TVL both showed the effectiveness of the OP incentive program.ResourcesYearn Incentive Analysis Dashboardby @wyeeehOP Analytics RepoIncentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc@optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive(OP Mainnet)DefiLlamaOptimism TVL (Included liquidity staking TVL & double count in TVL calculation)Yearn TVL across chainsYearnYearn WatchAPI"

Since its delegation in November 2022, the TVL has experienced volatility but remains slightly above its initial value. Although TVL is a general metric that can be applied across multiple different protocols, it is especially important to consider for Velodrome, as high liquidity is one of their goals in being a successful DEX for Optimism.Metrics for Locking IncentivesVelo and veVELO Supply:1600×635 68.1 KBSource:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-teamThe circulating supply of $VELO and the total supply of $veVELO are steadily increasing. The initial veVELO supply spike is explained by the update from V1 to V2 as data was transferred. Theoretically, as the veVELO supply increases, the VELO supply should correspondingly decrease. However, the VELO supply is increasing more than veVELO because the increasing number of VELOs is proportional to the emissions reward levels that Velodrome awards LPs with. The circulating VELO supply is beginning to diverge from the VeVELO supply.New Pools Created:1600×628 45.9 KBSource:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-teamThe number of new pairs created (pools) since the OP grant exhibited its highest levels around February of 2023. The number of new pairs has recently reverted to the value during the beginning of the delegation. The number of pairs created is indicative of an increasing number of new token pools employed on Velodrome. This is an implicit measure of bribing as well, as the number of bribes is proportional to the number of new pools created.Metrics for BribingVelodrome Bribes per Day:1600×795 57.6 KBSource:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-teamVelodrome has exhibited a consistent number of daily bribes since its delegation disregarding the outliers in August 2022, September 2022, and June 2023. Before November 2022, a few spikes indicated a significant increase in activity. After the OP delegation, we saw more consistent users, instead of a high rate of users during certain periods.Fees and Bribe Rewards:1600×633 102 KBSource:https://dune.com/0xkhmer/bribes-warThe absolute value of bribes has exhibited volatility since the OP delegation, peaking in between the 56-64 epoch. Although volatile, Bribes are at significantly higher levels since the OP delegation.1324×441 39.5 KBSource:Change in Pools’ Bribes on Velodrome from 6/2022 - 11/2023 (dune.com)Last August, there was an increase in pools bribed. Aside from a spike in June 2023, and a few instances of increased pool activity in December 2022, February 2023, and September 2023, it seems that a lot of pools are losing their bribes and that perhaps activity has decreased from the protocol end of utilizing velodrome.Metrics for LiquidityTransaction Number:1600×519 59.5 KBSource:https://dune.com/queries/3181585/5313302The graph depicts the number of transactions over time for Velodrome, starting from June 2022 to November 2023. There are notable spikes in transaction volume, with the highest peaks occurring around August 2022. After these peaks, the transaction volume shows some volatility but tends to decrease overall, with occasional smaller spikes. There’s a pattern of fluctuating activity with no other peaks reaching the same height as those in August 2022. The overall trend suggests periods of high activity followed by stabilization, with the highest number of transactions concentrated in the earlier months, particularly August 2022.Slippage Rate:1600×460 42.6 KBSource:https://dune.com/queries/3181602/5313347The graph shows the slippage rate for Velodrome from early June 2022 to late November 2023. The slippage rate is generally low, hovering close to zero, but several extreme spikes exceed 300 at certain points. The most notable spike occurs around late August 2022, with another significant peak around late January 2023. After these spikes, the slippage rate returns to lower levels, with some minor fluctuations over time. The extreme values suggest instances of high volatility or possible anomalies in transaction processing or liquidity within the Velodrome platform during those times.User MetricsDaily Active WalletsSource:Token Terminal | Fundamentals for crypto1600×864 115 KBThis chart displays the active daily wallets on Velodrome. Although the numbers remain consistent, there have been several recent spikes in user count. It is important to note that wallets and users are not always 1:1. A user can have multiple wallets, as well as bots.Daily Trading Volume:Token Terminal | Fundamentals for crypto1600×834 132 KBInterestingly, the daily trading volume is slightly inverted compared to daily active wallets. The highest levels exhibited from March to April of 2023. Although there was a slight drop-off after these dates, the numbers have remained relatively consistent. It is also important to note that the daily trading volume overall increased exponentially since the OP delegation.AnalysisLocking IncentivesThe KPIs were successfully met for the incentivization of locking VELO. According to the supply of VELO and veVELO graph, 70% of VELO’s supply has remained locked, with consistent levels hovering around 75% of the supply locked. Additionally, a large number of new protocols have been added to the ecosystem which is displayed by the new pairs count graph. There has been a consistent number of new pools created since the delegation. Velodrome was successful in its own terms delegating its OP to increase locking incentives.BribingSimply put, on average, bribes and fees have increased and average bribes on a per day basis have increased, albeit marginally, since the OP drop on November 25th. The total change in pools bribed has increased, from the pre-drop average of -6.25 bribes per month, to -2 bribes per month, thus the OP drop has been effective on that front.It could mean that the OP’s utilization through the bribe matching incentive is working. Thus the need for so many bribes becomes inefficient, because the pools that protocols were using were sufficiently liquid, or the other pathways for distribution may have been affected by the switch.Regardless, immediately after the OP delegation, we see an increase in consistent users, and then after the shift, we see a slight dip. So at least for a while, it seems that bribe matching was more efficient and there was a good amount of demand and utilization over a 8-month period.LiquidityThe provided histogram for transaction volume on Velodrome from June 2022 to November 2023 can be analyzed to understand the impact of the “Building Deep Liquidity” initiative. To assess the high number of transactions, a key performance indicator (KPI) for the initiative, we look for peaks in the graph that represent increased activity. These peaks would be indicative of successful incentivization if they align with the timing of the OP distributions to support key public good pools.Upon examination, several spikes in transaction volume are apparent, which may correspond with periods following the distribution of incentives. These are the taller bars in the histogram, suggesting a temporary surge in transactions. However, to truly meet the KPI, these spikes would need to demonstrate sustainability, meaning the high volume is not just a short-term reaction but is maintained over time. The general downtrend in transaction volumes towards the end of the period suggests that the incentivization impact may wane, requiring continuous efforts to sustain engagement.Comparing these peaks with the troughs—periods of lower transaction volumes—provides additional insight. The troughs could reflect the natural fluctuation in trading activity or periods with reduced or absent incentives. A baseline transaction volume should be established, which can be done by assessing the level of activity before the incentive program began. This would help in understanding the true elevation in activity due to the initiative.Finally, while the histogram focuses on transaction counts, a comprehensive analysis should also consider external factors that can affect trading volumes, such as overall market conditions and other economic events, which could lead to an increase or decrease in transactions independent of the incentives provided.Slippage RateThe histogram displaying Velodrome’s slippage rate from June 2022 to November 2023 provides insights pertinent to the platform’s KPI of maintaining low slippage rates, especially for high-volume trades. The goal of this KPI, alongside the “Building Deep Liquidity” initiative which allocated 1 million OP to bolster key public good pools, is to ensure that large transactions can be executed without significantly affecting the market price.A cursory analysis reveals that most of the data points are clustered close to the baseline, indicating that Velodrome typically maintains a low slippage rate. This is an affirmative sign of a liquid market where users can expect their trades to be executed at prices close to their expectations. Such a condition is favorable for traders and is indicative of a healthy trading environment that the initiative aims to foster.However, the graph also shows several pronounced spikes where the slippage rate exceeds the general low baseline by a substantial margin. These peaks are critical to analyze, as they represent instances where traders experienced higher-than-expected slippage. The reasons behind these peaks could range from market-wide volatility, substantial trades that momentarily outstrip the available liquidity or periodic events that induce larger-than-usual trading volumes.The frequency and timing of these spikes could yield deeper insights. If the spikes align with known high-volume trading periods or follow incentive distributions, this might suggest that while the initiative is successful in attracting volume, it may simultaneously strain the liquidity pools, resulting in higher slippage. Conversely, if the spikes do not correspond with such periods, they may be attributable to external market factors or isolated large transactions that are less reflective of the overall market condition.To address these spikes and enhance the platform’s resilience against high slippage incidents, it would be crucial for Velodrome to analyze the specific conditions under which these peaks occur. By understanding these conditions, Velodrome could implement strategies to further deepen liquidity or introduce mechanisms to better absorb large trades, thereby aligning with the KPI of ensuring low slippage even during high volume trade periods.RecommendationsProviding additional OP for locking VELO proved to be successful, as there was a steady amount of users locking their VELO. However, we are beginning to see a slight divergence in the supply of VELO and veVELO. Examining the journey of this divergence should allow for additional insight into this incentive program.For a more comprehensive analysis of liquidity, additional data linking the OP distribution events to transaction volumes would be needed, especially to assess if these peaks align with the distribution of incentives and to evaluate the sustainability of the transaction volumes as a key performance indicator for the initiative’s success.Looking holistically at all of the graphs regarding both user metrics and KPI analysis, there seems to be a consistent spike in metrics whether it be the number of transactions, daily active wallets, or number of bribes in the spring months of 2023. Examining this cause could provide insight into how to increase incentivization among users.Source:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-incentive"
OP grants through Season 2: where has the OP gone?,"As promised, this will be a continuously updated thread loosely tracking where the granted OP has gone. My goal is to cover all of the grants, tracking how OP flowed to likely user or team wallets, and to what ends. Among other things I’ll be paying attention to distribution (e.g., how many OP paid out per user connected, share of top 5 wallets, etc) and to whether the OP was used for intended ends.This is a really time-consuming thing that requires some double-checking, and even then I might get things wrong. So I invite people to join me on this, especially the project teams that will be referenced. I’ll generally try to do outreach to those teams privately to get more clarity before posting publicly, though."

OPDelegate.com Update (Season 4 Grant),"Hey Everyone!This post is long overdue and I apologize for that. I am making this post to update everyone on the status of the OPDelegate website which received a grant in Season 4.Hereis a recent demo of how the website is looking. We also have a lot more work finished on backend data streams/compute. I’m happy to share that code with anybody interested (dm me) but it would need to be hardened for security before publishing to the public.We had an issue where a backend developer decided to leave the project. I made the dumb decision to take on that role myself, which led to the delays due to my time being taken by other responsibilities.That said, work is continuing in earnest and I am incredibly excited to make this a tool that becomes a home-base for delegates in the OP Collective!

Incentive Impact Analysis: Stargate,"OP Grant Analysis - Stargate FinanceNote: Additional links/images can be found in Gitbook link belowOP Mainnet is a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain powered by Optimism. It has become a key infrastructure player, significantly enhancing scalability and user experience. As part of its growth strategy, OP Mainnet has distributed OP tokens via grants to select protocols, with Stargate Finance being one of the top recipients. The aim of this report is to perform a detailed analysis of Stargate Finance’s utilization of these granted OP tokens. We’ll investigate how these tokens and any co-rewards have been deployed to incentivize usage and liquidity on OP Mainnet. This includes an examination of key performance indicators, wallet behavior, and user retention in scenarios with and without incentives.Dune Dashboard:Dune LinkReport:Gitbook LinkStargate FinanceWhat is Stargate Finance?According to Stargate’s website, “Stargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol that lives at the heart of Omnichain DeFi.” Great, but let’s translate that into plain English for those who aren’t immersed in crypto 24/7. Simply put, Stargate serves as a bridge protocol, enabling users to move cryptocurrency tokens between distinct blockchains (for instance, transferring ETH from Optimism to Polygon). These bridges are foundational elements crucial for the expansion of Layer 2 networks like Optimism. They simplify the onboarding process for new users, offering a more straightforward path to get involved in L2 ecosystems.How were the OP Grant Funds Distributed?From the 1,000,000 OP tokens granted to Stargate, 700,000 were earmarked for a Liquidity Mining Program. Thesis: Deeper liquidity ensures users can enjoy reduced slippage as they are bridging between networks.On August, 1st 2022 Stargate paused their existing liquidity mining reward system (STG) and on August, 5th 2022 initiated OP rewards for liquidity mining.The remaining 300,000 tokens were reserved for Qualified Partners who help integrate Stargate into their project.As of October, 1st 2023, Stargate still has 368,999 OP tokens within their Multisig safe (0x392AC17A9028515a3bFA6CCe51F8b70306C6bd43)AnalysisLiquidity Mining OP RewardsLet’s evaluate how the activation of OP liquidity mining rewards starting on August, 5th 2023 impacted Stargate bridge activity. The total bridge volume on OP Mainnet experienced a significant increase, rising from $16 million to $36 million between July and August, representing a growth rate of 125%. The Volume sustained this range into September and October before resuming an upwards trajectory. We see a similar trend for bridge volumetoOP Mainnet. OP Liquidity mining rewards are still ongoing as of October, 2023.

It’s still too early to evaluate the impact of this integration but Beefy Finance estimates it will drive 40m in volume over the next 12 months.On Apr 28, 2023 Stargate DAO voted to approve 45,000 OP tokens to be allocated to Galxe quests.However, as of October, 1st 2023 no quests have been activated and the 45,000 OP tokens are still dormant within a presumed Galxe owned wallet.Tx hash: [0xb340ec0a7c46601eea884d538f44d95403c73e1e5d7ff41cd01bcc0a77845ab6]Galxe wallet: [0x5ab0fdc6f0ca9ea178c95ceccf944a4ce1aedddd]ConclusionOverall, it might be premature to discern the impact of OP incentives on both Stargate and OP Mainnet. The Stargate multisig wallet still holds a significant balance of 368,999 OP tokens to distribute, and many of the deployed rewards haven’t fully matured yet. While we did observe a spike in OP Mainnet bridge volume coinciding with the activation of OP rewards, it’s worth noting that other incentives—specifically, STG rewards—were already in play and swapped out for OP rewards. A comparative analysis between a rewardless liquidity mining program and an OP rewards program could shed more light on its true impact."

L2DAO Investigation: Summary,"To keep things neat I’ve moved my own research into its own thread. Details below:I’ve identifiedwhat I think is the origin of the second transferof 27,500 OP to a multisig governed by L2DAO’s principals, who then market dump that OP for USDC.This snapshot completes strong onchain and firsthand evidence that:NFTEarth and this second multisig, called LFGROW, share leadership teams with L2DAO and can be said to be indistinguishable from it as far as management is concernedLayer2DAO principals govern the multisigs dumping OP for USDC and proceeding with other onchain activities apparently inconsistent with the grant’s intention and violating the no-sale rule (regardless of whether it was in force when this grant was made)I am going to selectively quote the linked proposal authorizing this transfer here, emphases mine:This is a proposal to the Layer2DAO community tocreate a new DAO focused exclusively on educational and tooling solutions for L2 NFT creators, artists and owners.In addition to education; the new DAO would havea clear focus on connecting the new knowledge gained by creators/artists/owners to easily accessible infrastructureleading to pragmatic results and the proliferation of NFT development on Layer2 Ethereum. This initiative is torevive and support active NFTs creation (and thus trading)on L2 chains, which have a lot of benefits “by design” vs. Mainnet. NFTEarth is focusing on trading, however, without active creators/projects, there will be no trading; 2. If you are not having huge funding (to be able to develop everything on your own), as a creator/project, you need to use certain tools to create and promote your collections. Unfortunately, most of the tools available in the market as well information are not “tailored” to L2 and are scattered around.Most needed tools are – NFT Generator, Allow/WL list/raffles tool, Launchpad and specific in this case: tool to migrate NFTs from L1 → L2.So this is supposed to be a separate DAO that receives this grant. However,this purportedly separate DAO comprises the exact same signers as NFTEarth and, like NFTEarth, cannot be credibly determined to be an arm’s-length ecosystem project, as the multisig is controllable by Layer2DAO signers.Trainclaims in his responsethe following:Layer2DAO response to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]NFT Earth, while having some of the same team members (notably Weston), was and is a separate organization that was voted on by the OPIncubator NFT holders and approved as a grant recipient. This was not and is not the same organization that received the Phase 0 grant (Layer2DAO). Exosphere and I were asked if we wanted to join as advisors, which we accepted.Train’s claim downplaying their role is misleading and demonstrably untrue. The shapshot’s author, 0xadventurer (whose identity could be an alt of a known principal given the relative lack of historic activity in L2DAO), says so themselves:funds will be sent to multi-sig controlled by current L2DAO leaders, for them to oversee fund distribution.This proves by the author’s admission thatNFTEarth, whose multisig is identical to the one described here, is in fact run by Layer2Dao’s principals. This is proof that the Layer2DAO team market sold granted OP on two separate occasions.A follow-up post will describe in greater detail what this wallet has in fact been doing. Suffice it to say it calls into question the stated intentions of the grant.As a reminder, Layer2DAO’soriginal proposalstates:Layer2DAO’s stated mission as a DAO is to expand the Ethereum L2 ecosystem and invest in L2 ecosystem projects. As such the DAO aims to use part of its Optimism Fund grant to incentivize high-impact Optimism protocols.Layer2DAO is proposing to use 240,000 OP tokens to create the OPIncubator project that will incentivise projects that run on Optimism.I think anyone would take this to suggest that this grant is intended to incentivizeoutsideprojects in the ecosystem. If L2DAO had spun up 6 entities with the same two principals and gave them OP to be market dumped, I think that would be correctly understood to be against the spirit of the application or the Grant program as a whole.What we have here is just this, for at least 2 subgrants (research ongoing).Finally, I’m not going to address Train’s claims about me, but I do want to make an illustrative point here. Train quotes me to claim that I am being inconsistent in my application of Grant guidelines:Layer2DAO response to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]Jack’s own words in response to a OPIncubator recipient was:“My understanding (and it could be flawed here) is that Decentragora has every right to do whatever it wants with the given OP – their reception in my mind is indistinguishable from someone receiving liquidity mining rewards”.This is a crucial point I want to make. Decentragora is aseparate organizationthat, after interviewing its principals, I judged to becompletely at arm’s length from L2DAO. They do not pose the same risk of self-dealing that I am observing in L2DAO’s self-granting two ecosystem grants, one for NFTEarth and one ostensibly for this other DAO described above. Surely anybody can tell the difference here.But don’t worry, of course, the Layer 2 Dao team assures you that the funds are in good hands:Moreover – here is my promise that I personally will not “take” any penny from this initial LTIP-7 funding. I’m not doing this for short term benefit, I’m doing this for L2 and way too bigger aims/goals! With this new initiative, we would like to support NFTEarth focus on the Layer2 NFTs market development as well as grow the L2 NFT ecosystem in general!Future disclosure will discuss what in fact has occurred on these multisigs.Original postI can distill some of this info@Dicasopresents into what I think is the key fact here:There aretwo multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market dump OP. If you grant that one of these is ostensibly NFTEarth’s official multisig receiving an L2DAO grant, I can’t find public justification for the second.Regardless of what these addresses then did (among other things, sell OP for USDC), the ownership of these multisigs is what to focus on.Layer 2 Dao’s multisig isSafe – Settings – Setup– addresses are:0xD131F1BcDd547e067Af447dD3C36C99d6be9FdEB - westonnelson.eth0xE7a2d53dA40Ba37495d4Cf84811a59AAcE2f04A5 - wallet connected to exospherel2.eth0x1CabC3e62e0527cBe09917F5Ca8e6D9999502d820x357990585a6BB953DCBA126de48585ed27E22319 - wallet connected to exospherel2.ethThe first multisig, 0x56d, which we’ll say is the main NFTEarth multisig,gets 27,500 OP from 0xaf5on Jan 10.

But because this is a 2/5 multisig, L2DAO principals can be said to control this wallet.Interestingly,an owner is removed and replacedon Feb 3. The previous owning address had been0xeafcb5b9f0be74296d89182c9915117e59882f2aand was evidently sunset on Optimism. It was replaced by0x119a849400dd8b61c8ab8995cb37af32dbbd2d8b, an active L2DAO owner called 0xadventurer.eth.This may be relevant because the previous day, the 2/4 L2DAO multisig performs asecondtransfer of 27,500 OPto adifferent2/5 multisig. The reasoning behind this transfer is unaccounted for and is suspicious because this multisig has theexact same signers as the first- i.e., it comprises Layer2DAO principals and is functionally controlled by L2DAO signers. This address also methodically dumps all of the sent OP.So there aretwo multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market dump OP, and one of these transfers I can’t find public justification for.I think future research should uncover the actions and linkages involving these multisigs and their signers, and I call on@0xWestonor@Exosphereto explain why there are two identical multisigs, both with L2DAO signers, that receive and sell large amounts of OP.This of course in addition to assembling further information on what ultimately gets done with the funds once they are swapped to USDC."
OP Reward Impact Analysis: Perpetual Protocol(Phase 0),"Program InformationPerpetual ProtocolProposalPhase 0 Cycle 1 - 9,000,000 OP - May 3, 2022Optimism Voting Cycle #1 Phase 0June 9, 2022Vote Snapshot 1(June 10-23, 2022)The votes for passing proposals in the early stage were batched for one time covering all the backlog of proposals on Snapshot.Initial transferfrom OP Foundation to Perp L2 Recipient Address July 8, 2022Key TakeawaysGeneral observations across projects.Builder grants proposed by most projects have been highly ignored, whereas, without the growth of mutual benefits, there is no ecosystem which can help one grow.Large pie of the distribution ends up in very addresses, raising a concern on benefitting whales/insider/misappropriation. This can be addressed by transparent reporting by the grantees.Project Specific Observations.The Optimism grant has definitely unlocked the growth of Perpetual Protocol, adding a member to the ecosystem where the benefits can be shared later if not now.The Perpetual team has kept the flow of rewards and transactions clean compared to other grantees. Being one of the largest recipients of the grant, the team stands ready for the tailwind.DistributionTwitter AnnouncementAs originally proposed, distribution was to be carried out in three broad heads with Liquidity Mining using 8M OP and builder Acquisition using the remaining 1M OP.The following distribution is as we see it and the numbers are as it happened.Liquidity Acquisition:are incentive for lenders to lend any type of collateral to the Market Making Entity (1.8mn)2**. Liquidity Mining:** are incentive for market makers to ensure deep liquidity and the best experience for traders (5.7mn)Builder Acquisition:we will extend our current grants program and further incentivise builders to build on top of Perp and utilize Perp as a base layer (0.5mn)Note:-Retroactive is considered here as Long-term Liquidity Acquisition, incentivizing users to provide liquidity for similar surprises in the future. Pool Party Rewards are considered as Liquidity Mining1220×782 60.6 KBTotal Value LockedPerpetual has three products Trade, Vault & Stake. USDC is the main asset in the TVL as the Stake product attracts this liquidity. For trading Perpetual uses Uniswap V3’s liquidity pools, hence a large TVL on their side is not the only way to grow.1600×779 71.3 KBDaily Transactions1600×898 169 KBSource:-Daily TransactionsThe daily transaction activity for using Perpetual products exhibited notable spikes, with the highest surges occurring in November 2022 and subsequently in January 2023. These peaks in daily transactions reflect heightened user engagement and activity within the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem during these periods.Daily Transacting Addresses1600×894 149 KBSource:-Daily Transacting AddressesDuring the observed period from 22-09-2023 to 17-01-2023, there was a notable uptrend in daily transacting addresses within the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem. A significant peak in daily transacting addresses was recorded on 07-01-2023, reaching its highest point at approximately 13.25K, indicating heightened user engagement during that period.Prior to the initiation of the pool party reward program, the average daily transacting addresses stood at 228. However, after the introduction of this program, there was a substantial increase, with an average of 1082 daily transacting addresses, indicating a significant boost in user activity and engagement.Daily Network Fees Generated1600×900 55.7 KBSource:-Daily Network Fees GeneratedPrior to June 2023, the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem generated relatively modest daily network fees, consistently remaining below 1 ETH. However, a significant shift occurred in June 2023, marking a substantial increase in daily network fees, surpassing 1 ETH on a regular basis. This upward trajectory reached its zenith in August 2023, when daily network fees peaked at approximately 9.7 ETH.Reward Claimer Analysis1600×940 151 KBRetroactive OP Airdrop🪂This was one of the mostcontroversialdistributions as it was not mentioned in the proposal. The Perpetual Team had theirreasonsas explained in the forum. Following in an excerpt from themirror post,“Out of the 8 million OP tokens allocated to our LPs, 1.8 million will be airdropped across all689 historical LPswho have facilitated volume on our DEX since the launch of Perp v2 Curie. A total of 100,000 OP is to be allocated to each market.”The top 5 users were allocated 52.9% of the total OP Airdrop, while the collective share for the top 25 users amounted to 87.5%. These statistics are presented as factual information since the questions posed are challenging to address, I would leave these for the community to judge.1434×796 44.9 KBSource:-DunePool Party​:droplet:The following lines are from the mirror post of Perpetual,“6.58 million of the OP tokens dedicated to LPs will be distributed as incentives through our Pool Party initiative.”These were made available byPool Party Rewardscontract were liquidity providers can claim their weekly rewards across the marketWeekly Claims are enabled.1480×806 48.5 KBGrantsThe team had dedicated 500k OP by swapping to $367k USDC, transferring it to Ethereum and later getting it back on OP Mainnet. Currently, $178k USDC sits at thisGrants Safe Wallet& rest have been distributed across 19 different transactions with the highest being 40k USDC.The bifurcation on which project received what and which rubric was used is not available in the public domain.1188×730 106 KBAnalysisThere are three main Safe Wallet accounts with 12+ unique owners and only two of them have received any OP from these distributions and that too less than 2k OP. This statement aims to offer context to the forum discussion in which misappropriation was raised. However, it doesn’t fully resolve the discussion, as it was not examined through an investigative lens.In total around 1.3mn OP still remains unallocated in different addresses, including USDC. Considering Pool Party Rewards reduction in OP allocation, the funds usage in the near term is not available in the public forum.Grants disbursed to at least13 projectsby Perpetual will have a long term benefit for the mutual growth of Optimism and the grantee.This is impactful, wish to see remaining grants disbursed to more builders.The platform managed to draw in liquidity, possibly owing to its reward system. However, this influx of liquidity has proven instrumental in Perpetual’s efforts to enhance their project’s user interface and user experience, as well as to fortify themselves for future surges. This accomplishment can be viewed as just one of the numerous objectives the Optimism community anticipates from the grant recipient.RecommendationsRetroactive Distribution Procedure: Create a process for protocols to seek Governance Fund approval for retroactive OP distribution. The Governance Fund should have the option to approve or decline such requests.Timeline for grant distribution: Faster timeline can be enforced for the growth of the ecosystem and the grantee. At times, this can be the key for technical innovations too as it can attract more users.Grant Usage Guidelines: These can be established based on insights gained from previous grant allocations. This includes assessing the permissibility of actions like converting OP to another token or utilizing allocated OP for voting purposes.Closing RemarksConsidering the challenging circumstances the community and space have faced in the past year or so, the protocol has performed quite admirably.There is certainly room for improvement, but is it possible to reclaim the allocated funds in cases of delayed allocation or failure to meet specific parameters? This question arises from the observation that many past grants had a significant portion of their funds remaining unused in their wallets.Community can better answer it or there can be a stream of distribution from the foundation wallet, which can be stopped when clarification of funds use is in question. On second thought, after going through the grinding of a writing proposal and answering questions before it passes, autonomy to an extent shall also be granted to the teams.SourcesOP Analytics RepoIncentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc@optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive(OP Mainnet)Perpetual Protocol: Optimism Governance’s First FailureMessage to Optimism Community from Perpetual ProtocolIndependent Recovery PostI want to discuss project boosting their delegate power with governance fundhttps://perpprotocol.mirror.xyz/ForumSnapshotTwitter AnnouncementLiquidity MiningPerpetual Dashboard on DuneOptimism Deep-Dive by Project"

My Manifesto and Community-Building Plan,"My goal is to contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Optimism ecosystem, making it more accessible for users. Decentralization, community participation, and the empowerment of innovation are at the forefront of my priorities. I am committed to creating a fair and inclusive network where users have full control over the tools they utilize.To achieve this goal, I have outlined strategies for community building. First, I plan to prepare educational content about Optimism and Web3 technologies to share with the community. By regularly disseminating information, I will facilitate the onboarding of new users into the ecosystem through workshops and events, thereby enhancing community awareness and knowledge.I will actively engage with the community through interaction and feedback mechanisms, participating in forums and social media platforms. Listening to the needs and suggestions of members will be essential in increasing participation in governance decisions and creating a more inclusive process. Additionally, I will offer rewards and incentive programs to encourage active participation and contributions from the community. Collaborating with other projects and DAOs will also be a priority, as it will help expand the ecosystem and provide users with more opportunities.In terms of localization and inclusivity, I aim to connect with local communities to ensure that Optimism is accessible in various languages and cultures. I will work to create an inclusive environment where new participants feel a sense of belonging within the community. I also place great importance on transparency and accountability. By providing regular reports on my activities, I will reinforce the community’s trust in me and maintain transparency throughout all processes, sharing governance decisions openly.In conclusion, I am dedicated to building a strong and sustainable ecosystem where the community has a greater voice. Contributing to Optimism becoming an innovative and leading protocol that enhances the global adoption of decentralized technologies is one of my primary goals. Throughout this process, I am committed to being the voice of the community and actively working towards collective development at every stage."

Accelerated Decentralization Proposal For Optimism,"Authors:@GFXlabsContributors:@MattL(contributions to L1 Bridge Escrow section),@Juanbug_Pgov(general commentary)If you hold OP, please signal your approval of this accelerated decentralization on this Snapshot petition.MotivationThe promise of the OP token is to govern the Optimism L2 software. However, to date, neither Token House nor Citizens’ House has the power to execute code. In fact, governance does not even control its own governance contract. Optimism governance governs exactly nothing in its own right today, relying upon the Foundation to even create proposals. This stands in stark contrast to Optimism’s main competitor, Arbitrum, where the ARB token has complete system control over Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.Optimism governance launched more than two years ago. Over this time, governance has matured considerably, with increased capacity for decision making, increasingly robust checks and balances, and professionalization of many elected positions. While there was some early value in the Foundation and OP Labs having all system access powers, that time has passed as both the promised decentralization of power and the business strategy of Optimism have underperformed expectations.Transferring all system powers, resources, and access to governance can relieve OP Labs and the Foundation from their burdens, and allow them to focus on the tasks they do best. It will also offer rejuvenation to a system that is currently stagnating with only de minimis progress towards decentralization, and a business strategy that appears to be high in cost and low in benefit.Like an aging parent whose own capabilities are no longer growing, we hope Foundation and Labs will embrace our view that it is time to let the Optimism governance provide the vigor, clear direction, and focus on delivering value to tokenholders that they cannot. This is not an attempt to push either entity into irrelevance or diminish their contributions that have helped raise governance to a level of maturity and responsibility that it is ready to take the lead.With that goal in mind, we have divided this plan into three phases of decentralization, to be completed by summer of 2025. Phase I, which governance contributors desire to see immediately, consists of resources that are ostensibly owned by governance and governance infrastructure. The immediate handover of control over funds and governance assets does not put any user funds at risk in any way, and does not insert governance into the core smart contracts.Phase II consists of items that, while not core contracts of the protocol, are essential infrastructure that will require an orderly handover and cannot realistically be done immediately. They can, however, be accomplished swiftly.Phase III is all remaining privileges, access, and control of onchain contracts and assets, and represents a complete decentralization of governance.Phase I (Immediate)OP Token Contract OwnershipUnlike some competitors (like Arbitrum), the OP token has no established rights to execute code, make proposals, share in revenue, or anything else.This manifests itself as a lack of interest in OP as a governance token, making it a struggle to convince some users to delegate or vote. In some circles, OP is actually referred to as a meme coin, and not jokingly so.Of particular embarrassment is that the OP token does not even own its own contract. Transferring ownership of the token contract to governance is an essential first step in a credible plan to make the OP token serve its intended purpose of governing Optimism.Putting the token contract under onchain governance oversight also ensures that basic tasks will get done, like deploying standardized OP token contracts on Superchain member chains and a reliable, quick mint-burn bridge between those chains. This is of particular urgency with the Superchain grants program scheduled to dispense 12,000,000 OP tokens to member chains, but with no way to reliably get those tokens to those chains.Governance Contract OwnershipMuch like with the OP token, the governance contract used for voting is not under governance control. This leaves governance dependent upon the Foundation’s approval to present proposals for a vote. Lack of governance control has also resulted in episodes where the governance contracthas been upgraded without the knowledge, much less the consent, of governance.Because the governance contract currently controls no parameters of Optimism mainnet, giving onchain control of this contract to OP tokenholders can be enacted immediately.For the avoidance of doubt, governance ownership of the governance contract includes a permissionless way for delegates to submit proposals for a vote.Governance Fund OwnershipThe OP tokens in the Governance Fund should be transferred to an address controlled by the governance contract.ETH Collected on Behalf of Optimism Collective Comes Under Governance ControlThere iscurrently 15,397 ETH collectedfor the benefit of Optimism governance, spread across several addresses under Foundation or Optimism Labs control. This ETH, minus a buffer for operational costs recommended by Labs, should be transferred to an address on L1 controlled onchain by Optimism governance.Phase II (concluding end of Q1 2025)Bridge L1 Escrow Comes Under Governance ControlOP Bridge currently holds several billion dollars in assets that could be deployed across Ethereum mainnet to generate revenue for Optimism governance. Utilizing bridge assets is being made common by other chains, most notably Blast, Mantle, and Gnosis, withPolygon looking like it will follow suit.While we do not propose a plan for utilizing these assets or any immediate changes in where they are held on L1, we do believe it is a decision for governance to make. This is particularly important from a sustainability perspective, since the current vision for Optimism revenues are tied to sequencer revenues on Optimism and Superchain members. As sequencer revenues trend towards zero over time in an intensely competitive marketplace, the bridge is an obvious way to permanently create sustainable revenue streams over the long term for governance and the maintenance of Optimism.Sequencer Decentralization RoadmapOP Labs and/or the Foundation should present a plan to decentralize the Optimism mainnet sequencer before the end of March 2025. This plan should include specific actions to take and requirements. The plan also must include a target date to decentralize the sequencer for Optimism before the end of Q2 2025.If this date to decentralize the sequencer is determined to be unfeasible within the decentralization plan, then the plan should also present specific actionable steps to ensure the current sequencer operator is directly accountable to governance for major parameters.Revisions and Re-Ratification of the Law of ChainsThe Law of Chains was not drafted by governance, though governance ratified it. The Law of Chains will be reviewed for conflicts with this roadmap and other governance priorities, and revised, or re-ratified as is by governance. A schedule to periodically revisit the Law of Chains will also be established to ensure that it serves the needs of governance in its task to protect, grow, and generate value for Optimism stakeholders.Phase III (concluding Q2 2025)Full Control of Optimism by Optimism GovernanceComplete technical control over the Optimism protocol should be handed over to Token House, Citizen’s House, and various bodies appointed or elected by Token and Citizen’s House. This handover can be done by empowering the current governance contract or by providing a new architecture that is approved by governance.The Foundation is encouraged to seek a permanent seat on the Security Council and potentially other privileges, but those should flow from authorization by governance and not from the Foundation’s own authority.Foundation Grants DisclosureNo later than the end of Q1 2025, the Optimism Foundation should commit in a binding manner to disclose to Optimism governance all past and ongoing grants. To the extent some of this information may not be made public, the Foundation must offer to make this information available to appointed representatives of Optimism governance.Completed Decentralization of the SequencerBarring legal or technical blockers, the sequencer should be decentralized according to the plan presented by OP Labs and/or Foundation in Phase II.If you hold OP, please signal your approval of this accelerated decentralization on this Snapshot petition."

Create your own Developer Reputation Scores - OpenRank Web Tool Intro,"ContextReputation scores for Developers and OP stack GitHub repos are used formetrics in Retro 5.  They are based on calculating recursive trust across the Github developer activity graph, powered by OpenRank and OSO. This ranking is seeded by OP Stack repos. This means Github repos and developers are scored based on recursive trust signals, originating from these seed trust repos.A graph of relevant GitHub event data from Open Source Observer, covering more than 2,000 organizations and over 30,000 code repositories, was used in generating these scores. The graph has two kinds of peers: GitHub users and repositories. We then used a variation of EigenTrust — the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, which computes rankings on an asymmetric bipartite trust graph. The following visualization shows the repos and developers as nodes, and how they are forming an integral web.Screenshot (237)1155×1070 217 KBWe believe introducing reputation metrics is important because 1) voters need better signals to know if a repo is contributing to OP stack and to what degree is that contribution; 2) voters need signals to know if a repo has been interacted by reputable developers, which adds to an underlying endorsement of the value of the repos.For Retro 5, a first version of the metrics is generated by OpenRank. This is just the beginning of experimentation with reputation based metrics. We look forward to your feedback and input in making the scores and rankings more relevant and meaningful.Now you can create your own Rankings and Reputation scoresWe’re excited to launch a client for anyone to create their own version of reputation scores. Check it out here:https://devrankings.openrank.com/It allows any user to understand how the reputation scores are computed, and create their own custom rankings. The cool part about this is that the OpenRank compute is happening client side.Step 1: Select ranking criteria- which is basically recursive trust arcs that are taken into consideration to quantify interactions between nodes in a trust graph. Here we set as default the same criteria as used in Retro 5. In this version, you don’t need to change or configure this.Screenshot (243)1428×1195 153 KBStep 2:Input any Github developer handle or repo as Seed Trust- this input is used as Seed Trust for the recursive trust graph. Trust propagates from these repos through interactions outlined in step 1, to the rest of the repos and developers, based on one’s proximity to selected Seed Trust. In Retro 5 metrics, OP Stack core repos were used as Seed Trust.Screenshot (244)1432×520 59.8 KBStep 3:Select a seed strength (between 0 and 1) -this alpha value (α) is a parameter in EigenTrust which determines the degree of influence of the seed peers in deciding the reputation scores of peers in the graph. Alpha value is normally chosen between 0 and 0.5 and the higher the alpha the stronger the influence of seed peers, meaning the trust arc from seed peers to other peers will matter more for a peer’s relative reputation.Finally, you can generate and download the your customized reputation scores.Screenshot (245)1457×793 41.7 KBAccess the scores via BigQuery tables:openrank-data.devrank_2024{0627,0910}.{user,repo}_scoresThere are two versions of the scores used in Retro 5, and you can access it via OSO data portal too:openrank-data.devrank_20240627has the scores used forOptimism Retro 5 guest voter selection.

OP Stack chain List,What chains are currently using OP Stack? And what kind of chains do you plan to release in the future?It would be helpful if you could provide me with a page where the list is indicated.
Setting sunny eyes on Latin America,"-For some months now we have been creating things at Optimism, with a lot of intention to help create, maintain communication and impact for the awareness of people in Latin America. With this we are going to start helping our communities about the Optimism Governance, what is RPGF, Granting and everything that it’s happening in the collective.a.- What is the purpose of this thread?To have a link for the community to communicate and keep an eye on what we are creating. This thread is not intended to enliven a single community, but all those who intend to create and share their work.b.- The intentions of this thread?Communication, communication communication. We consider that there are many communities that don’t know how to navigate in the forum, they are frightened by the content and we would like to have a special place where we can communicate with each other.c.- Some rules are not bad-It is totally forbidden to post bad intentions and attacking content to any community.-We do not support ghost communities, which only come to promote themselves, so the joint happiness will come from allowing any latin community to promulgate themselves here or promulgate the work done.-No hate comments, sales or anything related to economic aspects.d.- The method1.- In this thread we will have postings of what is going on weekly, which can be content from delegates, missions, intents to consider and links to important documents in a clean, communal manner.2.- If you are doing any projects, meetings or you would like to communicate with us, we will read each other here.3.- This thread is for impact, to keep people aware of what is going on and for Latin America to allow more communication and interaction between projects.4.- We are going to have a TG group to talk about Optimism and solve any doubts.-Ill be updating with all the TG groups that are going to share help and explanations:Nación BanklessTelegram: Contact @nacionbanklessCome in friends.

Rewards for users,its looks bullish for all ecosystem but how can the users engage more in round 6 and which dapps and protocols are consider more for rewards i think we need to discuss some on it to make it more clear and easy .
Formal request after being ignored 24hrs,"Optimism “Foundation”,. MediocreI am writing to formally contest the exclusion of my wallet (0x8fea…6aae17) from Airdrop 5. After a thorough review of my on-chain activity and comparison with your stated criteria, I believe there has been an error in the evaluation process.As per your announcement, Airdrop 5 rewards “power users who have contributed to the growth of the Superchain Ecosystem” with activity between March 15, 2024, and September 15, 2024. My wallet’s activity on Base alone demonstrates that I clearly meet and exceed these criteria:Transaction volume: 5,049 total transactions, 3,769 token transactionsETH volume: 294.325114 ETH (approx. $695,235) transactedConsistent activity: 352 days active, spanning 229 unique days, 47 weeks, 13 months and 10%+ contract to txProtocol diversity: Interactions with 13 different protocols including Uniswap, Aerodrome, Relay ProtocolBridge usage: 30.8507 ETH ($72,873) deposited via multiple bridgesAdvanced participation: 8 contract deployments, interactions with various DeFi protocolsHigh-value transactions: Multiple transactions exceeding $10,000This on-chain data irrefutably shows that my wallet fits the description of a “power user” contributing to ecosystem growth. The volume, diversity, and consistency of transactions clearly align with your stated criteria.I request a thorough review of my wallet’s activity and a detailed explanation for its exclusion from Airdrop 5. If an error has occurred, I ask for immediate rectification and inclusion in the airdrop.I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.Sincerely,Wallet: 0x8fea…6aae17I have been ignored on forum, banned from discord and Twitter.

SEED Latam: an invitation to Latin American coordination,"Dear friends,Following our analysis of Season 4, we have written some reflections:How we started@SEEDGovwas supported by members of its community in its early years. However, it also greatly benefited from its early entry into the DeFi ecosystem and receiving airdrops and rewards that were given to pioneers who interacted with protocols before the DeFi Summer. The price increase of multiple tokens held in ourwalletallowed us to have runway and sustain a team of 5 people for three years (from 2020 to the present).SEED Latam in RPGF2In therpgf2, we received 55k $OP. We see this as recognition of our long-standing work, which materialized in the vote of the Badgeholders. We are taking an active role in managing these funding. In fact, we recently restructured SEED Latam in response to this input of $OP tokens to maximize the efficiency of our budget and avoid any wasteful spending. You can see the new SEED Latam statutehere.Some observations about the Latin American crypto ecosystemWe believe that the Latin American ecosystem is going through a stage where hundreds of teams are emerging and putting their efforts into spreading crypto adoption. We live in a region where the challenges are significant because we not only need to teach Web3 knowledge in a “friendly” way but also basic concepts of financial education that were not covered in the elementary education of most Latin American countries.We have noticed a significant increase in educational initiatives in general, and the same is true within the Optimistic collective.In such a large region where Spanish is the official language of 21 countries, coordination and complementarity seem to be the most intelligent approach. We mention Latin American countries because it is the region where we were born and where we work. However, we are not oblivious to countries like Spain, Andorra, Equatorial Guinea and other Spanish-speaking regions worldwide (for example, Miami). This gives us a broader reach in linguistic terms.Creating educational material in Spanish is important, and we greatly value the work of#translatorsand#contributorswithin the Optimistic collective. However, producing original content in Spanish with a critical perspective is more challenging and requires more time and resources. And this is what we need—a critical perspective to adapt the benefits of Optimism to our region.To provide some perspective, here are some data points:In the last Gitcoin round, there were 220 projects in the Education and Community category, of which54 were from Latin America.In thecurrent round of QF by CLR Fund, out of 45 projects, 19 are from Latam. One falls under the tooling category, one under content, and the rest are all Education and Community initiatives.In the RPGFs of Optimism, there were13 initiatives from Latin America, with only 3 in the tooling and research category.A new approach to incentivizeEducating retail and building communities is important, but it is also crucial to create incentives for research and development of tools and infrastructure. If we fail to do so, the Latin ecosystem will continue to follow trends rather than contribute new discussions and tools.To the governance of Optimism: Teams in our region operate under very different conditions than teams in other regions, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.To the Latin ecosystem: we can set the task of attracting web2 builders to Optimism on the horizon. We could explore categories such as research, tooling, and infrastructure too.To the Optimistic collective: we need to start considering the task of developing classification filters with acapture-resistantapproach as one of our priorities.In this regard, SEED Latam did not submit a proposal for theMission Proposals. We believe that we are an established team. We have never monetized nor will we ever monetize our content or any other actions generated by us (courses, events, hackathons, etc.). Being an initiative that generates Public Goods does not entitle us to indiscriminately ask for funding in every financing round that comes up (both within the Optimism ecosystem and beyond).Everything mentioned above is based not only on safeguarding the health of Optimism but also the health of the entire ecosystem. For example, the RPGF2 was an experiment that, with its successes and failures, serves as a model for other chains to review. The clearest case of this isthis proposalin the Arbitrum forum, where theRPGF2 is mentionedas a parameter for thinking about a superior and definitive model for grant allocation in Arbitrum.In that regard, we applaud and celebrate the work ofGrants Councilconsidering complex and specific rubrics at this time seems to be the wisest approach for evaluating initiatives. This translates into better allocation of resources and, consequently, a greater impact on communities.To Latin and global teams: Good faith and an Optimistic Vision should be the guiding principles for every action we take. We have seen several submissions in this stage. In a bear market context, it is difficult to maintain contributors, especially in Latin America, and it is natural to seize funding opportunities as soon as they arise. However, we must be careful when applying and evaluating. The lack of quality or differentiation in initiatives diminishes the real impact, and this can discourage the arrival of better proposals or cause them to migrate to other ecosystems. We run the risk of thehuman oracleapproving new proposals of lower quality than in the previous Season simply because “something needs to be approved.”If we manage to work in a coordinated and complementary manner, we can grow as a region and help the inhabitants of Latin America. We are at a crucial point where Ethereum’s scalability options are emerging, and we can attract more people to Optimism.Together, we can bring forward proposals that truly benefit the ecosystem with unique ideas, avoiding repetitive attempts to exploit the system.Let’s not miss the opportunity to use Optimism as a protocol for human coordination.P.D.: Aquí tienes unlink en Españolcon la traducción de este post, o más bien, con la versión original en Español"

[GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Synapse Protocol,"Project Name:Synapse ProtocolAuthor Name:Max BronsteinDefilama TVL (at snapshot):$38.9MTransactions/day (at snapshot)23Tier:2Optimism Native:NoRevisions to metrics used:N/ANumber of OP tokens to claim:1,000,000L2 Recipient Address:0x2e07DA88586C442aDE6A442106A04eDc7378265dProposal for token distribution:BackgroundSynapse Protocol is a cross-chain communications network used to seamlessly interconnect all blockchains. The Synapse Protocol is comprised of a messaging framework and an economically secure method to reach consensus on the validity of cross-chain transactions which developers can leverage to build truly native cross-chain applications.The Synapse Bridge is the first user-facing product built on top of the protocol. Our bridge allows users to easily send a variety of assets across 16 EVM and non-EVM blockchains. In a short span of time, our bridge has become one of the most widely used and trusted bridges, processed over $10 billion in total volume, servicing hundreds of thousands of users as well as mass scale dapps like DeFi Kingdoms.Synapse launched support for bridging into and out of Optimism 6 months ago and we’re thrilled about the opportunity to continue supporting the ecosystem in its new phase.How will tokens be distributed?The Synapse Ecosystem has a few core constituents:DevelopersLiquidity ProvidersUsersToken HoldersSynapse’s proposed $OP distribution will benefit all of them.DevelopersAmount:150,000 $OPAs an extensible cross-chain communications network, fostering an ecosystem of developers who create cross-chain enabled applications is our top priority. Since Synapse connects Optimism with 15 different unique blockchain ecosystems, more applications/projects built on top of Synapse translates into more potential user pathways into Optimism.While we continue to build new open source developer tooling and release new documentation, we will also be launching a Grants program to encourage more community members to help build and grow the Synapse Protocol. As part of this grants program, we would use a portion of our $OP to fund any community tools or applications that help users on other chains connect with Optimism and more generally help existing Optimism projects better tap into cross-chain liquidity.Liquidity Providers & UsersAmount:450,000 $OPWe currently support two stableswap pools for bridging into and out of Optimism:StablecoinsETHCollectively, both pools have faciilitated nearly $120 million in volume.Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 1.00.50 PM984×118 8.67 KBWe currently incentivize each pool with close to 12k SYN (around $36k) per week, or roughly 624,000 SYN (around $2m) per year and have close to $30m of TVL across both pools. Given our stablecoin pool was launched more recently, it only represents 20% of our Optimism TVL.We plan to use a portion of the $OP to incentivize our existing stablecoin pool on Optimism to create a much deeper pool for users to trade / bridge into. Along with the new OP incentives, we will add USDT and DAI to the pool which currently supports USDC and nUSD liquidity. Combined with the SYN emissions we are already contributing, we believe this will be one of the more attractive stablecoin pools in the market and will bring many more users into the Optimism ecosystem. Similarly, since the Optimism ecosystem is still nascent, we think this will become the deepest stableswap pool on Optimism, allowing users to seamlessly move in and out of different stablecoins.The more liquidity supplied in each pool, the cheaper it becomes for users to bridge between chains due to a reduction in slippage. This is important as we have noticed from experience on other chains that quite a lot of users have a preference to use stablecoins as a medium for bridging, rather than ETH. As the Optimism ecosystem grows, users will need a seamless solution to enter it, and we intend to Synapse to be that tool.Token HoldersAmount:400,000 $OPHistorically, most SYN liquidity has lived on a number of Ethereum based pools, namely SYN/ETH, SYN/FRAX, and SYN/FEI. This has priced out a lot of prospective holders given the gas fees. In an effort to make it more affordable for users to acquire and trade SYN, we propose creating a new SYN/Stablecoin pool on Curve’s Optimism instance. As the Synapse network continues to decentralize, it will be imperative for there to be affordable venues to acquire SYN and participate in the cross-chain message validation process.We would direct a portion of the $OP towards incentivizing this pool to ensure proper liquidity.  As soon as liquidity is sufficient, we expect a strong influx of users onto Optimism. SYN tokens are currently being emitted on over 10 chains and lots of liquidity providers, especially small to medium sized ones, do not necessarily want to pay ETH gas fees to trade their rewards. Bridging SYN to Optimism to trade it will become natural for those liquidity providers, therefore leading to a large influx of new wallets on Optimism. Additionally, that pool will constantly be arbed vs. other SYN pools (including SYN/ETH where the price depends of ETH) leading to an additional pick-up in activity.How will the distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?More BuildersMore tools and applications built leveraging Synapse means more avenues for users to enter the Optimism ecosystem.Stablecoin LiquidityAdditional liquidity incentives for our Optimism stableswap pool will increase Optimism TVL, in turn making Optimism one of the most efficient venues to trade stablecoins through. The more TVL that enters the ecosystem, the better it is for users, and the more potential users that Optimism can lock into their ecosystem.More Optimism UsersWith the SYN/Stablecoin Curve pool on Optimism, we expect more users will enter the ecosystem in order to 1) more affordably trade SYN and 2) bridge their SYN and stablecoins into optimism. Both equate to more Optimism users and TVL.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?All of the projects that are funded by our grants program will persist long after the $OP has been used. Many of the developers that are onboarded through the grants program will be exposed to building on Optimism, and may end up dedicating more time to building future projects in the ecosystemOur TVL has been much stickier relative to other networks. We expect liquidity providers, users, and traders of our Optimism pools to be quite sticky.The SYN/Stablecoin pool we’re proposing will very likely be the most affordable avenue for users to trade SYN far after the incentives are done as all of the main liquidity sources still lives on Ethereum. For reference, there was a SYN/AVAX pool created last year on Trader Joe. While this pool is no longer incentivized, it still has around $500k of TVL and a daily turnover which is sometimes higher than its own liquidity.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributedWe expect for these incentives to be distributed over the course of the next 6 monthsHow much will your project match in co-incentivesSynapse is planning on emitting at least 312,000 SYN tokens (around $1m) to liquidity providers on Optimism in the next 6 months"

However much of that impact is largely unknown for the following reasons:The builders we fund are strong builders, but not necessarily marketers.We haven’t had the infrastructure to automate a decentralized marketing function.Thus, stories of Optimism builders go mostly untold; their impact unknown.This Mission aims to provide the needed infrastructure and support to spread awareness of the Optimistic Vision:We leverage ThriveCoin and the Thrive Protocol to automate, scale, and bring on-chain the entire contribution incentive, validation, and rewards processes.We work with the Ambassador Program to incentive contributors capable of producing and marketing high-quality content.We work with the Optimism Foundation, top delegates, and top contributors to ensure Ambassadors are making truly valuable contributions.Contributions will be focused around researching, creating, and sharing the stories of the 300+OptimismandRPGFfundedprojects.We will create a content framework (“path”) that guides proper research, content creation, and content marketing.While the Mission is ongoing, we will look at data + feedback from the community to constantly evolve the initiative to achieve agreed upon metrics.We expect our proposed Mission to create significant impact:It will amplify the work of the Ambassador Program, automating the onboarding, mobilizing, and incentivizing of Ambassadors.It will inspire the research, creation, and marketing of an anthology of real-world use cases of the tangible impact of our Optimistic Vision.It will incentivize builders even more - because they will get free marketing and exposure for their work and impact.It will clarify for badgeholders the impact of Optimism-funded projects, thereby allowing them to make more informed decisions on future funding.While a one-time Mission, this provides a potential long-term solution for this and other endeavors that can be fine-tuned Season after Season.Below is a draft of contributions we propose to incentivize existing and new ambassadors to make in service of our Mission.

The easy-to-use widget and SDK allow developers to easily integrate cross-chain capabilities into any existing product. With that users can move and swap assets without having to choose the right bridge or worry about available liquidity.Apart from the B2C showcasetransferto.xyz(originally designed as a demo, now already driving a lot of traffic) more and more products are integratingLI.FIas the go-to bridge aggregator. Examples of current integrations are Alchemix, SpiritSwap, Frontier Wallet, Rubic, Etherspot, Treehouse, or specifically on Optimism: DeFi Saver, Perpetual Protocol, Etherspot, Superfluid, Omni.There are further contracts signed and tests running with bigger integration partners such as the largest wallets in the space (>20M monthly active users), which will then enable driving even more liquidity to Optimism throughLI.FI.Project links:Website:https://li.fi/Twitter:https://twitter.com/lifiprotocolDiscord/Discourse/Community:LI.FI / TransferTo.xyzBlog:https://blog.li.fi/Github:LI.FI (Li.Finance) · GitHubSubstack:https://lifi.substack.com/Additional team member info (please link):Philipp Zentner (CEO):https://twitter.com/PhilippZentner/https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippzentner/Max Klenk (CTO):https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxklenk/Vilen Rodenski (Product Design):https://www.linkedin.com/in/vilenrodeski/Ed Zynda (Solidity Lead):https://twitter.com/what_the_funcMatthias Moeller (Backend Lead):https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-moeller/Adrian Weniger (Frontend Lead):https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-weniger-8a35b6132/plus many other team membersPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:N/ARelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)Unique users: 80,342Transfer volume: 260,434,102 USDTotal transfers: 216,237Bridges supported: 10Networks / Chains: 17DEXs: 17Competitors, peers, or similar projects:Bridges and bridge aggregators such asAcross,Axelar,Connext,Hop,Celer,Socket,Via,Rango, etc.Is/will this project be open sourced?open source and audited contracts, widget, B2C app and SDK can be found here:LI.FI (Li.Finance) · GitHubOptimism native?No (on several chains, 17 in total)Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:December 2021Ecosystem Value Proposition:What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?Users often have tokens on other chains and would like to use dApps on Optimism. For projects or dApps it’s significant development effort to be multi-chain compatible and complex to navigate the current bridging landscape.How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?We provide an SDK and Widget which makes it easy for projects to support OP and enable users to bridge any token to OP without having to choose a bridge or leave the dApp.Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?More bridging integrations for Optimism and projects providing such within the dApp will be a key factor to enable Optimism usage and adoption.Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?NoNumber of OP tokens requested:200,000Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?NoIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?N/AHow much will your project match in co-incentives?The co-incentives we’ll provide are technical support for integrating bridging to Optimism as well as content marketing based on in-depth research.We currently value our hands-on development support at $5k-$20k per project per month. We’d like to provide dev integration support valued at $20k per month (1-4 projects / month) over a time period of 6-9 months (up to $180k) in total.Apart from technical integration one of our biggest strengths is the content we produce, especially regarding the bridging space, to support understanding of emerging ecosystems. In the past we’ve e.g. written the bridges articles for the Ethereum Foundation (e.g.Introduction to blockchain bridges | ethereum.org) or published educational content regardingArbitrary Messaging Bridges.We’d love to create content in terms of Optimism bridging in general (which we’d be happy to white label) as well as for specific projects. Marketing channels we will use to spread such knowledge are content posts in Twitter Threads, announcement articles, cross-chain insider newsletter, substack, Q&A interviews, Twitter spaces, Discord/Telegram and additional ways on a per team basis.Proposal for token distribution:As a bridge aggregator we provide the most straight-forward path for users and projects to onboard to Optimism. We’d like to support this with financial incentives for users (initial gas) to get started on Optimism as well as financial and technical support for projects to enable bridging to Optimism throughLI.FI.How will the OP tokens be distributed?Incentivize transfers to Optimism by providing initial gas for all bridges (50%)In terms of initial gas we believe 0.003 ETH (~3.8 USD) for users after first time bridging is a good starting point to make transactions and interact with dApps on Optimism. At the current OP/ETH price we could onboard roughly ~26k new users to Optimism with that.Support projects to integrate bridging to Optimism throughLI.FI(50%)We’d like to enable more projects to support Optimism and onboard users from other chains to Optimism. For that we’d like to provide different grants to such projects depending on the size and complexity of the integration. Smaller ones (<10k) for simple SDK / widget integrations and larger ones for deeper integrations including e.g. cross-chain contract calls.The priority will be for projects deployed on Optimism and seeking bridging from other chains.In addition to these grants we’ll provide technical and content marketing support to such projects, especially larger ones.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?Currently we expect the time period for distribution to be around 6-9 months. This may vary though depending on market development, developer/user adoption, project integration speeds and further external factors.How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?The initial gas amounts will make it easier and more financially attractive for users to move assets to Optimism and start using dApps there.The financial and technical support for bridge integration will enable more projects to easily allow their users to adopt Optimism coming from other chains.Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.KPI for initial gas incentives:number of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to OptimismKPIs for project support to integrate OP bridging:number of projects supporttotal amount of financial support / grants given out to these projectsnumber of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to Optimism (same as above as requested in feedback comments)Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?Over time users will be used to the UX of bridging to OP and enjoy the simplicity of being able to do so directly through different dApps’ integrated swapping/bridging capabilities powered byLI.FI. This improved first user experience with dApps on OP will provide a great entry point for more long-term usage.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:Smart contract addresses can be found here:Deployments - LI.FI Documentation"

Check out the announcementhere.Project Description, Optimism Alignment & Ecosystem Value Proposition:Sushiswap is currently one of the leading decentralized exchanges which was launched in August 2020. The protocol adopts an AMM model and has facilitated over $225.05B worth of trades since its inception.Sushi products deployed on Optimism (Over the past 3 months):TridentSushiXSwapComing soon: Limit orders, Kashi, MISO & Permissionless Onsen Farms, Trident Stable Swap PoolsThe team at Sushi plans to use this grant to help increase the liquidity of the Optimism ecosystem.How will the OP tokens be distributed?All of the OP tokens granted to Sushi will be distributed to liquidity providers who help bootstrap the initial Optimism liquidity for Trident with cross-chain swaps via SushiXSwap being the focus. SushiXSwap is a unified, multichain UI for swapping tokens across any of the major chains.The team solves the liquidity crunch by plugging into our own Sushi liquidity pools which are currently deployed on over 18 different chains. Being able to use this liquidity guarantees our users to always receive the best price for any pair across all the chains. SushiXSwap can be currently usedhere.With cross-chain swaps in mind for the rewards, we’re proposing to incentive these 3 pairs to start:OP-ETH 1% (500 $OP per day for 180 days)ETH-USDC 0.05% (1500 $OP per day for 180 days)ETH-USDT 0.05% (800 $OP per day for 180 days)OP rewards will be used to bootstrap the 1% fee tier for OP-ETH, and 0.05% USDT/USDC - ETH pairs. Each of the pairs will be constant product pools (50-50), and will have TWAP oracles enabled. With the OP rewards we will be targeting around 10% APR on $10m in TVL for ETH-USDC, $5m for ETH-USDT, and $3m for OP-ETH.With liquid ETH-USDC & ETH-USDT pools an easy gateway will open up to allow users on other chains to easily swap tokens from the source chain to Optimism tokens. Main benefit being the ability to top up gas on Optimism wallets via swaps on any source chain Sushi is deployed on.For example w/ fee tiers and stargate’s 0.06% bridge fee, users will be able to swap from MATIC on Polygon to ETH on Optimism with a 0.16% fee. Also with a 1% fee tier on the OP-WETH pair it will ensure that swaps from any chains on Sushi will be routed through the Optimism OP-WETH pair with all of the fees staying within the OP ecosystem.How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?Sushi has plans to co-incentivize the liquidity pools as well. With targeted 10% APRs on the pairs, we believe this provides enough rewards to bootstrap the main pairs enough to get things kick started for cross-chain swaps and help increase the activity & usage on Optimism. We’ll also be looking to bootstrap other pairs with SUSHI as they work their way into the onsen program. With increased liquidity on OP, it’ll also open the opportunity for native projects to have a place for their token to become liquid for cross-chain swaps as well.Added benefits in the form of BentoBox’s strategies will also deploy idle capital (OP, WETH, USDC, USDT) within the Optimism ecosystem, and thus will help aid in increasing usage and liquidity across OP.Sushi has previously run similar dual rewards for LPs on Polygon, Gnosis, MoonRiver, Fantom, etc.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?The plan is to kickstart cross-chain activity with bootstrapped OP rewards for 180 days, and SUSHI rewards continuing after the OP rewards end (potentially also recycled Sushi from fees w/ implementation ofMeji proposal). Expectations are that volume will reach levels that it continues to be profitable w/o rewards, and liquidity will be sticky enough for long-term usage of the cross-chain swap functionality.Additionally, Sushi has plans to deploy each of our other products on Optimism and with bootstrapped liquidity it will be a good kickstart for activity from day one with the additional products like Miso, Kashi, Furo and Limit Orders.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?The rewards will be distributed over a 180 days period.Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what’s the status of these tokens?Sushi has not received any grants from OP. This is the first proposal submitted.How much will your project match in co-incentives?Initially Sushi will be able to reward similar rates as we do on other chains, with 100-300 SUSHI per day being the initial targets for each pair plus expansion into rewarding other pairs as they pop up or work into the onsen program.300 Sushi per day for ETH-USDC250 Sushi per day for ETH-USDT150 Sushi per day for OP-ETHThe above are rates similar to what we incentivize on Arbitrum (700 sushi per day in total).Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:Sushi’s Treasury (ETH Mainnet): 0xe94B5EEC1fA96CEecbD33EF5Baa8d00E4493F4f3"
[DRAFT][GF: Phase 1] Growth Experiments Grant: BTC holders bridge to Ethereum in a trust-minimized way,"Growth Experiments Grant: BTC holders bridge to Ethereum in a trust-minimized wayBasic DetailsProject name:Threshold tBTCAuthor name and contact info:John Packel,john.packel@gmail.com, hello@threshold.networkL2 recipient address:0x7fB50BBabeDEE52b8760Ba15c0c199aF33Fc2EfAWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?Season 3, Cycle 11Project DetailsWhat are you building?tBTC is a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant Bitcoin bridge. However, Bitcoin holders cannot leverage their BTC in the Optimism ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.With thelaunch of tBTC v2it’s now possible to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum in a trust-minimized way. We propose a solution to bridge tBTC to Optimism in the near-term.To make the user experience of bridging tBTC from L1 to Optimism as seamless as possible and to avoid the proliferation of non-compatible wrapped tBTC tokens resulting in fragmented liquidity, Threshold will implement a minter contract that delegates restricted minting authority to the native Optimism bridge, along with a short-list of ecosystem bridges (e.g. Wormhole, L0, etc.).This contract will have a minting authority for TBTC on Optimism but can be paused by any one ofntBTC guardians (Threshold tBTC Guardians - General - Threshold Network), allowing avoidance of contagion in case of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.Later, Threshold may implement the ability to mint tBTC directly from Bitcoin on Optimism, without Ethereum L1 as an interim step, if it is sensible to do so.Please see a full discussion of the approach here:https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/pull/542/files?short_path=1eac321#diff-1eac3218e60358ae0a0073e86b51a233f1b9294b6d0b441a534d41f92c983f7cWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?Threshold is the network formed by the first-ever decentralized network “merger” betweenNuCypherandKeep. Version 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL, but the security model of stakers providing 150% collateralization in ETH was very capital inefficient.Combining networks, communities and stakers, we launched tBTC v2 on January 31st. In the several month period before permissionless minting, a nominated group of “Minters” (in partnership with Curve DAO), Yearn.Finance, Synthetix, Connext and Alchemix) make the decision to mint tBTC instead of stakers, with a failsafe group of “Guardians” (Catalog, BadgerDAO, Stake Capital, Entropy, and many community members) given the opportunity to cancel fraudulent or improper mints.If this grant is approved, the solution will bridge Optimism to the largest digital asset in a trust-minimized way, enabling BTC to be used as collateral in the lending protocols, AMMs, and derivatives platforms on Optimism.How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate:Version 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL. Key metrics for v2 are available here:https://dune.com/threshold/tbtcHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism?Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism:We propose to deploy a canonical tBTC contract on Optimism that is flexible enough to:Delegate restricted minting authority to a short list of ecosystem bridgesDelegate restricted minting authority to the native Optimism bridge, in the futureBe paused by any one of n guardians, allowing avoidance of contagion in case of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.Be governed by the Threshold Council until we can land on a longer-term cross-chain governance mechanism.Rather than change our L1 implementation to be aware of L2s and sidechains, we’ll start as simply as possible. Every tBTC mint will continue to require transactions on Ethereum from the user — first a deposit reveal, then a lock to bridge to Optimism.Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.tBTC targets Bitcoin holders who want to do more with the asset by participating in DeFi. Defining characteristics include a strong preference for decentralized solutions over the highly centralized WBTC with its custodied asset approach by BitGo and selected merchants.How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?The process of bridging from L1 to Optimism would look as follows:There is a tBTC holder on L1. The holder goes to the Wormhole Portal and selects Optimism.The holder submits one transaction to L1 locking their tBTC tokens in the bridge’s smart contract. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15 minutes for the Ethereum block finality.The holder submits one transaction to tBTC on Optimism. After that transaction is mined, they have their tBTC on Optimism.The process of bridging from Optimism to L1 looks as follows:There is a tBTC holder on Optimism. That holder goes to the Wormhole Portal and selects Optimism.The holder submits one transaction to tBTC on Optimism that is burning the token. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15 minutes for block finality.The holder submits one transaction to L1 unlocking their tBTC tokens from the bridge’s smart contract. After that transaction is mined, they have their tBTC on L1.This smart contract is integrated with step 3 of L1->L2 bridging and step 1 of L2->L1 or L2->L2 bridging. When the user redeems token on Optimism, this contract receives the Wormhole tBTC representation and mints the canonical tBTC in an equal amount. When the user sends their token from L1, this contract burns the canonical tBTC and sends Wormhole tBTC representation through the bridge in an equal amount.Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:Demo:tBTC Minting Demo VideoPermissionlessly Bridge your Bitcoin to Ethereum DeFi with tBTCWebsite:https://threshold.network/Twitter:https://twitter.com/TheTNetwork,https://twitter.com/tBTC_projectDiscord/Discourse/Community:Threshold Network ✜Github:GitHub - threshold-network/threshold: Threshold Network tooling.Technical/Economic Documentation:https://docs.threshold.network/Threshold DAO Notion site:https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/Welcome-to-the-Threshold-DAO-3e51fdedbd804ff1b11f00a7c750b118Do you have any metrics on the project currently?

The founders of NuCypher areMacLane WilkisonandMikhail Egorov, who later founded Curve Finance. The founder of Keep isMatt Luongo.What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal?Threshold contributors have a track record of shipping multiple Top 100 projects with meaningful adoption, as referenced above. Other projects built by former or current NuCypher/Keep core team members includeFold,Taho Wallet,Curve Finance,Entropy, andSunscreen.Is this your first Web3 project?No.If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.):Please reference the previous answer above.Grant RequestWhat is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max)200,000 OPHow do you justify the size of the grant?This is an appropriate amount given the enormity of the capital in Bitcoin and holders desire to lend, borrow, stake, etc. The OP tokens will be allocated as incentives on qualified protocols.Roadmap and Distribution PlanDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:Minter contracts will be deployed to Optimism. The first ecosystem bridge will be whitelisted on the contract. A liquidity pool will be deployed on Curve and, potentially, Velodrome. After a sufficient amount of liquidity builds (facilitated by OP incentives), tBTC will become an interesting collateral for lending protocols like Sonne and Euler. Further use cases may be developed across the Optimism ecosystem, such as derivatives (e.g. Lyra, Synthetix v3).How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See theno sale rule here 1):To encourage the rapid development of tBTC TVL, 100% of the OP tokens will be distributed as incentives for users to mint/bridge tBTC on Optimism. The OP tokens will be allocated as incentives on qualified protocols potentially including Curve and Velodrome for liquidity, Sonne Finance and Euler for lending, and Lyra and Synthetix V3 (once new collateral types are enabled) for derivatives.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?We propose distributing the OP tokens over 2-3 months towards qualified protocol (e.g. Curve, Velodrome, Sonne, Euler, Synthetix V3, Lyra).Please define benchmark milestones for this project.Baseline milestones:tBTC minter contract deployed on Optimism by May 1, 2023tBTC factory pool on Curve deployed on Optimism by May 15, 2023Integration with at least one lending protocol (e.g., Sonne or Euler) - timing dependent on that protocol’s readinessPlease provide critical milestones for this project.Remaining 60% of OP grant allocated after the following critical milestones have been reached:100 tBTC bridged by July 15, 2023tBTC factory pool surpasses current size of sBTC/wBTC pool (66 BTC as of 3/13/23) by July 15, 2023Potentially integration with at least one derivatives protocol (e.g. Lyra or Synthetix V3)If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?Liquidity begets liquidity. The OP incentives period will enable tBTC to bootstrap itself on Optimism via integrations with Curve, Velodrome, Lyra, etc. With a sufficient amount of tBTC bridged to Optimism, liquid spot + derivatives markets, and arbitrage opportunities between OP tBTC<>L1 tBTC<>native BTC continued organic usage of tBTC on Optimism is likely after incentives dry up.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.):docs.threshold.networkEthereum MainnetOptimism RelationshipDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?Bitcoin holders cannot leverage their BTC in the Optimism ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. tBTC on Optimism will provide the decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant Bitcoin bridge that many Bitcoin holders prefer.Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?tBTC’s long-term goal is for 10-20% of Bitcoin to bridge to Ethereum. Our version 1 proved the demand in spite of its capital requirements, tBTC v2 is the best decentralized solution and many of our users will choose to bridge via Optimism.Is your project Optimism Native?NoConfirmationsI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 28 and Growth Experiments 29 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:YesI understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a “no sale rule,” as explained in this post, and I have read the terms of the rule:Yes"

We follow a quit…Project OverviewProject description (please explain how your project works):Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure bridge between L1 and L2s. Across protocol is a novel bridging method that combines an optimistic oracle, bonded relayers and single-sided liquidity pools to provide decentralized instant transactions from rollup chains to and from Ethereum mainnet.Across Protocol supports bridging to and from Optimism from Ethereum mainnet and L2s. UMA launched Across Protocol in early November 2021. Across is a bridging solution which uses UMA’s Optimistic Oracle.Project links:Website:https://across.to/Twitter:https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocolDiscord/Discourse/Community:AcrossPlease include all other relevant links below:Github:Across Protocol · GitHubDocs:https://docs.across.to/bridge/(you can find our audit here)Additional team member info(please link):Hart Lambur, Kevin Chan, David Korpi, Nick Pai, and many more.

The mission of Risk Labs and our project teams is to make global markets universally fair, accessible, secure and decentralized. UMA is an optimistic oracle (OO) that can record any knowable truth onto a blockchain. The OO empowers and secures a diverse ecosystem of web3 applications including the Across bridge.https://umaproject.org/Relevant usage metrics(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):Total Bridge Volume: $664,763,116TVL: $62,864,876 in totalTotal Unique Bridge Users: 105,409Total Transfers: 215,631Community-built dashboard can be found here -https://dune.com/unionepro/Across-Protocol-StatsCompetitors, peers, or similar projects(please link):We consider Hop (https://hop.exchange/), Stargate (https://stargate.finance/), and Synapse (Synapse Protocol) to be our closest competitors for the chains we operate on.Is/will this project be open sourced?Yes.

This can leave users feeling “stuck” on L2 if they don’t trust or aren’t aware of bridge protocols that can help them move between chains in a much shorter period of time.A thriving L2 ecosystem is only possible if we also have a competitive and robust network of bridges to support connection between chains. Bridges are particularly vulnerable to exploits, so many newcomers to the ecosystem might be unsure about trying a bridging protocol.Our proposal aims to solve the above problems by providing an on/off ramp to the ecosystem that will be nearly instantaneous in both directions, and nearly free of cost for users traveling TO Optimism. Our fully audited bridging solution is built on top of UMA’s Optimistic Oracle, which has been battle tested for nearly 2 years and secures hundreds of millions of dollars.Users will only receive the tokens if they bridge assets to Optimism or run a relayer on Optimism. Both of these require people to move their funds to Optimism, and our hope is that they will find all the great dapps on Optimism and want to stay!How much will your project match in co-incentives?(not required but recommended, when applicable):Across will match up to 320% in co-incentives using the ACX token. Details on this can be found below in the Distribution section.Proposal for token distribution:We have two planned mechanisms for the distribution of $OP tokens. We will use 75% of the tokens to subsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer assets to Optimism. Currently, we support USDC, ETH, DAI, WBTC, USDT, BAL, and UMA. The remaining 25% of the tokens will be used to reward anyone who runs a relayer on Optimism.Bridge UsersFor any user going to Optimism, Across will provide $ACX incentives alongside the $OP. The amount of this $ACX co-incentive can be as high as 320% of the $OP incentive dependent on whether or not the bridgooor uses an Across referral link to do their transaction. An example of how it could be that high is if a user self refers in Across, they will receive 80% of their bridge fee in $ACX and only 25% in $OP (for a total of 105% rebate). 80%/25% is a 320% co-incentive. their bridge fee 105% (so they will earn 5% to bridge to Optimism). The composure of this rebate depends on whether or not the user is already earning $ACX rewards on their transaction. If there is no $ACX reward, the bridge fee will be rebated back 80% $OP and 25% $ACX. If there is an $ACX reward, the $OP amount will be (105%-$ACX%). All of this will be computed on the bridge fee component of a transfer and capped at 12 basis points (which covers the entire fee during periods of low to moderate bridge utilization.)Note: Across differentiates between the bridge fee and the gas fee. This distribution is only applied to bridge fees, so network conditions that cause an increase in gas fees should not make an impact in this program. For more information on our bridge fees, you can seethissection of our docs site.RelayersWe will direct 25% of this grant towards rewarding relayers that facilitate transfers to Optimism. This will be dispersed as 0.01% (1bp) on the amount transferred in each relay. For context, this is equal to a 33% bonus for relayers operating on Optimism. This incentive will last until the 25% is exhausted.Note: This was an addition to the original proposal, which only rewarded bridge users. It was decided that this would serve to enhance the overall bridge experience for Optimism users, making it a worthwhile investment. Having a robust relayer network strengthens the security mechanism of the bridge, and reduces transaction times during high traffic events.DistributionAcross will provide $ACX incentives alongside the $OP. The amount of this $ACX co-incentive can be as high as 320% of the $OP incentive dependent on whether or not the bridgooor uses an Across referral link to do their transaction. An example of how it could be that high is if a user self refers in Across, they will receive 80% of their bridge fee in $ACX and only 25% in $OP (for a total of 105% rebate). 80%/25% is a 320% co-incentive.The rate of distribution will depend on many factors. The main ones include amount of bridging we see to Optimism, whether or not it’s through a referral link, and the Optimism token price. It is expected that we will spend these tokens at a slower rate than other bridges since other bridges are able to incentivize Optimism liquidity pools, whereas our bridge model does not require a liquidity pool on each destination chain. (Note: we believe this is a good thing, as incentivizing LPs can cause mercenary capital to farm rewards). Given all of these factors, we estimate 12-18months for distribution. We believe this is an appropriate amount of time to distribute the tokens, primarily because we hope to establish long-term association for users bridging to Optimism. These tokens will help to make it nearly costless and effortless to move assets to Optimism when it makes sense for users to do so. If the grant distribution time is too short, it could unintentionally generate activities that attempt to farm the reward.We also recognize that there will be external factors that may lead to farming as well. In such an event, we would expect to adjust the OP rewards distribution in a way that reduces this farming potential. Our goal is not to allow users to farm and sell $OP to bank a profit and not use the optimism ecosystem. We will keep the optimism delegates aware of any such actions, should they ever be necessary. We would like to be the bridge of choice for any user that ever needs to move tokens to Optimism as more and more assets migrate to Optimism.Depending on the optimism token price and whether or not people use ACX referral links, this program should fund between $500 million and $1 billion of volume to Optimism.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)You can find links to all of our smart contracts in our docs site (linked above). The wallet listed above as the receiving wallet will hold these tokens until a distribution contract has been deployed. Upon doing so, this information will be supplied to OP governance for additional accountability."

This makes Optimism more discoverable and accessible to a wider audience, including users of Snapshot, Tally, DAOhaus, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of DAOstar One. This alignment, among other things, allows for increased interoperability, fostering innovation.Increased Transparency and Legitimacy: Being EIP-4824 compliant ensures that Optimism can reap the benefits of DAOstar’s Regulatory Interoperability work, improving its transparency and legitimacy.Knowledge Sharing and Standardization: The governance standards will facilitate better knowledge sharing and create a standardized framework for DAOs on Optimism. This will contribute to developing more informed voters and a more robust and resilient governance infrastructure.Community Education and Inclusion: The mission includes an educational component, where we plan to conduct community outreach and create user-friendly interfaces to interact with the governance standards. This will educate the broader community about Optimism governance and promote a welcoming and inclusive governance community.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?DAOstar is a public goods project that develops interoperable standards and critical public infrastructure for DAOs. It is supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Aragon, Radicle, MolochDAO, MetaCartel Ventures, The Graph, and many other members ofDAOstar One.DAOstar is the standards body of the DAO ecosystem. We build interoperable standards for DAOs and DAO tooling. Our members include 80+ key organizations across the DAO ecosystem, including every major DAO framework, a large number of DAO tooling developers, and many major DAOs. Over 150+ people actively participate in DAOstar. You can find the full list of membershere.DAOstar’s technologists and working groups work closely with legislators, regulators, and legal groups in many jurisdictions (US, UK, Australia, Singapore, UAE, Utah, Vermont, New Hampshire, etc.) to make sure that the industry’s technical standards both align with and inform emerging regulations.In its first year of operation, DAOstar has published three standards, with three additional standards planned for release in Q2 2023.See the DAOstar Impact Report (13.06.2023) for complete details.EIP-4824 / DAOIP-2: Common Interfaces for DAOsIn February 2022, we established a DAO Standard by introducing EIP-4824 on Ethereum, an API standard for DAOs.DAOIP-3:Attestations for DAOsDAOIP-4: Proposal TypesIn this last year, notable governance frameworks such as Aragon V3, Moloch V2/V3, DAOstack, Superdao, DAODAO, KaliDAO, and others have embraced the EIP-4824 framework.Aave recently passed a proposal to adopt the standard.We are actively collaborating with ENS and Gitcoin to facilitate the same.Our Alliance’s combined experiences make us well prepared to execute this Mission.Joshis the executive director of Metagov and a computer scientist at Oxford and CMU. He is the standards lead of DAOstar and author/editor of several emerging standards for DAOs. He previously held fellowships at Stanford, Princeton, and MIT. His research on collective intelligence, DAO constitutions, DAO data sets, and online community governance directly applies to the mission of developing governance standards for the Optimism ecosystem. His work on online governance and technical interoperability between DAOs underscores his commitment to advancing solutions that enhance the DAO landscape on Optimism.Isaac, the co-founder of Shield 3, brings to the table extensive experience with DAOs, DAO security, and DAO governance. His role as the lead engineer on the EIP and its initial implementations demonstrates his technical prowess and ability to drive innovation. His previous role as the Chief Technology Officer of Bloom Protocol, an interoperable identity platform, further underscores his expertise in creating secure, scalable solutions. His skills and experience make him a key asset in the mission to develop robust governance standards for the Optimism ecosystem.Scott Moore, co-founder of Gitcoin and an advisor to Metagov, also serves as a Delegate for the Optimism Foundation and the Founder of Public Works, a fund focused on constructing essential public infrastructure. His diverse roles and contributions to the open-source ecosystem and his deep understanding of the Optimism Foundation’s vision align perfectly with the mission of enhancing governance standards within the Optimism ecosystem.Aman, with a background in physics, serves as the community lead at DAOstar and the Growth lead at DeepDAO. His experience in community engagement and growth strategies will be instrumental in fostering a robust and inclusive community around the governance standards being developed for the Optimism ecosystem. His skills will ensure these standards are adopted and utilized effectively within the community.Please list acritical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.The successful implementation and deployment of the EIP-4824 standard in the Optimism ecosystem, confirmed by Optimism and at least three other large DAOs on Optimism publishing a daoURI.This milestone will involve the completion of the following sub-goals:Engaging with OP Labs, delegates, and other community members to understand their needs and preferences for the data to be published through daoURI (Community Engagement and Requirements Gathering).Based on the feedback from the community engagement stage, building the necessary endpoints and assisting the DAO in publishing a daoURI (Design and Feedback Incorporation).Repeating the community engagement and design stages for other DAOs on Optimism, ensuring each DAO’s unique needs are met (DAO-specific Customization and Onboarding).Building the necessary frameworks and implementations to make it easier for DAOs on Optimism to achieve EIP-4824 compliance. This includes a snapshot integration that will enable any snapshot space on Optimism to build a daoURI easily and reference sub-graphs and endpoints that can guide other DAOs (Framework Development and Compliance Facilitation).How should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.Community Engagement metrics (Ongoing): Track the number of interactions with OP Labs, delegates, other DAOs on Optimism and community members. This may include meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions. Regular updates on these interactions can be shared via a dedicated communication channel, such as a dedicated Discord channel or another preferred communication medium like the Optimism forum.Implementation Progress (Ongoing): Monitor the progress of the implementation phase by tracking the number of endpoints/sub-URIs created and their functionality. This could be done through regular updates on a project management tool or dedicated discord channel.DAO Onboarding Rate (Quarterly): Measure the number of DAOs that have been onboarded and are publishing a daoURI. We’ll deploy a subgraph to listen to daoURI registration events.Framework Development Progress (Ongoing): Monitor the development of the necessary frameworks and implementations. This could be done through code commits on a platform like GitHub.By tracking these indicators, Token House delegates can independently measure the mission’s progress, separate from the achievement of specific milestones.How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.DAO Adoption:Measure the number of DAOs on Optimism that publish a daoURI. A higher number indicates wider adoption of the governance standards and greater impact.Efficiency of Publishing:Assess the ease of publishing a daoURI on Optimism, measured by the turnaround time between community sentiment and the on-chain transaction of publishing a daoURI. A shorter turnaround time indicates a more efficient process, reflecting a positive impact on the mission.Data Consumption:Track the number of services on Optimism that consume DAO data from daoURIs. A higher number indicates that the governance standards are being utilized and are providing value to the ecosystem.EIP-4824 Extensions/Implementations:Count the number of extensions or implementations of EIP-4824 for specific use cases on Optimism. This indicates the adaptability and usefulness of the governance standards in addressing diverse needs within the Optimism ecosystem.These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the mission’s impact, covering adoption, efficiency, utility, and adaptability.Breakdown of Mission budget request:Community Engagement and Requirements Gathering (10% of the budget): This includes resources needed for meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions with OP Labs, delegates, and other community members.Design and Feedback Incorporation (20% of the budget): This covers the resources needed for the design phase, including creating endpoints based on community feedback.DAO-specific Customization and Onboarding (20% of the budget): This includes resources for customizing the design for specific DAOs and assisting them in publishing a daoURI.Framework Development and Compliance Facilitation (45% of the budget): This covers the resources needed for developing the necessary frameworks and implementations to facilitate compliance, including a snapshot integration and reference sub-graphs and endpoints.Operating Costs (5% of the budget): This includes miscellaneous expenses such as software subscriptions, website hosting fees, and communication tools.This allocation ensures that sufficient resources are dedicated to each critical aspect of the mission, from community engagement and design to implementation, onboarding, and compliance facilitation.I confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones:YesI confirm that I have read and understand thegrant policies:YesI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:YesI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlinedhere:Yes"

Follow their code on GitHub.GitHubConjureUser Created Synthetic Assets. Conjure has 8 repositories available. Follow their code on GitHub.GitHubKeychain-IncKeychain-Inc has 8 repositories available. Follow their code on GitHub.Please explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:Scry is the only framework in the space that allows anyone to create and run a fully independant oracle with full node, contract and even front end control. All other oracle systems require a token and permissioned signers that are unknown to the user.This allows the space to create an open and decentralized underlying layer for data being brought onchain. The only way to decentralize the Optimism network would be not just the layer 1 and 2 but also the core and key components to allow developers and users to have open source and decentralized tools powering their dapps and use cases.We have a framework that allows even non technical users to run fully autonomous oracles fully independently with no control by any other party. This includes the contract, the signers and the node. By allowing anyone to run an oracle in a sustainable, profitable and open way the dapps on top also become decentralized.This helps understand the missionscryprotocol.substack.comIntroducing Data LPsWhat are DLPs?What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?We have developed many of the tools already. We show capability by doing. You can explore the docs atdocs.scry.financeto see the tools in action. We smply want to continue being able to build, improve and create these tools and spread awareness and decentralization at our core.Please list acritical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.Build a fully capable node with documentation and contract system that can be used by anyone to run a fully jndependant oracle. The following features will be developed that are NEW and not already seen as we already have super powerful and key tools for apj interfaces for arbitrary endpoints and VRFCross chain data access by interfacing with layer 1 and able to access data such as block data, contract state and balances. This alone would allow for much more secure contracts that can access layer 1 state.Cross chain access to external chains that are EVM compatibleOnboard atleast 3 other parties to run nodes and be data providers, showing them on an interface for discoverabjljty and to show that the tools are operational and able to be used independantly.

This will provide a new use case for OP and should be ready by RPGF cycle, but not the priority. TVL/net stake for OP could be used if ready by then.Breakdown of Mission budget request:130k for developer compensation. Includes bringing on other devs to help build out the infrastructure, tools, front end, docs as needed. Am personally full-time and have been burning through my own savings in developing this up to now with 0 funding. Will allow this to be more sustainable40k for bounties and reviews for security using agreement on token allocation on unlock30k User and project incentives for running and using the infrastructureI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones: YesI confirm that I have read and understand thegrant policies: YesI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: YesI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlinedhere: YesFurther notes and contextFor reference you can already deploy your own oracles with the tools, on OP, using binaries or fully with ur own stack, so if you are skeptical can just try deploying your own!docs.scry.financeShould we receive a grant from OP we will build the infrastructure for OP to be used on the Optimism network as the collateral token creating a new use case in exchange for supporting what we do.To be clear we are seeking a grant to enable us to keep being able to build these tools sustainably and keep the core infrastructure open source, permissionless and free, as well as not require tokens. We are looking at a token later potentially if needed but the token would only be for us to have some way to sustain the free and open source and permissionless tools and infrastructure we create. We currently have had no funding, other than a 5k in OP from retro pgf and are fully self funded up to now from our own funds personally. So the only path forward would either be a token or a grant to keep being able to build."

Protocols have a choice of where to deploy and Velodrome and matching our efforts with targeted incentive programs provide the most compelling case for a focused investment in the Optimistic vision.That is why we believe that to grow awareness and engagement with the Optimistic Vision, we need to employ every avenue at our disposal to get access to those builders that could be of interest to Optimism. And in our experience, no amount of words or guides alone can compare with direct, in-person engagement. This grant would support Velodrome’s own considerable efforts to grow the ecosystem and provide the tools to continue to attract the best and brightest in Web3 and get them invested in the Optimistic Vision.We propose 100,000 OP to be used as bounties to incentivize individuals in the Optimism community to surface and introduce new protocols to Velodrome to onboard to the Optimism Collective. We would target bounties of roughly 2k per referral. Bounties would not go to people currently employed by Optimism Labs, the Optimism Foundation, or any affiliates, nor would they go to currently titled and compensated people on the Grants Council.We will pair these incentives with our ongoing efforts to promote the Optimistic Vision and ecosystem through our official comms channels (Twitter, Discord, etc), our business development activities (50+ protocols onboarded to date), and our partnership support that helps projects get engaged in governance and connect with other ecosystem builders.This grant request is about equipping those already doing the work of spreading the Optimistic Vision with the demonstrated effective tools they need to be successful.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Our Alliance’s combined experiences make us well prepared to execute on this MissionVelodrome is the single largest protocol on Optimism and the largest DEX on Layer 2 Ethereum, it is the most prominent public advocate for the Optimistic Vision across the DeFi landscapeVelodrome has a proven record of persuading builders and users to embrace the Optimistic vision, attracting, onboarding, and retaining protocols / builders / and their communities to Optimism (50+ and counting)Velodrome has a demonstrated track record of running successful grant programs and delivering results, holding ourselves accountable to the metrics we lay outPlease list acritical milestone.

His current part-time gig at The Smurfs’ Society has also given him a comprehensive understanding of web3.On the other hand, Antoine, an ex-management consultant and former PMO at ABInbev, blends his strategic thinking and organizational skills with a rich knowledge of web3, garnered from roles such as Ecosystem Lead at Argent and his previous work at The Smurfs’ Society.1600×1386 267 KBWe both got hooked on web3 and digital assets back in 2017, and it’s been a wild ride since. Watching friends, ex-colleagues, and even family navigate the web3 maze led to an idea - a curated and hand-picked web app to top-notch web3 apps, resources and tools.Maxime holds the responsibility for the technical development of Web3xplorer, including incorporating new features and enhancing the user interface and experience based on users’ feedback. In addition, he plays a significant role in boosting our SEO and marketing game. Maxime will also assist in curating content and populating our database with pertinent web3 applications, resources, and tools. On the other hand, Antoine’s responsibility is to find and curate web3 applications, resources, and tools, and write articles (such as this one).Please list acritical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.Web3’s main hurdle right now is its complexity, making it tricky for beginners to wrap their heads around it. For a lot of people, it feels like wrestling with both the convoluted world of the internet and the complexities of finance simultaneously. Our aim is to make web3 navigation smoother and to tackle the issue of discovering the right apps, tools, and resources. We’ve outlined the following milestones to help us do just that:Milestone 1:By July’s end, we aim to expand our listings by featuring a minimum of 500 new applications/tools/resources, with at least 150 of these actively available on Optimism. Each application listing should include a basic description, a Q&A segment to guide users, a snapshot of the website, and their Twitter and website links. Some apps might also feature links to external useful resources (e.g. video to set up a specific wallet).Milestone 2:By mid-August, we expect to significantly enrich the Optimism page with comprehensive information and external resource links that explain Optimism, demonstrate how to bridge, provide links to governance forums, and more. This page should also include a detailed FAQ section to assist newcomers.Milestone 3:By early September, we plan to establish and launch the blogging section of our website, which will serve as a crucial tool for disseminating information and resources about Optimism.Milestone 4:By mid-September, marking the end of the season, we should have composed and published approximately 10 detailed articles focusing on Optimism. These articles will cover topics like what a layer 2 like Optimism is, what users can anticipate from it, guides to bridging and using apps, and more.How should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.By July 31st, we’re aiming to list over 500 new apps, including 150 active on Optimism. That’s our goal to help grow the ecosystem.By August 17th, we’ll jazz up the Optimism page (Optimism | Web3xplorer) with much more info.By September 4th, we’ll have our blogging section live and kicking.By September 18th, you should see around 10 articles about Optimism up on our site, linked right from Optimism’s dedicated page on Web3xplorer.How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF.To see how much impact this mission’s had, badgeholders can look at two main things:How many unique folks visited Web3xplorer during Season 4. More visitors means more people are catching on to what we’re doing.The total page views for apps that are up and running on Optimism and the Optimism page itself. This shows how much people are interacting with Optimism-related content on our site.We’ll supply the relevant stats and info from our web analytics tool to measure these two factors effectively.Breakdown of Mission budget request:Assuming a standard workweek of 40 hours with an hourly rate of 50 OP:Development of the blogging functionality: We’ll be using NextJS and exposing blog content over an API (Strapi) while storing the data in a PostgreSQL database in markdown format. This would take about 3 weeks, or 6000 OP.Expanding our database: We’re planning to load up our database with a heap of new apps and tools. This would require about 4 weeks of work, which equates to 8000 OP. We estimate that each app listing will take us between 15 to 20 minutes.Writing blog articles: We have a target to create 10 blog pieces, which we expect will take us about 2 weeks or 4000 OP, at a rate of one article per day.Please note: Some of the funds might be used to reward contributors who step up to help us find and verify content, as well as contribute towards creating awesome articles.I confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones:YesI confirm that I have read and understand thegrant policies:YesI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:YesI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlinedhere:Yes"

We are currently working on a story-driven visual novel, more airdrops and additional gamemodes to Defend Dragonia.Proposal for token distribution:How will the OP tokens be distributed?80% - Player rewards and incentives; players that earn XP through winning games can gradually unlock rewards in the  current season pass. Token distribution will gradually be added to these reward pools  to incentivize playing.20% - Marketing and community growth to drive more attention/traction, as well as expenses (such as server hosting costs).How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?GOAL: Showcase P2E gaming and the benefits of building on OptimismThe token distribution will be used to grow the player base and incentivize playing matches. To help sustain this project’s development and incentivize user interaction/engagement, this funding proposal would help us to continue expanding the Dragonia ecosystem (more games, more action!) and community.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?Dragonia has many different rewards such as NFTs, cosmetic skins and other planned partnerships (e.g. WL spots for other projects that can be earned through playing).Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?There is no set period for token distribution as of right now. Considering that there are approximately 3-4 seasons yearly (each with unique lore and updates), token distribution allocated for rewards should last multiple seasons but ultimately depends on the number of players.How much will your project match in co-incentives?Dragonia does not have a token. However, players can earn NFTs via our season rewards (earned through winning matches) and other airdrops. We will also create some special in-game art + NFTs for this event."

Having more active and interested delegates would be a huge benefit to the Optimism Collective as a whole. But we have a problem… delegates have no insight into data on their own delegation. Currently the only information that is readily available to delegates on all major websites is the total amount of OP delegated and the # of delegating addresses. This limits the agency of delegates, especially new and growing ones, and as a result limits participation in governance.OPdelegate.comsolves these problems by creating the go-to website for Optimism Delegates. Specifically, it will provide address-specific information for delegates to understand, manage, and grow their delegation on Optimism. Think “zapper.fifor delegates”.Examples of statistics on this website would be:Total delegation over timenumber of delegating addresses over time“Demographics” of delegating addresses (size, activity, etc.)By having access to the most important information, delegates will have the agency to see how their decisions and activity affect their delegation, leading to the opportunity to make data-driven decisions. The existence of this tool will increase overall delegate involvement in governance and provide a growth for new and growing delegates.While the initial goal of this grant is to build a wallet-specific dashboard for delegates, the ultimate goal is to be a one-stop-shop for all things Optimism delegation. All parts of the website will be open-source, meaning that this code will be available for other projects to integrate and that outside contributors will be welcome to contribute.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Michael Vander MeidenThrough being one of the most active delegates in Optimism governance, Michael has experienced the key pain points of new and active delegates. Through hosting the community calls, Michael has been at the center of delegate discussion for almost the entire existence of the token house. Along the way, Michael has answered countless questions from and helped guide many new delegates just starting their journey. These experiences have made Michael one of the most knowledgeable within Optimism’s Token House on the delegate journey. All of this experience makes this Alliance strongly positioned to design and build the product that delegates need.As far as ability to execute, Michael draws on his experience as a software engineer and later a product manager at a venture-funded startup (http://www.stockwell.ai/). There he managed a remote team to build multiple applications, most notably a delivery and stocking app that cut driver stocking times by 40%.He is also a solidity engineer that has built many web3 projects and placed in multiple web3 hackathons, most notablyArbitrum’s 2022 hackathon, placing 1st in the DeFi track.Michael Silberling(advisor)Michael Silbering is a data wizard at OP Labs, and his work speaks for itself.

"[READY] [GF: Phase 1] xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and Uniswap V3 Staker","Note: xToken has amended its original proposal to integrate community feedback, such as allocating rewards fully to Optimism, allocating rewards fully to WETH<>OP 0.3% pool, and extending the program from 10 weeks to 6 months (24 weeks). Along with the increase in duration, we increased the amount of incentivizes requested to ensure deep liquidity.Project Name:xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and Uniswap V3 StakerAuthor Name:xToken Terminal and Gamma StrategiesNumber of OP tokens requested:900,000L2 Recipient Address:0x38138586AedB29B436eAB16105b09c317F5a79ddRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)xToken: $3.5M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)Gamma: $4.2M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)Optimism alignment (up to 200-word explanation):The following is a joint proposal by xToken Terminal & Gamma Strategies to outline a path forward for OP liquidity incentives on Uniswap V3. This is an updated version of our June 2ndpre-proposal, which received strong community support. From that version, we’ve reduced the amount of tokens requested – we recommend Optimism start with an initial 10-week program and then reassess continuation of the program.Terminal’s out-of-the-box solution allows projects to deploy a highly configurable Uni V3 liquidity mining (LM) program in a matter of minutes, no dev work or technical expertise required. Terminal is live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.Gamma has been actively managing liquidity on Uniswap V3 since March 2021 and prides itself on optimal LP strategies using its machine learning algorithms and automated strategies. Gamma is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and Polygon.The OP token is finally live, ushering in a new era for L2 Ethereum. For now, Optimism is the only leading ETH scaling solution with a liquid token. The OP token – which serves a focal role in the governance of the network – has already generated significant investor interest. As such, bootstrapping a strong, stable foundation of liquidity for the token is essential.While the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be bootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This is an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a commitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. We believe an OP liquidity mining program should be considered.Proposal for token distribution:We propose a total allocation of 900,000 OP tokens for liquidity incentives, distributed evenly across three providers: xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and UniswapV3Staker.After discussion with the Optimism community, we believe that 100% of incentives should be paid out on Optimism via the WETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool. Liquidity in this pair is most critical to the success of the Optimism token so we feel a full allocation is the best way to ensure adequate and sustained depth.For a detailed explanation of our analysis and initial design of the LM program, refer to ourpre-proposal discussion.How will the OP tokens be distributed?900,000 OP tokens distributed to LPs over a period of 24 weeks:~33% allocated to each service provider’s program100% paid out on Optimism100% to WETH<>OP 0.3% poolHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?With three different service providers, each will be able to approach liquidity incentives and provision in a way that complements the other two, providing a robust incentives offering for all types of LPs.xToken will provide a user-friendly interface for full range OP liquidity incentives, offering a passive option with lower IL and execution risk for community members who want a simpler LM experience.Gamma will actively manage OP liquidity, concentrating assets right around the spot price and structuring rewards through their platform.UniswapV3Staker will offer a more expressive, dynamic option for more sophisticated LPs looking to rebalance frequently and independently of other LPs.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?With a 24 week campaign, we’ll be able to attract long-term users and capital from ETH mainnet and other chains. We believe that the user experience and emerging opportunities on the Optimism network will be enough to retain the majority of users after the incentives program ends. As we mentioned above, Optimism is uniquely positioned to obtain LP capital with its native token being first to market of the major L2s.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?Linearly over a period of 24 weeks.How much will your project match in co-incentives?Due to their current emission allocations, it’s unlikely xToken and Gamma Strategies would be able to match incentives for this program."

Their support ensures high-quality design and development outputs.Advisor@thegrifft: Griff, a co-founder of Giveth, Commons Stack, General Magic, and DAppNode, brings valuable guidance and strategic direction to our project. His vast experience and leadership in these pioneering projects provide critical insights that help shape our course towards achieving our objectives.Please explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent(Have a look at thePraise Explorerorthis videoto learn more about Praise)Praise enables community members to acknowledge and reward one another’s contributions. It not only helps us identify who is contributing but also provides insights into the nature of their contributions. This information can be utilized to discern the types of contributions most valuable to the community.Employing Praise cultivates a culture of gratitude and appreciation. Receiving praise for one’s work can bolster motivation to continue such work, particularly vital for community members who contribute voluntarily. We believe this is directly aligned with the fourth intent’s stated goal of promoting a welcoming community.We aim to implement Praise on the Optimism Discord server and facilitate the necessary deployment process to ensure Optimism maximizes the benefits of using Praise. We will engage stakeholders, handle technical deployment, prepare the community, help “launch” Praise, and provide continual support.Praise creates a dataset containing information about who contributed what, when, and its impact. This data, apart from promoting a welcoming community, can serve as a basis for rewards and reputation.We plan to integrate Praise with Optimism Attestation Station and collectively define what attestations should be created with the community. Possible attestations include:Praise certifies that recipient A has received praise from giver B and has been awarded an impact score of X.Praise certifies that recipient A has accrued a total impact score of X during the defined praise period Y.Praise certifies that recipient A is among the top 10 praise recipients during the praise period Y.These attestations can then be employed to promote more equitable and diverse access to the Citizens’ House governance process, including RetroPGF rounds. Praise is a bottom-up process where anyone can appreciate anyone else for a contribution they deem valuable to the community’s goals. This inclusive method significantly lowers the barrier to participating in governance.In addition to creating attestations, we also aim to support Optimism in rewarding community members with OP tokens using Praise (subject to separate grant/governance decision). The token rewards are determined by the impact scores calculated by Praise. We will assist the community in defining the rules for distributing OP tokens based on these scores. Rewarding contributing members with OP tokens is an effective method to increase the votable supply and reduce the concentration of voting power.Using Praise to distribute retroactive rewards is very aligned with RetroPGF and is also a great way to distribute OP to the active and appreciated community members.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Praise has been tried and tested over several years and proven to be a useful tool for community building. We, the team have been working with the new version of Praise for the past 2 years and have deployed it for several communities includingGiveth,BanklessDAO,GnosisDAO,Shapeshift,DAppNodeand more.We have a deep understanding of the technology and community dynamics and are well suited to help Optimism deploy Praise and use it to its full potential.To exemplify, here are two successful deployments of Praise:Givethuses Praise to continuously reward contributors with GIV tokens.Quote from community member Suga:Praise is essential. I don’t think anyone in the community could imagine not having it. Praise is an integral part of the community, that is to say, being able and encouraged to support one another and recognize each other’s contributions forms part of the basis of what the Giveth community believes in.Token Engineering Commonsused Praise to track contributions during a number of months leading up to the launch of the Commons.Community members were awarded with the non monetary Impact Hours token for their Praise. Impact Hours were then used to determine how many TEC tokens each community member as how much they were trusted to be able to buy in the closed presale (that they called a Hatch), as well as how much they were rewarded at the launch of the token.Please list a critical milestoneThe critical milestone of this proposal is the development and integration of the attestation feature in the Praise Dashboard UI. The successful completion of this milestone would not only make issuing attestations easy and user-friendly but will also serve as a measure of the proposal’s overall execution.The steps to achieve this milestone includeMapping out the custom attestation needs of the Optimism community: This involves engaging with stakeholders and gathering feedback about the requirements and expectations for the attestation feature.Deploying Praise to the Optimism community and organising a demo session for the community members.Development and integration of the attestation feature into the Praise Dashboard: After successfully developing the feature, it will be integrated into the Praise Dashboard, enhancing its functionality and usability.Testing and refinement of the attestation feature: Rigorous testing will be performed to ensure the newly integrated feature functions optimally. Any issues identified will be promptly addressed and resolved.How should Token House delegates measure progress towards this MissionTask DescriptionMeasurement of ProgressExpected Completion DateMap out the custom attestation needs of the Optimism communityCompletion of the stakeholder engagement phase with the needs and feedback integrated into the project scopeJuly 26Implement Praise in Optimism community DiscordSuccessful integration and usage of Praise in the community DiscordAug 10Build and integrate the attestation feature into the Praise DashboardCompletion of each stage in the feature development process (planning, design, coding, testing)Aug 24Test and refine the attestation feature for PraiseSuccessful completion of the testing and refinement process, readying the feature for deploymentAug 31Deploy the attestation feature on PraiseDeployment of the attestation feature on the live Praise Dashboard UISep 6Organize Retroactive Attestations WorkshopSuccessful facilitation of the workshop allowing members to acknowledge past achievements and give PraiseSep 13Issue AttestationThe successful issue of a number of verifiable proofs of PraiseSep 20How should badge holders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Positive feedback or testimonials from community members using PraisePraise volumeNumber of active community members as measured by analyzing Praise dataAmount of new Citizen house members who received their eligibility to participate to the governance based on their attestationsAmount of OP tokens distributed as a rewards mechanism (subject to separate decision)Breakdown of Mission budget requestWe are requesting140K OP112K OP to improve governance accessibility through stakeholder engagement, implementation of praise in the Optimism community, the introduction of a robust attestation integration in the Praise dashboard UI, and providing community support.

Kyber is an Ethereum and DeFi pioneer, was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019, and now atop 3 DEX in terms of volume on Optimism.KyberSwap has been deployed on Optimism since July 2022 and shares its motivation for a collaborative cyberspace. OP and KNC incentives would be used by KyberSwap to drive user, liquidity, and ecosystem growth. In particular, KyberSwap plans to work together with top DeFi projects such as Lido, QiDAO, and Synthetix on joint growth activities, as well as leverage our strong presence in Southeast Asia (SEA) to grow the Optimism community (both users and builders) in the region.KyberSwap brings substantial benefits to Optimism users:For Traders:KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from different DEX pools (including KyberSwap’s), getting the optimal trade route and best price. This may even route volume to external DEXes such as Velodrome or Uniswap depending on the quality of liquidity, thus further contributing to the Optimism ecosystem. Traders can identify tokens that are ‘Trending’ or ‘Trending Soon’ using a detection algorithm that tracks on-chain metrics as volume and market cap.For Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools and earn compounding fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping and concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. By extension, this means OP grants used as liquidity incentives would result in a much bigger impact on liquidity and swap rates compared to typical DEXes.For developers: Optimism Dapps and wallets can integrate with KyberSwap pools and aggregation API to provide the best rates for their own users, saving time and resources. Chainlink is already supportingprice feedsfor the KNC token on Optimism so KNC can also be used as collateral on lending platforms.Project links:Website:https://kyberswap.com/|https://kyber.network/Twitter:https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/Discord/Discourse/Community:https://discord.gg/kyberswapDocumentation:https://docs.kyberswap.comGithub:KyberNetwork · GitHubAdditional team member info (please link):Founders and AdvisorsVictor Tran: CEO | Forbes 30 under 30| Twitter:https://twitter.com/vutran54Loi Luu: Heading Kyber Ventures | Forbes 30 under 30| Twitter:https://twitter.com/ loi_luu/Yaron Velner: Founder ofB.Protocol, current KyberSwap advisor | Twitter:https://twitter.com/yaron_velnerVitalik Buterin: Advisor, Kyber’s launchProposal author from Kyber teamShane Hong, Head of Strategy for DAO & Tokenomics | Email: shane@kyber.network | Twitter:https://twitter.com/shaneMkt| Telegram:shaneHkOther team members you can contact:Sasha Mai, Head of Business Development | Email: sasha@kyber.network | Twitter:https://twitter.com/mai_defi| Telegram:sashamaiMelvin, Operations Manager | Email: melvin@kyber.network | Telegram:mrkwhgPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:Kyber is a mature project that is a pioneer in the Ethereum and DeFi space and has been operational for 4+ years without facing any major vulnerability.Kyberinitiatedand co-launchedWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), the most used wrapped version of BTC in the DeFi space today, and we aim to bring similarly innovative initiatives to the Optimism space.Kyber has partnered withLido Financeto bring low slippage, optimized liquidity for liquid staking pairs such as wstETH (as well as USDC, ETH, LDO liquidity) to Optimism and Ethereum.Kyber haspartnered with Multichainto provide an alternative UI with seamless bridging of cross-chain assets to Optimism.Created the Waterloo Cross-chain Bridge in 2019, a decentralized practical bridge between EOS and Ethereum, which inspiredNEAR protocol’s Rainbow Bridge.Kyber has organized and participated in various hackathons that contributed to the launch of top DeFi projects.

But already deployed on Optimism.Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:July 13, 2022Ecosystem Value Proposition:What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?Deep crypto liquidity is essential for any burgeoning ecosystem such as Optimism, and this is relevant to both new and mature DeFi or GameFi projects alike. Market makers/liquidity providers need a capital efficient and flexible venue to add liquidity and earn from their contributions. In parallel, traders need a simple method to aggregate liquidity from different DEXes to swap tokens at the best rates. There is a lack of a single DEX platform that offers both important functions (efficient liquidity + best rates through aggregation) at the same time for users, while incentivizing them to participate in the Optimism ecosystem. Moreover, despite a fast-growing community in western regions, Optimism’s presence in SEA is not as strong as it should be; KyberSwap can help with that.How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?KyberSwap will use the OP grants to bootstrap and deepen liquidity for popular pairs on Optimism. This is achieved by incentivizing liquidity providers to deposit liquidity (and yield farm) into KyberSwap’sconcentrated liquiditypools, which would enable much more efficient use of their precious capital. KyberSwap would endeavor to utilize the OP grants in a sustainable manner so that liquidity is retained beyond the yield farming period. Moreover, KyberSwap will be using our own KNC funds to encourage more trading on Optimism, further contributing to volume and fees earned by liquidity providers on KyberSwap.Even external DEXes that are integrated by KyberSwap aggregator, such as Velodrome, Uniswap, Curve, BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, or Synthetix, benefit when we direct volume to them (via liquidity aggregation for the best rates).A combination of OP and KNC grants would be used with guidance from OP Labs to grow the Optimism builder ecosystem and community in SEA through grants and business development initiatives.ALL OP grants will be distributed to Optimism users for their benefit.The Kyber team or KyberDAO will not be receiving any of the funds.Grants would be allocated as incentives for popular token pairs that have the highest potential for usage and trade volume on Optimism. This is especially pertinent for pairs that currently lack concentrated liquidity support and are capital inefficient.The following pairs are already being incentivized on KyberSwap with KNC incentives as part of ourOptimism liquidity mining campaign:wstETH / ETHETH / sETHUSDC / DAIUSDC / MAIwstETH / USDCUSDC / USDTUSDC / sUSDETH / USDCUSDT / DAIOP / USDCwstETH / WBTCETH / OPwstETH / MAIOP / KNCETH / KNCmKNC / MAIKNC / LDOAAVE / KNCSNX / KNCPartners:We have partnered withQiDAOandLido Financeto facilitate deeper liquidity for their relevant token pairs on Optimism. The partner pairs being incentivized on Optimism:With Lido FinancewstETH / ETHETH / sETHwstETH / USDCwstETH / WBTCWith QiDAOUSDC / MAIwstETH / MAImKNC / MAIThe following pairs will be considered for OP incentives if we receive them (subject to change; will be further discussed with the Optimism team and community):USDC / SUSDUSDC / USDTUSDC / WETH / wstETHOP / WETH / wstETHDAI / WETH / wstETHUSDT / WETH / wstETHWBTC / WETH / wstETHUSDC / WETH / wstETHOP / USDCOP incentives may be allocated evenly between the pools or according to specific criteria such as the historical trading volume of the token pair and the liquidity level on Optimism etc. Roughly$2M worth of KNCwould be allocated to Optimism users for liquidity mining, with additional rewards for ancillary marketing and community activities.On top of these initial pairs and partners, we will also allocate a portion of grants for future partners.Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?1. Bringing users and developers to OptimismKyberSwap has many Dapp integrations with multi-chain exposure. Using the incentives, we want to enable more users and developers from other networks to bridge to and build on Optimism. This would be the case for popular DeFi projects as well e.g. QiDAO and Lido Finance, whom we are already working with on Optimism.Farming incentives, along with KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity, auto-compounding LP fee, and anti-sniping features, will increase TVL and volume, driving higher yields and attracting more LPs. We ran a similar campaign on Polygon last year and hit an ATH TVL of $145M.KyberSwap’s concentrated liquidity (through Elastic Pools) enables trades to have much better slippage for a given level of TVL when compared to a typical Uni v2 AMM DEX. For example, KyberSwap is alreadythe 3rd highest volume contributor on Optimismdespite not having received any OP and with much less TVL compared to other DEXes on Optimism.2. Deeper liquidity: Swap with better slippage and at the best ratesKyberSwap Elastic’s concentrated liquidity pools enable high capital efficiency for LPs; similar to the Uni v3 tick-based AMM but with compounded fees for LPs in a full price range pool and anti-sniping/JIT that protects earnings.Unique NFT liquidity position farming mechanism (the first in DeFi to our knowledge) which can account for both time of active liquidity provided and target trading volume of the pool.As a DEX aggregator, KyberSwap users always enjoy the best rates, and this indirectly brings volume and fees to other DEXes on Optimism e.g. Curve, BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, Uniswap, and Synthetix.Developers can integrate KyberSwap’s aggregator API to enable the best rates for their own Dapp users on Optimism. E.g. KyberSwap was integrated by DEXTools.3. Additional KNC marketing rewardsKyberSwap will provide additional KNC rewards on top of liquidity mining incentives through various marketing activities including referral campaigns, trading contests, lotteries, and airdrops etc., which would help attract more users to Optimism.4. Media coverage of OptimismKyberSwap will be spending resources for owned, earned, and paid PR/Media to promote the liquidity mining campaign and other activities, bringing further attention to the Optimism brand.5. Investments in the Optimism Ecosystem and Community, especially in SEAKyberSwap has a strong community and partner network in the SEA region. Pre-Covid, Kyber ran the largest monthly Ethereum meet-up events in Vietnam and is an active member of the Ethereum community in Singapore. We are long-time members of DeFi Alliance DAO and Asia DeFi Network. We have the experience to invest in and grow the Optimism community at the local grassroots level, especially in SEA.Kyber Ventures actively invests in DeFi/GameFi Dapps and builders and this would apply to Optimism-based projects too. This would help to grow Optimism’s Dapp ecosystem, which would in turn result in a rise in users, volume, and liquidity.Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback.This proposal is a resubmission under the new required proposal format. The previous proposal under the old format received positive support from multiple parties including at least 2 Optimism delegates:MoneyManDoug:https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-kyberswap/3302/16?u=shanemktMteoptimism:https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-kyberswap/3302/17?u=shanemktKyberSwap is currently a top 3 DEX on Optimism in terms of trading volume. KyberSwap will be allocating our own KNC token co-incentives (~$2M) to complement the OP grants requested.Number of OP tokens requested:250,000 OP.Note: We have revised our requested amount based on feedback from the Grants Council - Growth Experiment Grants subcommittee.Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?:NoIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?:N.A.How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable):Roughly$2M worth of KNCwould also be given to Optimism users for liquidity mining, with additional rewards for ancillary marketing and community activities. Some of our KNC incentives will be allocated to future partners. More can be considered depending on the success of the initial campaign and future grants.Proposal for token distribution:How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)60% for liquidity mining campaigns on selected token pairs to benefit Optimism liquidity providers. In addition, KyberSwap will utilize our own KNC funds to grow the Optimism community in SEA, as well as boost trading volume via trading contests and marketing initiatives.30% for strategic liquidity mining partnerships with top DeFi projects such as Lido, QiDAO, and Synthetix, which would help amplify the network effects on Optimism.10% for liquidity mining activities with future partners for the benefit of Optimism users.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.Over 3-6 months, with ample time for more users to be aware of the campaigns and bridge assets to Optimism. This also gives KyberSwap the flexibility to continually optimize our liquidity mining campaign and marketing efforts for the best possible outcome.We can work with shorter timelines if required and welcome recommendations from the Grants Council.Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.Revised on 24 Feb based onfeedback from the Grants Council.MilestonesMaintaining ourtop 3 positionin DEX trading volume on Optimism, while targeting the No.1 spot as we improve our capital efficiency.Source: DefillamaTotal cumulated KyberSwap trading volume on Optimism to be+$540M higher(to reach >= $1.3B) than when grant funds are received.

We can evaluate our performance with the Grants Council periodically e.g. after the first 3 months.If 50% of these milestones have not been reached by 3 months after receipt of half of the requested OP tokens, KyberSwap will submit a revised distribution plan to increase the odds of meeting the total goal.Performance SummaryAfter 6 months, on the completion of all milestones, KyberSwap will submit a summary of results to the Grants Council. This should be completed no later than 6 months after receipt of OP tokens, even if some milestones are incomplete.Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?KyberSwap has devised a strategy for sustainable liquidity mining on Optimism through:1. Active optimization of the liquidity pools and incentivesKyberDAO funds (already approved by KyberDAO earlier) would be used to seed liquidity on concentrated liquidity pools on Optimism. Depending on market conditions, the LP fee tier and price range of the pools can be customized and liquidity reallocated to ensure better rates and volume, which in turn increases organic yield APR% for LPs.OP and KNC incentives can be capped for each farm once the optimal TVL (to achieve best rates) is reached, to ensure more efficient use of incentives.2. New volume-based yield farming mechanismApart from the typical yield farming model based on the time period of an active liquidity position, KyberSwap introduced a new type of farm for tick-based AMMs (that have NFTs representing the liquidity position). This type of farm distributes incentives based on both the time period AND the target trading volume that the liquidity position is supporting. As such, liquidity incentives will be used efficiently for better performing farms that generate higher volume (and fees for LPs).When the OP incentives end, TVL and user adoption are expected to have already hit the required threshold to capture sufficient trading volume and fee APR%, thus retaining existing liquidity providers and attracting new ones.There will still be KNC incentives allocated for other activities on Optimism beyond just liquidity mining. KyberSwap plans to have a close, positive, and long-term collaboration with the Optimism team to bring more users, liquidity, and growth to the ecosystem.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)KyberSwap smart contracts have been audited by ChainSecurity and KNC and KyberDAO contracts by Hacken.ChainSecurity audit:https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/Hacken audit:https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/04042021_Kyber_SC_Audit_Report.pdfDeveloper Documentation:https://docs.kyberswap.comKyberSwap Elastic smart contracts:GitHub - KyberNetwork/ks-elastic-sc: Main smart contract for Pro-AMMSocial channelsTwitter: 235K followersTelegram: 14K membersDiscord: 7.9K membersForum: 580 membersYoutube: 3.5K subscribersFacebook: 23K followersReddit: 12.7K membersCoinGecko pagesKyberSwap:https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kyberswap-elastic-optimismKNC:https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kyber-network-crystalThank you for considering our proposal.

[FINAL] Spearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols Building on Optimism,"Proposed Mission: Spearbit + Immunefi Bug Bounty Program for Large Protocols on Optimism.Proposal Tier 42: PhoenixAs Spearbit, we qualify for the Phoenix Tier based on previous work done with the Optimism Foundation.Baseline grant amount: 100,000 OP% of total available Intent Budget: 10%Please check here if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your Mission and you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant: NoAlliance name: Spearbit + ImmunefiAlliance Leads:Spencer Macdonald, Co-Founder and CEO @ SpearbitMike Leffer, COO @ SpearbitHenry Shen, Senior AE @ ImmunefiContact info:mike@spearbit.comhen@immunefi.comL2 recipient address: TBDPlease list the members of your Alliance and link to any previous work:Spearbit is a distributed network of security experts providing security services to web3 clients. Our members include some of the most seasoned Security Researchers in the industry. We provide security audits, monitoring, advisory and incident response services for organizations like Optimism, OpenSea, Polygon, and Connext. More about our work with Optimism and other clients can be found on our website / portfolo.Immunefi is a web3 focused bug bounty platform that utilizes a network of 30k+ whitehat hackers for any type of blockchain project that utilizes smart contracts. Projects also have the ability to list bug bounties for more traditional SAAS frameworks such as their web/app architecture. Our client roster includes some of the most industry leading names like Polygon, Lido, RocketPool, SushiSwap, GMX, Arbitrum, etc. Refer to our website for additional information on client roster and previous work.Please explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:Technical decentralization, at its core, involves the distribution of control, authority, and operation across multiple independent entities. This avoids a single point of failure and prevents the system from being controlled by a single entity.Security Assurance for Decentralized Infrastructure: This program will ensure the security of decentralized infrastructure by incentivizing the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities. Given the interconnectedness of protocols in the DeFi ecosystem, vulnerabilities in protocols with large TVL can pose systemic risk, lead to multi-protocol exploits, and cripple the reputation of entire ecosystems. A bug bounty program aimed at the largest protocols can help mitigate such systemic risks, contributing to a more stable and resilient decentralized environment. This program will also allow large protocols building on Optimism to receive a wide variety of opinions and feedback on their protocol and smart contract code since Immunefi utilizes a community of 30K+ whitehat hackers. A wide variety of opinions and feedback will contribute to the security assurance for decentralized infrastructure since it allows projects to receive unbiased and new feedback.Distributed Accountability: Our proposal distributes the responsibility of network security to a broader group, thus decentralizing the accountability that would traditionally lie with a central authority or a small group of developers. It can also support the work of community teams like OP Labs by providing an additional layer of security review and feedback. This can enhance the quality and reliability of their development work, contributing to the overall health of the decentralized ecosystem.Enabling Bridge Decentralization: Secure apps are crucial for bridge decentralization, as they often serve as primary liquidity sources and integration points for cross-chain interactions. Ensuring the security of a major app, therefore, helps facilitate safer and more efficient cross-chain operations, contributing to the overall technical decentralization. Immunefi and Spearbit utilize a massive community of whitehat hackers and vetted Security Researchers with experience across various ecosystems, languages, and types of projects. This program will further contribute to bridge decentralization since it will help secure apps as apps seek cross-chain functionality.We believe that this program would represent a start in the direction of a community-led security effort, one where new protocols and users would have confidence in deploying their time and money.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Spearbit has an established track record in the field of auditing and security consulting in web3. With our network of Security Researchers, we can ensure high quality code reviews leveraging our community to maximize detection and prevention. Our previous work with the Optimism Foundation further attests to our capabilities in this area.Immunefi is a web3 focused bug bounty platform that protects over $60 billion in user funds. We work with many notable names across L1s, L2s, defi protocols such as LayerZero, Cronos Labs, Polygon, Arbitrum, Boba Network, GMX, SushiSwap, etc. in hosting bug bounties for their protocols. We host bug bounties for any type of blockchain project, regardless of coding language, ecosystem, or type or project (defi vs. creator economy). We utilize a community of over 30k whitehat hackers who use our platform to hunt for bugs within our clients’ protocols. Immunefi is well-suited in executing this mission given the wide variety of projects, languages, and ecosystems that we currently work with. Our whitehat hacker community does not discriminate against any type of project, allowing Optimism projects to receive a diverse set of opinions and feedback from various types of whitehat hackers all around the world.Please list a critical milestone: Achievement of comprehensive bug coverage in large protocols on Optimism.

For people to remain engaged long-term, we need to talk to them in their native language and with concepts they can understand. We want to help Optimism achieve that for Spanish because only 12% of people in LATAM speak English; this means there are more than 418 million people in LATAM that need crypto and could get a better education and exposure to the Optimistic Vision in the language they can understand. This is an enormous amount of people. To make things achievable, we’ll invest the grant to expand awareness in the solid Espacio Cripto community we have today. Our dedication to educating and empowering the Spanish-speaking community aligns perfectly with the mission of the Optimism Collective.Espacio Cripto will execute a series of impactful activities under the clusters of awareness, engagement, and loyalty by introducing a comprehensive strategy to promote the Optimistic Vision. These activities aim to significantly increase awareness, understanding, and long-term commitment to the Optimistic Vision within the Web3 community in Mexico and LATAM, attracting value-aligned users, builders, and partners passionate about the vision of public goods and regenerative finance. Our proposal is the following:Awareness: Promote the Optimistic Vision through strategic initiatives that reach our vast audience. Activities:Incorporating Optimism-related announcements in all our weekly news recap episodes, Navegando.Placing dedicated banners in every edition of our weekly news recap newsletter, reaching a wide subscriber base.Sharing informative and engaging carousel posts on Instagram every 15 days, highlighting the key aspects of Optimism.Posting a tweet thread every 15 days, providing valuable insights and updates about Optimism to our active Twitter community.Engagement: Foster curiosity and understanding of the Optimistic Vision. Activities:Delivering a monthly newsletter exclusively focused on Optimism, providing in-depth analysis, and highlighting significant developments.Producing an episode dedicated to exploring the Optimistic Vision, discussing its principles, and showcasing its potential impact.Creating an episode dedicated to Retro PGF projects, discussing their progress and role in the ecosystem.Organizing a digital meetup with the Optimism team and delegates, enabling interactive Q&A sessions and fostering direct engagement with the community.We’re starting a new research arm in Espacio Cripto, we’ll publish a detailed report about Optimism, the vision, roadmap, how the technology works, and any other relevant topic. This will be at least a month of work from our analyst team.Loyalty: Build a solid and dedicated community of Optimism supporters and incentivize contributors to the Optimistic Vision. Activities:Organizing a dedicated IRL meetup in Mexico City focused solely on Optimism, providing a platform for community members to connect, learn, and share ideas.Identifying and nurturing local talent to establish a dedicated Optimism delegate in Mexico, further strengthening the connection between the community and Optimism’s goals.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Espacio Cripto was started by me Abraham Cobos and Lalo Rios. Lalo and I met at a crypto conference in 2018; we started being friends on that day and kept in touch for the upcoming years. In August 2020, Lalo and I reconnected and started ideating around starting a new podcast; that’s when we began Espacio Cripto’s community. This project was born to create high-value crypto content in Spanish; we want to help people understand crypto most impartially and positively. We never speculate on prices and always try to keep a realistic view of this fantastic industry. We believe in the Espacio Cripto Education Triad: high-quality content, decentralization, and simplicity. Espacio Cripto is a community that brings people together to learn about crypto and web3 inclusively. Today we’re more than a podcast; we’re a healthy community of builders focused on spreading the culture of decentralization and onboarding as many people as possible to web3.Here are some of our achievements as a community:Our North Star: Espacio Cripto’s community grew significantly during the last months. We went from having 556 to 1,669 community members inTelegramin the previous year, a growth of 295%. This is an active group with an engagement of more than 25% (readers and writers).We went from having 51 episodes to 189 as of June 19, 2023. We produced more than 200 hours of educational content. We produce at least two episodes per week, an interview with a Spanish Speaker builder, and a weekly news recap. We think long term, our goal is to have at least 1,000 episodes. Smash that rate and subscribe button inSpotifyandApple PodcastsWe’ve got more than 115,000 downloads in the last year.According to our 2022 Spotify wrap, we were in the top 10 podcasts for +23,000 people, top 5 for 17,000 people, and top 1 for almost 6,000 people. We’re really proud of that impact.According to Spotify, we were the top technology podcast in Mexico for 198 days in 2022Our channels significantly impact the LATAM community and have grown a lot in the last year.Instagramfollowers: from 1,889 to 5,587, a growth of 296%Twitterfollowers: from 2,749 to 6,767, a growth of 246%Newsletter: from 489 to 1,180, a growth of 241%We have executed a monthly community meetup since February 2022; see the video of our last meetuphereWe execute virtual educational sessions at least each month. See the most recent onehereWe gave a scholarship to 9 community members to assist Devcon. The Ethereum Foundation helped us with the tickets, and we provided accommodation for the community.Here is our2023 pitch deck, where we explain our community focus and how we understand our audience.Success stories from our communityOne of the most important things in the web3 community is connecting with builders that are culturally aligned with Optimism, have the experience delivering the work, and have a community with real traction. We have real examples of community members that grew their knowledge about web3 with us, and now they’re active contributors to different projects. Here are the testimonials of some of our community members, 100% written by them:Web3 name:CryptoReuMDHow did you start in web3?: I started in December of 2020, a little bored about COVID-19 and all the bad stuff that was in every corner, and medicine was full of pain and misinformation (I’m a Reumathologist in my web0 job), then I started to look at crypto and all the innovation that was all around, so it became for me, a new way of learning about how the world works and how we can change everything inside it, building and teaching.What are your current roles in the industry?: Im a moderator of Espacio Cripto, Champion of the subDAO of Bankless in Spanish, Co-Founder of Ethereum Mexico, creator of Toloks in Merida, a node from Espacio Cripto in Yucatan and Lens Library Product CoFounder.What are the first things that come to mind when you hear “Espacio Cripto”?: Build and LearnHow Espacio Cripto’s community has helped you in your journey: Confidence and gave me all the tools and knowledge, but more than everything, friends, friends that are alike, kind, and always helping.Web3 name:brichisHow did I join Espacio Cripto and how was my web3 knowledge back then?Joining Espacio Cripto marked a shift in my web3 understanding. Originally researching basics like Bitcoin, a friend introduced me to varied web3 communities, suggesting Espacio Cripto as my first Telegram group. Prior to this, I was often confused, now, I understand almost everything when my web3 friends discuss.How do I contribute to web3 today and how Espacio Cripto has helped me get here I’m project manager at General Magic and Co-Founder of Ethereum Mexico. Espacio Cripto has been instrumental in my journey, offering me a platform to inspire others. They entrusted me with moderating EC’s Telegram Group and speaking at my first panel ever, thus expanding my impact. The community also opened doors to scholarship opportunities and introduced me to a network of like-minded peers. Here, I learned that success isn’t about bull markets; it’s about building for the future.#WinandHelpWinWeb3 name: Reneweb3https://twitter.com/rene__hdzHow did I join Espacio Cripto and how was my web3 knowledge back then? I started to learn about blockchain in the summer of 2021, I listened to Bitcoin years ago, but I need to learn more about the technology of BTC or blockchain. I listened toAbraham in a podcast called Mundo Futuroon January 2022, and it blew my mind. Until then, I haven’t fallen into the rabbit hole, but I started listening and learning about blockchain on “Espacio Cripto” podcats. I learned a lot here, and that’s when I fell into the rabbit hole. The topics of blockchain are too high-level and complex, but on this podcast, I learned a lot because they can explain this complex topic and transform it into simple ways to learn about web3.How do I contribute to web3 today and how Espacio Cripto has helped me get here? I’m an ambassador of Push Protocol for México and LATAM; I found this position because members of the community of Espacio Cripto shared it with me. The community on Espacio Cripto is the best community on the web3 ecosystem in Latin America. I collaborated with BanklessDAO in the SubDAO for Spanish-speaking countries called “Nación Bankless.” All we do in the present; definitely we can do thanks to the podcast of Espacio Cripto and the community.Special RecognitionWe want to recognize one of our most important contributors, AnaTech. Ana joined Espacio Cripto as the first full-time team member, and her attitude to learning and natural community nurturing made her grow quickly. Today Ana is a Community Manager at the Arbitrum Foundation, and our whole community is really proud of her. Here you canread her story, how Espacio Cripto and several other communities helped her in her journey.Web3 name:AnaTechHow did I join Espacio Cripto, and how was my web3 knowledge back then? Espacio Cripto was the first web3 community I’ve been part of and was the beginning of everything. Back then, I knew about Bitcoin and Ethereum but only the basic things. Before joining, everything was hard to understand, especially because finding reliable resources was challenging. Espacio Cripto is a vibrant and friendly community; whenever I had a question, someone was there to help me. Through Espacio Cripto, I met many cool and inspiring people.How do I contribute to web3 today, and how has Espacio Cripto helped me get here? I’m part of the Arbitrum Foundation, helping with community development to help scale Ethereum. Espacio Cripto was my starting point, where I found many friends and opportunities. Lalo and Abraham, the founders of Espacio Cripto, one of the most listened-to podcasts in Spanish about crypto in LATAM and the largest web3 community in Mexico, gave me the opportunity to create educational content in Spanish about Web3 and boost the community. At Espacio Cripto, I continued to share, learn, and gain new abilities and friends. I saw and helped many newcomers safely join the space and many new builders finding their path in the Web3 ecosystem over one and a half years.721×795 114 KBMilestonesAll our deliverables will be in Spanish to broaden the impact of the Optimism Vision.Publish host read add in all Navegando episodes in July, August, and September.Placing a dedicated banner with a CTA to the Optimism vision in all our Navegando newsletters in July, August, and September.Publishing at least 6 educational carousels/infographics about Optimism in our social networks (Instagram and Twitter).

"Education and Training on Conflict Management, with Gravity DAO","Hello everyone in the Optimism forum!In this thread, we’d like to host an open conversation around the planning, implementation, and follow-up of a series of live education and training spaces on trust creation and conflict management, to be facilitated by Gravity DAO, during season 4 of the Optimism Collective.–Gravity DAOis a project that carries the flag ofAlternative Dispute Resolution in decentralized communities. We think that both individuals and organizations can develop competencies to transform conflict into potential energy for self-reflection and evolution, and we focus on practices that support the parties to deal with their issues by engaging in proactive spaces to look for solutions via dialogue.Having clear processes to deal with multiple sources of conflict is a way to improve the awareness and implementation of social norms, and to care for the well-being of the organization by being able tohear and process the needs that arise.We are following the implementation of ourRFP bidto support the Code of Conduct enforcement process and we would like to propose alternatives to reduce governance overhead caused by conflict scaling into token voting instances without previous management mechanisms.We want to complement ourFree online course,with multiple live sessions (14+), to deliver a meaningful social skills boot camp that aims to:Help contributors incorporate conflict management into their everyday life: promoting a healthy environment for the organization.Identify a group of enthusiasts who can become Gravitons: agents for deep listening, mental health awareness, emotional support, de-escalation, and dispute administration inside the community.The live sessions would be1 hour long and be offered across two different time zones for diverse participation.The sessions will be recorded, and we’ll facilitate documentation of key challenges and learnings in a final report. The sessions can be hosted on multiple platforms and even when the main language used in our content is English, we can prepare some amount of sessions in at least 3 alternative spoken languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and French).We are still coordinating the details of the schedule and the facilitators of the lessons, butthe study plan should be communicated in this same thread soon,hoping to start executing it in the first weeks of August.We extend the invitation to join these trainings to all members of the Optimism collective, but especially to theSupport Nerds.The Gravity DAO team will become more visible in the following weeks, having Bianca (@BiancaGadelha), Nikola (@NikolaCreatrix), and myself (@juankbell) as the main contact points. We invite you to connect with us here in the forum or via ourDiscord serverfor any questions or requests. We will endeavor to respond to inquiries within 1 Labor Day.Hoping for a fruitful collaboration, this is our initial communication until further updates."

We need to find more ways to get OP in the hands of the right kinds of users and builders. Protocols and users with a strong understanding of Optimism’s ecosystem possess valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision-making within the governance process. Their expertise and knowledge would ensure that governance decisions are made with a deep understanding of their potential implications, and would help promote an effective, sustainable, and diverse governance structure.Velodrome will run a 10 to 12-week program that will delegate and distribute vested OP tokens to 1) newly onboarded, high-profile protocols that commit to take an active role in Optimism Governance and 2) users with demonstrated ecosystem alignment through token locks, such as veVELO locks, and active engagement in protocol governance.Protocols and veVELO holders have a strong alignment to Optimism’s success, deep understanding of the Optimism ecosystem, and overall advanced awareness of the crypto landscape.Velodrome is uniquely positioned to engage high-profile protocols and veVELO holders to take an active role in Governance, which would significantly boost the Governance Accessibility goals in the following ways:Effective Knowledge Sharing:Users with a strong understanding of Optimism can play a crucial role in facilitating better knowledge sharing among the community. By actively engaging with other participants and sharing their expertise, they can contribute to the development of more informed voters. This will enhance the overall understanding of Optimism governance and enable a diverse range of perspectives to participate meaningfully.Increased Votable Supply and Reduced Concentration of Voting Power:Allocating vested tokens to lockers and protocols, conditional their active participation in governance processes, will ensure wider token distribution and encourage broader diversity of viewpoints. This will dilute the concentration of voting power, promoting a more democratic and equitable governance structure.Fresh Perspective:Users with a strong alignment to Optimism but limited experience in Governance can provide feedback on the user interfaces and tools used for interacting with governance programs. By sharing their experiences and suggestions, they can help identify areas of improvement and advocate for user-friendly designs that enhance accessibility for all participants.Demonstrated Engagement:New protocols incentivizing on Velodrome and new veVelo lockers have recently made a significant investment in the Optimism ecosystem. They are primed to make a further investment in the success of that ecosystem through active participation in governance, especially when tied to vested incentives. New protocols will be able to be onboarded to governance immediately as a bridge to a future protocol delegation program allocation. New individual users are a captive audience we can connect immediately to resources and educational opportunities in OP governance. This will be one of the easiest to reach audiences compared to other outreach channels.Velodrome will accomplish the mission by providing an end-to-end governance onboarding experience for both protocols and veVelo lockers, including infrastructure to claim and delegate vested OP. We will leverage our comprehensive experience in vesting contract implementations for governance to develop a new contract standard - govNFT - that enables the vesting and distribution of OP tokens contained within a govNFT. This standard will offer customization options including:Vesting Time: Protocols will have the flexibility to specify the duration over which the tokens vest. They can set the timeline according to their requirements.Transferrability: Users will have the option to choose whether the vested tokens can be transferred to other addresses or remain non-transferrable, ensuring control over the token’s movement.Unlock Mechanics: Users will be able to decide whether the vested tokens unlock periodically over time or all at once after the vesting period expires. This feature provides flexibility and allows for strategic unlocking of tokens.Additionally, the team will develop a user-friendly dashboard that will allow govNFT holders to delegate their positions and conveniently track relevant information, such as the remaining vesting time.By implementing govNFTs, Optimism and associated protocols can incentivize and reward users with a long-term focus, ensuring the no-sale rule is enforced and contributing to a sustainable and stable ecosystem.We will make all of our implementations available for all Optimism protocols to use. Our progress milestones detail the process. Beyond the delegation we will have dedicated communication channels on Discord and Telegram to keep new delegates up to date on key voting cycles and participation opportunities.As we have done for our other grants, we will lead the way on grant use analytics and pioneer methods for tracking governance participation that can be used for our grant and other grants provided under this mission.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Velodrome’s combined experiences make us well prepared to execute on this Mission:Velodrome is the single largest protocol on Optimism and the largest DEX on Layer 2 EthereumVelodrome’s governance community is one of the most active and diverse in crypto, with 14,300 veVELO holders participating in Velodrome’s weekly voting epochsveVELO holders, by virtue of their long-term locks, are uniquely committed to the success of the broader the ecosystem. The average lock time for veVELO positions is 3.6 years, and veVELO participants include leading protocols such as Synthetix, Stargate, and LidoScreenshot 2023-06-21 at 11.08.251332×744 101 KBVelodrome has proven record of both educating and attracting new protocols to Optimism, successfully onboarding over 50 protocols since inception at a rate of approximately one new protocol per weekVelodrome has also been a continued partner in monitoring and analytics for grants, holding ourselves accountable to the metrics we lay outimage3344×1800 399 KBPlease list acritical milestone.
