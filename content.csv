It is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by the axiom of impact=profit ‚Äî the principle that positive impact to the Collective should be rewarded to the individual.Empowering values. Robust infrastructure. An economy where everyone thrives.The foundation for a more equitable digital economy is an interconnected network of blockchains built on a modular, open-source codebase.How is this going to be governed?The Optimism Collective and the Superchain take an experimental and agile approach to governance, relentlessly iterating towards a system which stands the test of time.The Collective‚Äôs model of digital democratic governance  consists of two houses: theToken Houseand theCitizens‚Äô House. These two houses form a bicameral governance system, with the two-house design is intended to help the Collective make better decisions, avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems, and have checks and balances.What is described here is an initial experiment. The specifics of this system will evolve as the Collective grows.What is the Token House?Governance of the Optimism Collective began with the launch of the OP token and the Token House.As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of governance proposals.In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote directly, or delegate their OP voting power to someone else.Learnhow to delegate your OP tokens. You can delegate to yourself, or anyone else!The Token House votes on the proposal types outlined in theOperating Manual. You can join the discussion by visiting theDelegates category.You can learn more in theToken House Onboarding Hub.What is the Citizens‚Äô House?The Citizens‚Äô House is a large-scale experiment in a reputation-based governance system (one member = one vote), and is primarily responsible forRetroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).Join the discussion by following theRetro Fundingcategory and theCitizenscategory.But what do they really do?You can find a more detailed breakdown of responsibilities in this diagram.Gov responsibilites (1)1920√ó927 54.3 KB","The Optimism Collective, a novel digital democratic governance model, unites communities, companies, and citizens under the ""impact=profit"" principle.

Get  Started üå±,Working Constitution of the Optimism Collective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55,"The Optimism Collective is a large-scale experiment in decentralized governance. OurVisionis to sustainably fund those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond. This Working Constitution enshrines governing provisions and principles that, we hope, are calibrated to the ambition of this Vision. It lays the foundation for a fair, democratic model of decentralized governance that‚Äôs built to last._____________1.  This is a ‚ÄúWorking‚Äù Constitution.It is exceedingly unlikely that a fixed model of governing the Optimism Collective, defined at the outset of this experiment, can appropriately navigate the Collective‚Äôs future challenges. The problem space is too large. So we start from humility, beginning with a Working Constitution that is:A commitment to experimentation.In its lifetime, the Collective will undertake a series of governance experiments. These experiments should help the Collective understand the balance and power dynamics within its ecosystem, and allow the Collective to define itself, evolve, and grow iteratively over time.A transitory document.The Working Constitution will remain in effectno more than four yearsfrom the date of its adoption. After that, authority over governance will be ceded to a permanent Bedrock Constitution (that incorporates the lessons of the Collective‚Äôs prior governance experiments).2.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.The governing structure of the Collective must balance short-term incentives with its long-term Vision. Too often today, simple token-based governance systems deteriorate due to misaligned incentives or excessive consolidation of power. The Optimism Collective will implement structural mechanisms to counteract those shortcomings, beginning with abicameral governance systemthat checks and balances the power of OP Holders and OP Citizens.3.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.The Optimism Foundation is a Cayman Islands organization responsible for guiding the growth and development of the Optimism Collective. Acting through its Board of Directors, the Foundation may:Facilitate the administration of Collective governance;Allocate treasury assets to fund public goods, incentivize participants in the Optimism ecosystem, or otherwise further its (and the Collective‚Äôs) purpose;Amend this Working Constitution; andTake other actions that are conducive to its stewardship role.The Foundation will undertake all these responsibilities in a manner that is consistent with the mission of the Collective, and with a view towards increasingly decentralizing its role over time.4. Rights of OP Citizens and OP Holders.Subject to the founding legal documents of the Optimism Foundation and the procedures outlined in the Collective‚Äôs Operating Manual:Future OP Citizens may:Allocate Retroactive Public Goods Funding; andExercise such additional rights as are provided to OP Citizens over time.OP Holders may:Remove a director of the Optimism Foundation; andVeto changes to the founding documents of the Optimism Foundation, if those changes would reduce the rights of OP Holders in a material way.5.  Interpretation.In interpreting the scope, authority, and meaning of the provisions of this Working Constitution, the following guiding principles apply:Governance minimization.Minimal governance is at the heart of the Optimism Collective. When multiple proposals achieve a similar outcome, the Collective should prefer the proposal with the least overhead. We strive to boil down governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. We believe this is key to creating the fertile soil for permissionless innovation.Forking.The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. It‚Äôs expected and encouraged that if the governance of the Optimism Collective is captured, members of the Collective fork the system and reinstate a new Collective which better serves the people. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative.Anti-plutocracy.Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance is a risk to the health and effectiveness of the Collective, and must be balanced with Citizenship.impact=profit.The primary function of the Collective is to minimize the discrepancy between collective impact and individual profit. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. We harm ourselves when we do not adequately, fairly, and consistently reward positive impact.6.Always.Stay Optimistic","The Optimism Collective's Working Constitution outlines a four-year experiment in decentralized governance, aiming to sustainably fund public goods.  It establishes a bicameral system balancing OP Citizens and OP Holders, mitigating risks of power consolidation.  The Optimism Foundation stewards the Collective, gradually decentralizing its role.  The Constitution prioritizes minimal governance, emphasizing the right to fork, resisting plutocracy, and aligning individual profit with collective impact.  This iterative approach, via experimentation, will inform a permanent constitution.

Get  Started üå±,Optimist Expectations,https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241,"Optimist ExpectationsOptimists (all delegates, Citizens, and grant recipients) are expected to abide by the below expectations.If a delegate does not abide by these expectations, their delegators should consider re-delegating to a delegate who does abide by them. You can see how to delegate, and redelegate, your tokenshere.Ultimately, enforcement of Citizen expectations will occur in the Citizenship Criteria. In the meantime, Citizen expectations will be socially enforced and incorporated into incentive and voting design. As these mechanisms are developed over time, the Foundation may still play a temporary role in enforcement mechanisms (such as badge removal). The ability of the Foundation to implement any enforcement actions will be specified at the start of each round, and linked under the Self-Dealing section below, given the unique considerations of distinct round designs.These expectations will not cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. We ask that Optimists please act in accordance with the spirit of these Expectations and refrain from exploiting loopholes that may exist.While you may alert delegators to violation of these expectations, anyone using Optimism community spaces is subject to theRules of Engagement.Values AlignmentAll Optimists should uphold theCollective ValuesNo Self-DealingOptimists must avoid conflicts of interest where possible and mitigate their impact when not possible. We recommend over-communicating and disclosing potential conflicts of interest even when they do not warrant abstaining from a vote.Any actual or reasonably anticipated conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing and prominently displayed ahead of any voting (i.e. when submitting delegate commitments, when approving proposal drafts, when running for an elected position, when making public recommendations, when voting in Rounds etc.).Optimists are prohibited from approving and voting on their own proposals.Delegates may not vote solely for their own candidacy in an election. In the case of approval/ranked choice elections, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positionsExample: I can vote for my own candidacy on the Growth Experiments committee, so long as I also cast 4 additional votes (a total of 5 votes, as there are 5 open positions on the sub-committee.)Badgeholders must not vote for organizations where they expect any portion of funds to flow to them or any projects from which they derive income.InclusivityDebate and disagreement can be healthy and assist in the growth of the Collective. However, Optimists should be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences and show empathy towards community members.Optimist communications relating to their role in the Collective should be transparent and public. Communication in public is favored over DMs/private communication, whenever possible.Extreme CivilityOptimists should not make personal attacks on the opinions or merits of proposal authors or any other party engaging in governance activity. Optimists should not make unsubstantiated claims to advocate for or against any proposal or proposal author. Optimists may make inquiries to proposal authors to validate or collect information. We encourage the use of designated channels and spaces for feedback, minimizing social media or public spaces to host conversations that can damage the goodwill of the Collective. Reporting grant misusage is permitted and the process to do so is defined here (details coming soon!)Optimists should provide constructive feedback supported by high quality and well researched arguments.Good Faith and Best InterestOptimists should operate in a way and vote in accordance with what they believe is in the best interests of the Optimism Collective.Due Care and AttentionOptimists should maintain a working knowledge of developments at Optimism and in the wider cryptocurrency space.Optimists should make a professional review, minimizing bias, of each proposal prior to voting. Delegates that are unable to review proposals should abstain from voting.Optimists are encouraged to maximize their voting participation rate, to the best of their ability.Optimists are encouraged to shape the development of Optimism‚Äôs governance structure by providing constructive feedback during Reflection Periods.AttributionMaker‚ÄôsRecognized Delegate Code of ConductFriends with Benefits‚ÄôCode of ConductPython‚ÄôsDiscord Code of ConductGitcoin‚ÄôsCode of ConductRadicle‚ÄôsCode of Conduct","Optimism Collective members (Optimists) must uphold collective values, avoid conflicts of interest (disclosing any in writing), and refrain from self-dealing (e.g., voting solely for their own proposals).  Inclusivity, extreme civility, and constructive feedback are paramount.  Optimists should act in the Collective's best interest, maintaining knowledge of Optimism and wider cryptocurrency developments, and voting thoughtfully.  Enforcement mechanisms are evolving, with social enforcement currently primary.  Non-compliance may result in re-delegation or other consequences outlined in specific round designs and community guidelines.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,[grant update] bleu Tech Partner of OP Native Projects,https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-update-bleu-tech-partner-of-op-native-projects/8639,"Dear Optimism Community,We want to provide a brief update on our ‚ÄúTech Partner of OP Native Projects‚Äù grant approved in Season 5 and seek your input on our path forward.BackgroundOur grant aims to offer 1,000 hours of technical support (UI/UX, backend, frontend, data analysis, launch support) to Optimism ecosystem projects. We‚Äôre eager to start but have encountered a challenge with project selection.In the first version of the proposal, we proposed to handle vetting projects ourselves. During the review process, the reviewers asked for a change so that the Grants Council does the selection instead (seeapproved proposal), which got incorporated into our final grant scope. Despite the grant‚Äôs approval, though, we haven‚Äôt received any project assignments from the Grants Council so far.We understand that the Grants Council is currently managing a high workload, which may have contributed to the delay in project assignments. Given this situation, we reached out to@gonna.ethto discuss potential solutions, and he proposed.Proposed ApproachAfter discussing with@gonna.eth, he proposed an alternative that doesn‚Äôt require the Grants Council‚Äôs direct involvement given their current workload:50% of our services to existing grantees50% to projects we select independently, based off the selection criteria belowWe like this suggestion because it potentially allows us to start working promptly, supporting both vetted grantees and new initiatives without additional Grants Council intervention.ConsiderationsSelecting and negotiating with projects will require time that wasn‚Äôt accounted for in the original grant. We propose deducting these hours from the total grant hours to ensure we‚Äôre being fair with our time.We recognize that this approach represents a change from the approved grant scope. We want to ensure this change aligns with the community‚Äôs expectations and Optimism‚Äôs governance standards, hence why this forum post.The 50/50 split is not based on any specific reason. We‚Äôre open to amending the split in favor of either part down the line upon community feedback and also our own perception from watching the process unfold.Selection CriteriaFor the projects we select independently, we propose focusing on open-source projects building on Optimism. Our criteria will include:Open-source nature of the projectRelevance to the Optimism ecosystemPotential impact and innovationTechnical feasibility and need for our expertiseOur proposal is to announce selected projects every month, allowing the community to provide feedback or intervene if necessary.What We Need From YouWe‚Äôre seeking community feedback on:The 50/50 split between grantees and independently selected projectsOur proposed selection criteria for independent projectsAny other concerns we should addressNext StepsReview the community feedback in this post over the next weekDo a follow-up post summarizing key points and our planned actionsShare list of potential grantees that could benefit from our services by next MondayFinally, if you‚Äôre building on Optimism and think our services could be useful, please reach out to us on Telegram at rpunktj or comment in this thread.We‚Äôre looking forward to rolling up our sleeves and getting to work!","An Optimism grant to provide 1000 hours of technical support to ecosystem projects faces delays due to project selection bottlenecks.  The initial plan for the grant council to select projects has stalled.  A proposed solution involves a 50/50 split: supporting existing grantees and independently selecting new open-source Optimism projects based on specific criteria.  Community feedback is sought on this revised approach, the project selection criteria, and potential concerns before proceeding.  The team will share a list of potential grantees and summarize community feedback next week.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,Season 7: Governance Fund Missions,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-governance-fund-missions/9300,"Special thanks to members of theFeedback Commissionfor discussion and review.In Season 7, Governance Fund Missions will focus on contributions, across the Superchain, that make progress towards success metrics. That means only projects that meet eligibility criteria ensuring their contributions are measurable onchain will be supported in Season 7. While that means a sub-set of contributions will not be rewarded, we must first refine and perfect the ability to reward an important set of contributions before expanding our capabilities to measure additional contributions. The entire Collective will be focused on measurable, on-chain contributions in Season 7, allowing us to better assess and compare token allocation methods.Grants Council MissionExpected impact on the Intent:The Grants Council makes grants, on behalf of the Token House, in an effort to make progress towards the Intent. In Season 7, all Governance Fund missions will work towards the below success metrics, which the Foundation believes will create progress towards the Intent:Increase Superchain TVL (denominated in ETH)Increase Stablecoin TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Wrapped Asset TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Bridged Asset TVL across the SuperchainWhy these metrics?Launching interoperability will be a Season-long project. In advance of interop going live on the Superchain ‚Äì and allowing the Collective to focus on driving the cross-chain asset transfer metric mentioned in the intent ‚Äì these TVL-related metrics will help prepare the Superchain for robust adoption of interoperability once it goes live.Total budget:10M OP from the Governance FundPlease note this is relative to 18M in Season 6. However, 12M of the 18M was reserved for a specific Superchain grants program, which distributed large grants to enable OP Chains to run their own grants programs as the Grants Council was otherwise constrained to supporting applications on OP Mainnet. This Season, grants can be made across eligible chains based on their ability to move TVL metrics, so there isn‚Äôt a need for a dedicated portion to enable OP Chains to run their own grants program. That means the portion the Grants Council has full discretion over actually increased by +4M (from 6M to support applications in Season 6.) The Grants Council Budget was 9M OP in Season 5.Eligibility:Projects will need to have, or plan to have, onchain contracts deployed on eligible OP Chains and may be subject to additional eligibility criteria similar to that outlinedhere. Additionally, project participation in the market may be subject to additional criteria determined by the Grants Council. The eligibility criteria for OP Chains will be shared in January; you can expect roughly 10 chains to be eligible.Selection Algorithm:It is at the discretion of the Grants Council to determine their own selection algorithm. Selection algorithms (which have taken the form of public rubrics in the past), must be made public on the forum before the first round of selection takes place.Evaluation Algorithm:Projects selected by the Grants Council will be assessed, based on their ability to generate contribution towards the success metrics defined above, by OP Labs or Open Source Observer on the measurement date.Measured Outcomes:Increase Superchain TVL (denominated in ETH)Increase Stablecoin TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Wrapped Asset TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Bridged Asset TVL across the SuperchainMeasurement Date:End of Season 7Decision Market MissionIn 2025, Optimism is partnering with Butter and Uniswap Foundation totest the efficacy of decision markets in relation to alternative methods for predictive token allocation decisions, such as a council structure.You can read more about this collaborative experimenthere. We will publish additional details about this experiment in the coming months.To recap, Season 7 has one intent:A set ofinteroperableStage 1 chains doing $250m per month in cross-chain asset transfers.Expected impact on the Intent:As we understand how to improve decisions about which grants drive strategic outcomes, we are more likely we are to achieve our Intents. In Season 7, all Governance Fund missions will work towards the below success metrics, which the Foundation believes will create progress towards the Intent:Increase Superchain TVLIncrease Stablecoin TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Wrapped Asset TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Bridged Asset TVL across the SuperchainWhy these metrics?Launching interoperability will be a Season-long project. In advance of interop going live on the Superchain ‚Äì and allowing the Collective to focus on driving the cross-chain asset transfer metric mentioned in the intent ‚Äì these TVL-related metrics will help prepare the Superchain for robust adoption of interoperability once it goes live.Total budget:500k OP from the Governance FundEligibility:There are two dimensions of permissionless eligibility: 1)forecasterswho participate by betting in the market and 2)projectsthat have set up pools in the market.Forecasters:Participation in the prediction market will be permissionless ‚Äî any non U.S. resident can sign up and ‚Äúplay.‚Äù Forecasters may be required to disclose conflicts of interest.Projects:Projects will need to have, or plan to have, onchain contracts deployed on eligible OP Chains and may be subject to additional eligibility criteria similar to that outlinedhere. Additionally, project participation in the market may be subject to additional criteria required to apply to the Grants Council. The eligibility criteria for OP Chains will be shared in January; you can expect roughly 10 chains to be eligible.Selection Algorithm:The decision market serves as the selection algorithm itself, serving as a public indication about the projects that the market believes should receive grants.Evaluation Algorithm:Projects selected by the decision market will be assessed, based on their ability to generate contribution towards the success metrics defined above, by OP Labs or Open Source Observer on the measurement date.Measured Outcomes:Increase Superchain TVLIncrease Stablecoin TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Wrapped Asset TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Bridged Asset TVL across the SuperchainMeasurement Date:End of Season 7, and quarterly thereafter.Additional details about related to the above Mission will be published at a future date.","Optimism's Season 7 Governance Fund ($10M OP) prioritizes on-chain, measurable contributions to increase Superchain TVL (ETH, stablecoins, wrapped & bridged assets).  This refines grant allocation, unlike Season 6's dispersed approach.  A parallel $500k experiment with Butter and Uniswap Foundation uses decision markets to predict grant recipients, aiming to improve strategic outcome selection.  Eligibility criteria, focusing on roughly 10 OP chains, will be detailed in January.  Success will be measured at Season's end based on the defined TVL increases.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,Season 6 Grants Council Final and Retrospective Report,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-grants-council-final-and-retrospective-report/9302,"I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Foundation and all the Grants Council members for their hard work and dedication this season. A special mention goes to@Bunnic, who, despite not being an elected member, stepped up to support me in operations. His outstanding work ensured everything ran smoothly, and he did so without incurring additional expenses to the governance fund, as I allocated a portion of the lead budget to him. Thank you, Bunnic, and the entire team, for making this season a success!Assessment of Impact KPIsBuilder Experience KPIs:NPS of finalists > 9/10: Achieved an impressive score of 91.7, demonstrating high satisfaction among finalists and meeting the KPI.Quality applicants unable to be supported (<5%): Out of 344 total applications, only 3 required Foundation intervention. This represents less than 1%, successfully meeting the KPI.Grant Performance KPIs:Intent 1: Commit 5% increase in votable supply:Granted 289,999 OP, 90% of which is locked for one year. Quality projects like Herotudus, Aragon, and Gitcoin provide confidence in achieving a 5% increase in votable supply over the next 12 months.Intent 3: Increase active developers by 150:Metrics introduced in Season 6 (e.g., active addresses, gas fees generated) will track progress. With 122 applications approved, achieving this milestone seems realistic, pending reports.Launch 5 OP Chain grant programs:Over 15 grant programs were approved, significantly exceeding the target.Clawbacks for milestone failures <5%:Clawbacks occur in subsequent seasons. Historically, clawbacks have been below 5%, and this season is expected to follow suit.Key numbersApplications:Total Apps: 344Total Apps Passed to Prelim: 290Total Apps Passed to Final: 258Total Apps Approved: 122S6 BudgetIntent 1: 500,000 OPIntent 3A: 6,000,000 OPIntent 3B: 12,000,000 OPS6 AllocationsIntent 1: 289,999 OPIntent 3A: 4,060,750 OP + 42.426 OP¬πIntent 3B: 11,950,000 OP¬πAmendment: We had a clerical error and the project should not be penalized for it. The GC used 42.426 OP from the unallocated budget at the end of the season that otherwise would have been sent back to the gov fund to correct the mistake.Total returned to the Gov Fund: 2,156,825 OPMajor Problems and Proposed Solutions1. Tight Timeline Between Elections and Grant SubmissionsProblem: The rushed transition from nominee elections to the start of the first Cycle left inadequate time for preparing forms, rubrics, and QA processes. This resulted in errors that had to be fixed manually during live operations, increasing stress and inefficiencies.Solution: Establish a task force immediately in grants council S7 budget approval to handle forms and rubric creation, ensuring enough time for feedback and QA.2. Scoped Mission Requests (MRs)Problem: While scoped MRs improved the quality of applications, they excluded potential applicants whose projects didn‚Äôt align with the MR scope. This created frustration and reduced overall participation in creative solutions.Solution: Introduce a ‚ÄúGeneral Innovation‚Äù MR to allow projects that don‚Äôt fit scoped MRs but still align with ecosystem goals.3. Budget Stagnation for Certain MRsProblem: Some approved MRs had no strong applicants throughout the season, leading to unused OP. We observe 8 MRs for a total of 600.000 OP unused.Solution: Introduce a budget reallocation mechanism independent from TH. If an MR remains inactive for a specific period, its budget can be reassigned to active MRs like audits if the demand is there.4. Audit ChallengesProblem: The demand for audits exceeded available funding by nearly 1M OP. Additionally, the audit review process required significant time and effort, creating bottlenecks.Solution: Position audit grants as partial subsidies rather than full funding to manage expectations and stretch the budget further. Adjust future budgets to better accommodate audit demand based on historical data.S7 design suggestion: The Grants Council can handle submission and operations and coordinate reviews and scoring with DAB. (no more audits subcommittee)5. Developer Awareness GapProblem: Many developers were unaware of the Grants Council or how to engage with the program. This likely limited the number of high-quality applicants, particularly in newer or underserved segments of the ecosystem.Solution: Recruit a business development professional to increase awareness and engagement with the Grants Council. Promote the program through developer-focused events, partnerships, and direct outreach.6. Different Objectives Across Mission RequestsProblem: The presence of over 22 mission requests with different objectives caused confusion for applicants, many of whom found it difficult to navigate the process or identify the right MR for their projects.Solution: Streamline and unify MR objectives, consolidating them into broader, measurable intents. Provide clearer communication and guidance to applicants to help them understand how their projects align with these objectives.Lack of Unified Intent Across Key Actors:Problem: One of the most significant challenges was the misalignment of intents and priorities between multiple actors, including OP Labs, the Foundation, and the Collective. Each actor had slightly different visions and expectations, making it difficult to establish clear, cohesive objectives. This lack of unified intent not only created confusion in defining KPIs but also introduced inefficiencies in coordinating efforts, particularly when it came to evaluating and prioritizing grants. As a result, some opportunities were either delayed or missed entirely, and there was additional friction in aligning budget allocation strategies.Solution: Facilitate a pre-season alignment workshop with representatives from OP Labs, the Foundation, and the Collective to ensure shared goals and priorities. Clearly define and document common objectives in a collaborative charter that can guide the Grants Council throughout the season. Establish regular cross-actor check-ins to assess progress toward these unified goals and address discrepancies before they escalate.Improvements to the Grants Council for Next Season1. Include Business Development (BD) as a Core Component2. Streamline the Mission Request ProcessProblem: Mission Requests (MRs) were overly complex, leading to confusion among applicants and some inefficiencies within the council.Improvement:Prepare a larger pool of predesigned, high-quality MRs before the season starts, with clear goals and guidelines for applicants.Introduce a hybrid MR model where budgets can be either fully allocated for applicants or partially available for standard initiatives aligned to S7 Intent.Simplify the application process further to make it more intuitive for participants, particularly for protocols unfamiliar with governance.3. Incorporate a Tiered Reviewer SystemProblem: Reviewer expertise varied, leading to potential mismatches in the evaluation of applications.Possible Improvement:Establish Tier 1 reviewers (experts) for highly technical evaluations and Tier 2 reviewers (generalists) for broader application reviews.Focus expertise on Mission Requests requiring deep technical understanding, such as DeFi or Superchain integrations.4. Reduce the Number of Team MembersProblem: Leading 18 members was highly complex and required major discipline to keep processes running smoothly, often stretching coordination and management capacity.Improvement: Reduce the number of Grants Council members to a more manageable size, allowing for streamlined operations, clearer communication, and better accountability. A smaller team can focus on specialized roles, such as business development, mission request design, and grant evaluation, without overcomplicating workflows.5. Elect Operations Roles as a Single TeamProblem: Currently, lead and operational roles are elected separately, which can lead to misaligned responsibilities and inefficiencies in ensuring the Grants Council runs smoothly.Improvement: The Grants Council budget should include the election of a unified operations team, consisting of a Lead, an Operations Coordinator, and a Milestone and Metrics Lead if these roles are part of the council. These roles should be elected as one team in the budget, with a shared mandate to ensure proper functionality and accountability for the Grants Council. Reviewers can still be elected by the Token House, but the operational team needs cohesive leadership to manage the council effectively.Improvements to the Grants Council mandateProblem: The lack of a clear and simple metric for the Grants Council mandate made it challenging to align efforts and measure success effectively. Ambiguous goals, such as ‚Äúdriving developers to the ecosystem,‚Äù were difficult to quantify and rally the team behind.Improvement: Define a single, measurable, and on-chain metric for the Grants Council mandate. This metric should provide a clear path for decision-making and success evaluation, such as the number of active contracts deployed, unique developer addresses interacting with Optimism, or cumulative gas fees generated by funded projects. This will focus the council‚Äôs efforts and ensure alignment across all members.","The Optimism Grants Council's Season 6 successfully exceeded key performance indicators (KPIs), including high finalist satisfaction (NPS 91.7%) and a minimal need for Foundation intervention (under 1%).  Significant funding was allocated (over $11 million in OP), exceeding the target number of grant programs.  Challenges included a tight timeline, scoped mission requests limiting applicant pool, budget stagnation in some areas, and high audit demand.  Solutions proposed for Season 7 involve a task force for improved processes, a ""General Innovation"" mission request, budget reallocation mechanisms, partial audit subsidies,  business development efforts to increase developer awareness, streamlined mission requests, a tiered reviewer system, and a reduced, more efficient council structure with unified operational roles.  A pre-season alignment workshop is recommended to ensure unified objectives across stakeholders.

The Lead may propose a budget that contains variable rewards for members, provided that the evaluation algorithm for rewards is approved by a simple majority of members by the end of the first month of the term.IterationThe canonical version of Charters for persistent structures will be published to GitHub. Any material updates to the Charter will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.It should finally be reiterated that the role of all structures are intended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its functionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed by other means. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective to reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full and final dissolution of any non-essential structures.","This charter establishes the Optimism Collective's Season 7 Milestones and Metrics (M&M) Council, responsible for measuring grant milestone completion and impact.  A four-person council (lead and three reviewers) will oversee grant disbursement, ensuring compliance and transparency.  The council utilizes a multi-sig wallet and collaborates with the Grants Council and Optimism Foundation.  Responsibilities include tracking milestones, validating reports, and managing funds, with emergency procedures for fraud or significant deviations.  Council members require expertise in data analysis and commitment to objectivity.  The charter details member responsibilities, resignation procedures, and accountability measures, aiming for eventual dissolution as governance matures.

This MR ties in with the four Season 6 RWA MRs posted by GFX Labs, so it will reuse multiple of the same goals and criteria.While assessing current and potential applicants for[Mission Request] Optimism Dominance in Yield-Bearing Assets (3 of 4), we discovered that DEX liquidity was needed more than lending market integrations for multiple of the whitelisted RWAs, so we intend to address that issue here by promoting DEX integrations and incentivization for RWAs/other yield-bearing assets coming to Optimism.S6IntentIntent 3AProposing Delegate/CitizenAnthias LabsTotal grant amount500,000 OP - This is to be distributed to DEXes that will then distribute to users for the purpose of bridging assets and depositing them into whitelisted DeFi protocols. In the event the rewards budget is exhausted before the end of the period, the rewards will be provided on a first-in-first-out basis. The Grants Council, at its discretion, may choose to limit the amount of OP rewards that can accrue to a single whitelisted asset to avoid crowding out of other assets.Should this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants?MultipleHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?This incentive program is intended to encourage users to migrate yield-bearing capital assets onto Optimism. The presence of such assets organically increases the TVL secured by Optimism over time as yield accrues to those assets, and they tend to be economically productive assets that encourage long term Optimism alignment.

An enduring focal point for developers, projects seeking products or talent, and funders could easily provide a currently lacking funnel for grassroots developer interest.Although there have been several hackathons related to Optimism‚Äîboth sponsored and not sponsored‚Äîthere has as yet not been a major, central hackathon explicitly geared toward the Superchain. There is a forthcoming one in August, co-led by EthGlobal, but there are opportunities to have more, co-led by other players in the space.Base recently announced a high-profile hackathon spotlighting some impressive sponsors, such asStripe and Shopify, which has attractedconsiderable support from builders. We can do the same.What is required to execute this Mission Request?All of the following:An applicant that is highly reputable and that has prior experience with hackathonsThis hackathon may be in-person or virtual; however, priority is given to in-person programs, especially those that offer some means of administering in-person or travel arrangements.A credible commitment to growing maximum awareness of the hackathonOpenness to all participating superchainsProposals should outline the basic logistics of this hackathon: how developers are selected, roughly how long the hackathon will take, judging structure, how sponsorships are handled, etc. Proposers with previous experience with hackathons should share details on their experience and results.How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?MilestonesDevelopment of more detailed logistics planCommunication of announcement and updates on pending hackathonSigned up applicantsSigned up sponsorsMetrics:Number of applicantsNumber of participating projectsAmount of prize funds raisedNumber of sponsorsCommitted funding and fundersImpactNumber of projects live six months from hackathonNumber of active developers new to SuperchainOpen-source tooling resulting from hackathon:Has anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?NoWhich metric will the success of this Mission Request be evaluated against?The North star metric against which this Mission Request should be evaluated is thetotal amount of gas fees generated from the grantee‚Äôs contracts, because this Mission Request sets out to increase the aggregate demand for blockspace on the Superchain through a larger program. The total gas fees generated from this program act as a healthy indicator of its combined downstream performance. This metric was suggested by the Foundation and approved by the Grants Council.","This $50,000 grant funds a hackathon to attract developers to the Superchain.  The goal is to create a central, high-profile event (potentially in-person)  to foster innovation and recruitment.  A reputable applicant with hackathon experience is needed.  Success will be measured by the number of participating projects, developers (new to Superchain), sponsors, and ultimately, the total gas fees generated from resulting contracts on the Superchain.  This builds upon existing Optimism-related hackathons but aims for a larger, more focused Superchain-specific event.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,[Mission Request] - Crosschain alert monitoring,https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-crosschain-alert-monitoring/8850,"Delegate Mission Request Summary:Products built on top of Interop require alerting and monitoring for messages/transactions leaving their canonical chain. This is critical if we want to approach serious teams interested in products requiring superior functionality, security, and UX to build crosschain protocols servicing the Superchains.S6Intent 42:Please list the Intent your Request aligns with hereProposing Delegate/Citizen:Delegate name/pseudonym, linked to delegate profileTotal grant amount:60k OPShould this Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:Up to two for nowHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?The guiding hypothesis is that just like Fault Proofs are a bottleneck for capital to onboard onto Superchain, fully functional interop is a bottleneck for developers to generate true crosschain projects. OP Mainnet has lacked a guiding identity since the proliferation of new chains on Superchain, but one area will forever reside within OP-owned chains: protocols and tokens that are inherently crosschain, those that require a neutral positioning to fully service the Superchain. This tooling is a step in that direction.In effect, this is a classic dev experience request. Currently such tooling is either very expensive, limited in functionality, or limited in chain coverage. Developers will enjoy the peace of mind and added value when adopting OP Stack / Superchain for their new products, and they will be more enabled to enhance crosschain services.What is required to execute this Mission Request?Tools that help teams track the following:Whether interop messaging is down or pausedWhether interop messages have delays or are suffering degraded performanceWhether interop messages didn‚Äôt fulfill and require active interventionCore metricslatency between sender/receiver chainsgas usage of the sender/receiver, ideally aggregated at a project/layer level natively (i.e., we should not rely on external tools that might refuse or delay the onboarding/indexing of new chains)Health alertsWhether an event is issued and didn‚Äôt arriveWhether an event should not have occurredWhether an event is expectedHow should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?Milestones:If an adapted product that already exists, milestones should track launch and outreach to users.Metrics:Metrics should track the performance of the product, type I and II errors in reporting relative to accurately tracked events, and adjustments in response to user / governance requests.Number of active developer addresses interacting with grantee‚Äôs contracts (may have to be adapted depending on how onchain a product will be)Impact:Number of protocols making active use of this productNew Superchain protocols using this product within a month of LaunchHas anyone other than the proposer contributed to this Mission Request?Stas from Velodrome contributed to this. It‚Äôs a clear ask from a user of Superchain.","This proposal requests 60k OP to fund development (up to two applicants) of monitoring and alerting tools for Interoperability (Interop) messaging on the Optimism Superchain.  The tools will track message status, performance (latency, gas usage), and health, addressing a critical developer experience gap.  This improves cross-chain protocol development by overcoming current limitations in existing, expensive, or insufficient solutions.  Success will be measured by active developer usage, new protocol adoption, and tool performance metrics, including error rates and responsiveness.  Velodrome's Stas supports this request, highlighting user demand.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,Reallocating Pre-Approved And Unused Grants - Rubicon Phase 0 + Phase 1,https://gov.optimism.io/t/reallocating-pre-approved-and-unused-grants-rubicon-phase-0-phase-1/9111,"SummaryWe propose reallocating ~110,000 OP tokensfrom previously approved butunusedsources into the Rubicon Grants Fund. This includes60,000 OP from Phase 1, which was initially allocated for Rubicon Pools V2 (a product we no longer plan to pursue - in fact, Pools v1 was entirely deprecated well over a year ago), and over50,000 OP in unclaimed rewardsfrom Rubicon‚Äôs early user airdrop (Phase 0), which took place over 792 days ago. By sweeping these idle OP tokens into the already-approved and utilized Grants Fund, we will support further development of the Rubicon protocol, including the launch of our RUBI token, which will be airdropped to active Optimism users.Rationale for ReallocationUnclaimed Airdrop Rewards (50,000+ OP):The early user airdrop was distributed 792 days ago to over 2,700 unique users. As of now, over 50,000 OP tokens remain unclaimed. Given the significant time elapsed, it is reasonable to reallocate these unclaimed rewards to a more active use case: theRubicon Grants Program. This will ensure that these tokens are put to work, directly funding builders and projects that contribute to Rubicon and the Optimism ecosystem.Phase 1 Allocation for Rubicon Pools V2 (60,000 OP):The original Phase 1 grant allocated 60,000 OP to liquidity pools forRubicon Pools V2, a product that we have since decided not to pursue. Rather than leaving this allocation unutilized, we propose sweeping it into theGrants Fund, where it can provide direct value to builders and projects developing on Rubicon.Why Reallocate to the Grants Program?By sweeping theseidle OP tokensinto the Grants Program, we achieve the following:Maximized Token Utility:Instead of allowing over 100,000 OP tokens to collect dust, we are putting them to immediate use by funding developers, builders, and contributors.Support for the Optimism Ecosystem:TheRubicon Grants Fundis already approved and active, supporting Rubicon‚Äôs deployment on Optimism. This reallocation will enhance its ability to drive further innovation and growth on the network.Launch of RUBI Token:This OP will help accelerate the open-source development and launch of theRUBI governance token, which will include a substantial airdrop primarily aimed atOptimism users. With over$200 million in trading volume, the vast majority of which has been on Optimism, a large portion of the airdrop will reward active Optimism users. Passing this proposal will accelerate the launch of RUBI, benefiting both the Rubicon and Optimism ecosystems.Proven Track Record with OptimismRubicon has consistently executed all previous grants in good faith. In an incentives analysis conducted for the Optimism Foundation, Rubicon was highlighted as a project that has generated substantial value for the network, particularly in terms of transactions. To date, Rubicon has done over$200 million in trading volume, most of which has been on Optimism. This proposal builds on that track record by ensuring that unused resources are effectively repurposed to further benefit the Optimism ecosystem.Implementation and TimelineIf approved, Rubicon will:Reallocate60,000 OP from Phase 1and over50,000 OP in unclaimed airdrop rewardsinto theRubicon Grants Program.Continue using the Grants Fund to support developers and contributors building on Optimism.Launch theRUBI tokenASAP and upon launch execute the airdrop to active Optimism users.In the event this proposal is not approved, we will continue using the OP tokens as already approved per the rules of the Grants Council. Unfortunately, this includes a large number of tokens that are not providing any utility, hence this proposal for reallocation. Obviously, as well, this mismatch in utilization is due to us pivoting our product stack and the passage of time.ConclusionThis proposal is about optimizing the use of previously approved but idle OP tokens. By reallocating unclaimed airdrop rewards and unused Phase 1 liquidity incentives into the previously approvedRubicon Grants Program, we ensure that these tokens are put to work, supporting the development of Rubicon as an Optimism-native project and the launch of the RUBI governance token. This approach maximizes the impact of OP tokens and directly benefits both the Rubicon and Optimism ecosystems.","This proposal requests reallocating 110,000 OP tokens to Rubicon's Grants Fund.  This includes 60,000 OP from a cancelled Phase 1 initiative and over 50,000 unclaimed from a 792-day-old airdrop.  Reallocation maximizes token utility, supporting Rubicon's Optimism-based development, particularly the launch of the RUBI governance token, which will include a significant airdrop to active Optimism users. Rubicon's proven track record and commitment to the Optimism ecosystem support this request.  Failure to approve leaves significant OP tokens unused.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,Token Resurrection - Analysis of Locked OP Tokens (Season 6 Mission Grantee),https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-resurrection-analysis-of-locked-op-tokens-season-6-mission-grantee/9056,"This task was conducted for the Optimism Collective as part of theSeason 6 Mission Grant.TL;DRThe Token Resurrection project is driven by the need to address a common yet challenging problem in the blockchain ecosystem: recovering tokens that users mistakenly send to smart contracts without token recovery functions. Throughout this project, we have made significant progress in identifying and categorizing such locked tokens, particularly focusing on the OP Mainnet. This report covers the findings fromMilestone 1andMilestone 2of the Optimism Season 6 grant, presenting both the detailed research, analysis and technical work undertaken to bring us closer to resolving this issue for the Optimism community.AcknowledgementWe would like to extend our gratitude to the Optimism Collective and Council Members for supporting the Token Resurrection project through Season 6 Mission Grants.IntroductionTheToken Resurrectionproject was launched to address a growing issue on the OP Mainnet‚Äîusers mistakenly sending OP tokens to smart contract addresses without token recovery functions, effectively locking the tokens. The purpose of this project is to help users recover their lost OP tokens and establish a process to ensure that future tokens sent in error can be recovered.The project was divided into two milestones:Milestone 1focused on researching and documenting the criteria for identifying smart contracts without recovery functions, creating a guide for manual verification, and analyzing the amount of locked OP tokens on the OP Mainnet.Milestone 2aimed to develop a user-friendly interface for users to identify their locked tokens, implement a Merkle root mechanism for secure claims, and test the process to ensure integrity and security.In this report, we summarize the methods, findings, and results from both milestones and propose a solution to recover these lost tokens by minting new tokens and assigning them to our team for distribution.MethodsData Collection and Contract AnalysisWe began by collecting transaction data from the OP token contract on OP Mainnet. Our analysis filtered transactions sent to smart contracts and excluded externally owned accounts(EOAs). This provided a dataset of 6,560 unique contracts holding over 1 OP token each.Each contract was categorized into types:Gnosis Safe Proxy, Vault Contracts, ERC-20 Tokens, and Other Contracts. After removing Gnosis Safe and Vault contracts, we narrowed them down to 1,855 contracts for further review.Contract Categorization1080√ó796 33.5 KBVerification Process and Checklist DevelopmentFor Milestone 1, we developed a checklist to manually verify whether the identified contracts had token recovery functions. We examined contract ABIs for functions like sweep, rescue, or withdrawal mechanisms and excluded contracts that already had built-in recovery functions. After refining our analysis, we focused on 704 contracts with no token outflow, manually verifying if they held locked tokens.Merkle Root and Claim System DevelopmentIn Milestone 2, we developed aMerkle rootmechanism based on the collected data. Using this, we created a secure process for users to identify their locked tokens and sign a proposal to claim them. The data integrity was tested, and a smart contract using the Merkle root was deployed to allow only eligible addresses to claim the tokens.Frontend Development for User InteractionA user-friendly interface was created to allow users to easily identify their locked tokens and sign claims. This interface was integrated with the backend system, enabling seamless interaction with the claim process.Home Page2559√ó1456 186 KBActive Proposal2559√ó1453 231 KBClaim Page2559√ó1459 178 KBToken Recovery2559√ó1530 254 KBResultsMilestone 1 FindingsThrough comprehensive analysis, we identified45 contractsthat hold a total of173,515 OP tokens(~ $279,358.38 - As of 3rd October 2024 at the Price of $1.61 per OP) locked due to user errors. These contracts were thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the tokens were indeed irrecoverable without external intervention.The detailed breakdown of the user addresses and locked amounts can be found in our data sheet, which tracks every verified contract holding locked OP tokens.Milestone 2 DevelopmentsWe successfully implemented theMerkle rootgeneration system and integrated it into a smart contract. The root was tested to ensure data integrity and security, providing a safe mechanism for users to recover their tokens. The interface was designed with usability in mind, allowing users to easily interact with the platform and initiate claims.The system is now ready to process claims once the required OP tokens are minted.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis confirms that173,515 OP tokens(~ $279,358.38 - As of 3rd October 2024 at the Price of $1.61 per OP) are currently locked across45 contractswith detailed analysis provided in Milestones 1 and 2.We propose that theOptimism Collective consider minting or granting an equivalent amount of OP tokensto recover the lost assets, starting with the tokens that are locked in the OP ERC20 contract.This approach is inspired by traditional financial practices where central authorities recover soiled notes and issue replacements to maintain the economy‚Äôs integrity. The Optimism Collective, with its power to mint tokens, could similarly set a precedent by enabling OP token holders to recover lost tokens, ensuring that theNet Total Supplyis maintained as:Net Total Supply = Total Minted OP - Unrecoverable OPBy taking this action, the Collective can support its users while establishing a model for token recovery that reinforces confidence in the OP ecosystem.Next StepsBefore formally submitting this proposal to the Optimism Collective, we will first gather consensus from affected token holders. Specifically, we aim to engage with 120 addresses that have lost $50 worth of OP tokens or more by transferring OP to OP ERC20. These users will be invited to sign the proposal on the Token Resurrection platform, which outlines the request for Optimism Collective to mint and distribute new OP tokens or provide these tokens as a grant by marking these as irrecoverable.The proposed distribution framework is as follows:70%of the recovered tokens will be reimbursed to the original holders.20%will be allocated as a DAO fee.10%will cover platform fees.Once the required signatures from these token holders are collected, we will formally present the proposal to the Optimism Collective for consideration.We will consult with the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the irrecoverable nature of these OP tokens too.Resources -Platform -Token ResurrectionDetailed Research Report -Detailed Report for Optimism CollectiveDetailed findings including the locked OP tokens Database -Locked OP Tokens DatabaseUser Addresses and Locked Amounts -User addresses and Locked amountsMerkle Root -Merkle RootUser guide -User guide","The Token Resurrection project, funded by the Optimism Collective, recovered 173,515 mistakenly locked OP tokens (~$279,358) across 45 smart contracts on the OP Mainnet.  Two milestones involved identifying locked tokens, developing a user-friendly recovery interface with a secure Merkle root system, and verifying irrecoverability.  The project proposes the Optimism Collective mint replacement tokens, distributing 70% to users, 20% to the DAO, and 10% for platform fees, after obtaining consensus from affected users and confirming irrecoverability with the Developer Advisory Board.

Governance  Fund Missions üèπ,Situation of Non-technical applications and Mission Requests,https://gov.optimism.io/t/situation-of-non-technical-applications-and-mission-requests/9051,"The S6 for Grants council has awarded promising applications, setting up stage for great developments in the coming time. But I would like to draw the attention of the Grants Council towards the difficulty for approval for applications that are not technical in nature. Simultaneously, I would like to point out that most non-technical mission requests have been unsuccessful in awarding even a single grant.Below is the latest database on grants for Cycle 28 of the Grants council:Cycle 28 GC Public Database - Google SheetsWithin the sheet, a pattern is visible - non-technical mission requests have no approved applicant and most of the funds are unused, here are the non-technical mission requests -Analysis of Grant ProgramsCreate and Distribute Videos about Optimism Collective GovernanceIntegration of Optimism Gov and RPGF into University CoursesResearch capital migration to the SuperchainCreate Educational Programs that Empower Developers on Optimism - Modified with Lower BudgetOptimism Full Financial Auditthe only exception within the non-technical MRs isOptimism as Venture Studio,  where one application was approved.Technical rubrics with technical cutoffsMultiple questions on the Grants application form are heavily technical in nature, like code audits, developer draw and more, these questions are in practice not applicable to non-technical MRs. But the applications are still judged on a technical pov, making it difficult to score.An example mentioned in the spreadsheet mentioned above, row 4,Optimizing Grant Programs in Web3: A Framework in support of Sustainable Innovation, viewers can notice the caveat in the rubrics results section, in the Code audit part. Half of the rubric scorers have given the application a 0 score out of 4. A couple of scorers have given the application a neutral or average score, but a neutral score is also a predetermined scoring and therefore a ceiling that applicants can get, compared to the technical requirements that give full scoring.image836√ó840 47 KBimage814√ó718 41 KBFor its Developer Draw rubric , it again scored 1.33 out of 4, a low score for a rubric that neither the applicant or the mission request is trying to achieve. If the scoring from just the above two rubrics were removed from cutoff, the project most likely would be eligible to get grants. The project received scores of 35 with 40 Cutoff.Overall rubric scoring are quite rigid, and understandably so to filter out substandard applications. But applications that have cleared preliminary roundup, especially non-technical mission requests should be judged on the requirements of the mission requests and not on a rigid Final cutoff score of 40.Again for example,the rubrics of user/ developer retention, developer draw, audit are not really well placed for the MR of Analysis of Grant programsthe Rubric of demo, developer draw, user/ developer retention are not accurately judging the MR forResearch capital migration to the SuperchainorOptimism Full Financial AuditOverall the rigid measurement methods for applications on two separate ends of the spectrum will end up making a particular end disadvantaged. While OP collective interests are definitely safeguarded with such rigid methodologies to weed out disinterested applicants, it also makes it easy for technical projects to clear the hurdles compared to non-technical ones. Eventually resulting in failure to fulfil the intention of the Mission requests and omission of the potential impacts these could have.Since the non-technical projects have one final chance of application with Cycle 30 fast approaching, I would like the Grants council to reconsider its position on final cutoff score for non-technical applicants, and also leaving out technical rubrics from the non-technical applications, if that is possible within charmverse.@Gonna.ethwould love your advice if Grants Council noticed this or has something planned to mitigate this (or If I missed something on my end) . As most non-technical mission requests have 0 approvals in final cutoffs, and we are closing the final cycle of S6, would be very helpful for non-technical applications to be able to gain level ground in the review process.","The S6 Grants Council's success in funding promising applications is overshadowed by a significant bias against non-technical proposals.  Cycle 28 data reveals almost zero funding for non-technical mission requests, despite many meeting preliminary criteria.  This is attributed to overly technical scoring rubrics (e.g., code audits, developer draw) inappropriately applied to non-technical projects, leading to unfairly low scores and missed funding opportunities.  With Cycle 30 approaching, a crucial final application cycle,  reconsideration of the scoring system for non-technical proposals is urgently requested, suggesting the removal of irrelevant technical rubrics to ensure a fair and equitable evaluation process.

It is a permissionless smart contract platform that boosts the performance of Ethereum whilst inheriting its security.Previously known as Lyra, Derive has been deeply involved in building within the Optimism ecosystem since its early days. Derive launched as one of the first protocols on OP Mainnet and became an early member of the Superchain.The Derive protocol is a decentralized exchange offering options, perpetual futures, and spot markets.  We provide a hybrid CLOB (Central Limit Order Book), RFQ (Request for Quote) platform, structured products, and fixed and variable rate lending.Currently, Derive has $116M TVL, has cleared $8.3B in notional volume and is backed by leading investors such as Framework, GSR, ParaFi, Robot Ventures, DeFi Alliance, Theia Research, C¬≤ Ventures, Apollo Crypto and more!Governance Team:Derive‚Äôs governance team consists of our founders: Michael Spain (Head of Governance), Dom Romanowski (Lead Protocol Engineer), Jake Firzgerald (Head of Product), and Nick Forster (CEO). Together, they bring deep expertise in blockchain technology and extensive experience building in the optimism ecosystemA message to the community and ecosystem:We are truly grateful for the opportunity to participate as a Superchain delegate and to help shape the future of Optimism. Our mission is fully aligned with the Optimistic Vision, and we‚Äôre committed to contributing to its success by leveraging DeFi‚Äôs potential to transform global finance.At Derive, we believe that DeFi holds the key to mass user adoption, and Optimism will lead this journey. By offering core financial infrastructure and global settlement rails, Derive will export the most powerful financial primitives to the Superchain, paving the way for on-chain real-world finance.Unlocking the interoperability of the Superchain is central to achieving our shared goals of maximum composability. To achieve this, we support Collective programs that lay the groundwork for Interop‚Äôs launch, growing key metrics to ensure the ecosystem is ready for adoption. This foundation will drive growth, enhance usability, and create new opportunities for builders across the Superchain.The Optimistic Vision is more than just a shift in technology‚Äîit is a reimagining of decentralized coordination and collaboration. It leverages DeFi‚Äôs power to create sustainable systems for public goods, ushering in a new era of cooperation. Together, we can drive this evolution and solidify Optimism as the backbone of the future financial system.Current/future commitments:Sincelaunchingin December 2023, Derive has committed to a15% sequencer profitshare with the Optimism Foundation for designing and building the OP stack. - View the DeriveGovernance Proposal- All of Derive sequencer profits accrue to Conduit and have been distributed to the Optimism Collective as of 12/16/24. ViewTX hash 1+TX hash 2.0Derive has opted into theOptimism Law of Chains‚Äî an open neutrality framework designed to govern the Superchain network.We are committed to advancing the Superchain and be contributing to decentralization and strength of the OP stack, through active governance participation.Derive will continue to leverage its technical expertise to further support the Optimism CollectiveAs the first prominent app chain built on the OP Stack, Derive is keen to help the Collective understand the unique needs of this growing segment. We have actively participated in  interviews and will continue to share insights with the collective. App chains have different technical and product challenges to generalized L2s, Derive‚Äôs feedback will ensure the collective understands the needs of app chains and gains market share in this segment.How Derive will participate in governance:Overview:At Derive, we understand the shared challenges within the ecosystem‚Äîonboarding users, driving fees, TVL, user adoption, integrations, and volume. These experiences not only align us with the Optimistic Vision but also equip us to contribute meaningfully to governance and vote in ways that foster an exceptional environment for builders and innovators.Goals:We aim to drive decentralization, security, composability, and transparency in every aspect of governance.How we will Vote:We will vote in favor of proposals that align with the goals of the Optimism Collective, focusing on initiatives that promote composability, interoperability, sustainability, and mass adoption of Optimism and the Superchain.How we will Delegate:In addition to our delegation from the Optimism Foundation, Derive is committed to encouraging greater participation in Optimism‚Äôs governance. Derive will also pilot our own delegation program by delegating OP received from previous rounds of RPGF and treasury owned OP to DerviveL2 and to support active Derive community members that participate as Optimism Delegates.Final Thoughts:DeFi‚Äôs true potential lies in its ability to create a decentralized, internet-native financial system that empowers new economic actors‚Äîparticularly AI agents. As AI becomes integrated into traditional financial workflows, it will reduce costs and enable autonomous, value-maximizing actions. Combined with the superior programmability, liquidity, and efficiency provided by DeFi, it‚Äôs inevitable that AI will converge on blockchain infrastructure for economic activity.At Derive, we are opening the gates for real on-chain finance, leading the way toward a new era of tokenized, frictionless trading. This future will bring greater efficiencies, unlock liquidity, and streamline operations, paving the way for a truly global, decentralized financial system. Together, we can drive this evolution and establish Optimism as the foundation of the future financial system.",Summary not available

IntroI‚Äôm Ignas, a solo researcher with the main focus on DeFi. My mission is to provide clear, in-depth insights helping my audiences stay up-to-date with the latest trends while actively supporting DAO development.I believe in the decentralized future and it means actively participating in Optimism Collective DAO in every way I can‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs by serving as a delegate, joining working groups, discussing any proposals or seizing new opportunities that come up. I‚Äôll also be sharing key DAO decisions on X and my blog.3. Delegate Communication IntentI‚Äôm committed to keeping the Optimism community informed with regular, transparent updates. I‚Äôll provide clear insights into my voting choices and reasoning to ensure everyone understands the direction we‚Äôre headed and why.4. Why I Want to be a DelegateCurrently, DeFi DAOs face several internal issues, such as voter apathy leading to governance attacks, insider voting, and voting concentration among a few active voting addresses. Additionally, they face external challenges like regulatory uncertainty.I believe in a decentralized future, even if it seems naive. However, the current state of crypto is plagued by misaligned incentives that prioritize short-term speculative gains over the core DeFi values of self-sovereignty and custody.Equally concerning is the trend of McKinsification in DAOs, where decisions are increasingly made by one or two professional consultant delegates. This discourages individual participation, as their opinions and votes have less impact.To make DeFi DAOs viable, we must align incentives to encourage active participation in governance from the broader crypto community. I believe that community must be at the core of every DAO. Without giving the community a say in protocol governance, we‚Äôre no better than the Web2 companies we aim to replace‚Äîcompanies that view their ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù merely as users to extract value from.I will support initiatives that align token holders with the protocol, such as revenue sharing or other methods to bring value to the token. Token holders are frustrated with exploitative tokenomics that only benefit early insiders who acquired tokens at much lower prices, leaving no upside for new investors. Without incentives to buy and hold tokens, the attractiveness and health of DAOs decline.As mentioned, I will highlight key votes and decisions of the DAO on X and my blog, as I believe the general public is often unaware of important actions being taken.5.

As with previous seasons, it is designed to evaluate the progress of our Optimism Collective processes throughout this season. We want to share an overview of Season 6 of the OP Collective. While the crypto market was distracted bymemecoins, Optimism focused on collaboration and governance evolution, laying the foundation for a stronger decentralized future.DisclaimerData was collected manually, so that errors may exist. We suggest providing feedback as a private message if you spot any misalignment.Season 6The report is divided into main pillars to better segregate the general state of the Collective and governance.Collective growthThe Collective‚Äôs journey continues to expand, branching out and evolving as a standout model for other ecosystems, governance frameworks, and protocols. Witnessing its growth throughout Season 6 was inspiring, and we‚Äôre excited to share this snapshot that highlights the active contributions of so many community members.Since its introduction in Season 3, the ‚ÄúCouncil Model‚Äù has been adopted in other governance structures, driving its expansion and growth by including new members. To help you appreciate this evolution, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what‚Äôs unfolded over time:InSeason 5, 13 individuals participated in 13 roles on the Grants Council, which was divided into three types of reviewers:Builders (5 members),Growth Experiments (5 members), andMilestones & Metrics (3 members). In Season 6, the Grants Council expanded to include 21 roles, which is a61% increasecompared to Season 5, and these roles are filled by 18 participants, with 4 individuals serving in more than one role.Imagen 5-12-24 a las 16.421708√ó718 126 KBThe table above shows the progression of Grants Council members from Season 3 to Season 6.The graph below provides a detailedmember allocation for the Token Houseand shows how individuals may share more than 1 role:Token House S61920√ó2238 288 KBNotes: (1) Anticapture Commission (ACC) is different from a Council because it does not have a budget and is not elected. We wanted to include this information in the graphic to emphasize the growth of governance roles. The ACC has been increased with the addition of 3 new members. (2) The members of the CFC shown are the ones selected initially and it does not include the changes done for the delegates who dropped their positions. (3) Individual delegates are only allowed to serve on one council, but this does not apply to ACC nor govNERDS.Some considerations:Security Council: In Season 6, we voted on the new members of Cohort A who will begin their roles in February 2025. In Season 7, the members of Cohort B will be up for election.govNERDs Maintainers: This is the third season of the initiative, now referred to asgovNERDsMaintainers. The role was previously known as govNERD.Total number of participantsThe Token House currently has45 unique individualsactively involved (see morehere), spanning roles across the Grants Council, Security Council, Developer Advisory Board, Code of Conduct Council, and govNERDs. This count ensures no duplication of individuals across roles. Of these participants, 17 are also delegates, representing 37.8% of the total unique contributors.Note: Members of the core development team were not included in this count. In addition, we also omitted the delegates who are members of the ACC,  in this case, the number would rise to 62 unique members.Season 6 Operating CostsOperational Budgets S61920√ó1594 181 KBNA = No data available in the forum to gather the informationGovernance allocated the following budgets through the vote in Agora:610k OP-Grants Council Operating BudgetSuperchain Mission Reviewers = 90k OPOptimism Mission Reviewers = 270k OPAdditional members = 50k OP (if needed)Audit and Special Mission Reviewer = 30k OPMilestones and Metrics Reviewer = 75k OPMilestone and metrics manager = 10k OPOps Manager and Lead = 40k OPCommunications manager = 5k OPCouncil-related requests for grants = 40k OP (if needed)Total = 610.000 OP (90.000 OP returns to Gov Fund if not needed)90k OP-Developer Advisory BoardLead (1) = 25k OPUpgrade Czar (1) = 17.5k OPOps Lead (1) = 17.5k OPOP Labs Representative (1) = 0 OPAdditional Members (3) = 10k OP each = 30k OP26k OP- Code of Conduct Council4k OP per member6K OP per leadMeanwhile, the Optimism Foundation covers the following costs:36k OP-govNERDs Maintainers12k OP per member (8,000 OP per Season + 2,000 OP per Reflection Period)Amount not disclosed-Security Council‚ÄúInitially, the Optimism Foundation will cover member expenses and may provide members with a stipend.

This change aimed to simplify and improve the application process, building on user research with grant applicants and promoting closer collaboration with the Grants Council. The success of this experiment was set to be evaluated at the end of Season 6.In contrast to Season 5, where each Mission required four votes and explicit delegate support in the forum before moving on to a vote in Agora, Season 6 changed this process. Delegates were no longer needed to approve Mission Request drafts. Instead, at the beginning of the season, Mission Requests were proposed and approved by the following groups: Intent#1by the Collective Feedback Commission, Intent#2was not supported by the Governance Fund, Intent#3Aby the Grants Council, and Intent#3Bby the Foundation Growth Team.As always, delegates and community members were encouraged to provide feedback on Missions via the forum. Additionally, members of the Feedback Commission* or the Grants Council could choose to sponsor ideas from other community members based on this feedback.Note:The Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) was introduced as a pilot during Season 5, and ran its second iteration during Season 6. Its goal is to chart a path toward open metagovernance by formally collecting feedback from the community. Divided into the Token House and Citizens‚Äô House, the CFC plays a key role towards decentralization.Mission Requests From Seasons 5 to 6: Delegates activityRegarding the level of participation and interaction on the forum, we have compiled the following information.Preliminary Notes:Before jumping into the numbers, there are some important considerations. We tracked the submission of missions regardless of their outcomes in the Agora voting process. This approach aims to evaluate the commitment of participants in the Missions v2.5 process. To focus on actors within the Token House, we excluded missions proposed by the Foundation, though you can find themhere.Season 6 Overview:39 Mission Requestswere voted on during Season 6, spanning Cycles#24to#29.

Please note that it shows the people involved rather than the total amount of missions proposed/sponsored. For this, you can check the sectionMission Requests v2.5in this tracker.Missions v2.5 Insights:Season 5 vs. Season 6 OverviewTotal Sponsored Missions:Season 5:74 missionswere proposed/sponsored.Season 6:39 missionswere proposed/sponsored.This represents a 47% decrease in total proposed/sponsored missions from Season 5 to Season 6.Number of Delegates Involved:Season 5:24 delegatesparticipated in proposing/sponsoring missions, accounting for 24% participation of the 100 enabled delegates.Season 6:13 delegates who were involved in missions proposing/sponsorship are part of top 100 delegates.Approximately, the 13 delegates who sponsored missions represent ~36.11% of the 36 unique and actual individuals holding positions in the CFC and the Grants Council, who were eligible to carry out this task. It is important to avoid double counting and to clarify unique individuals, as some of them hold roles in both the Feedback Committee and the Grants Council.Top 100 Delegates:Season 5:95.83% (23 out of 24 delegates)belonged to the top 100.Season 6: 13 delegateswho were involved - whether alone or collaborating with others- in missions sponsorship are part of top 100 delegates,representing 92.86% out of the total members involved.Breakdown of Sponsorship SourcesDelegates in Committees or Councils:Season 5:11 delegatesbelonged to the Grants Council or an Optimism committee.Season 6: 11 Grants Council members and 1 member of the CFCsponsored missions, maintaining committee-driven sponsorship but with fewer missions overall.Non-Council Delegates:Season 5: 13 delegates(non-Council or committee members) sponsored only one mission each.Season 6: 4 peoplewho were neither part of the Grants Council nor the CFC authored missions, showing reduced non-Council participation.Grants Council EngagementThe same number of Grants Council members (11) sponsored Missions in both seasons. However, these members collectively sponsored a significantly higher number of Mission Requests in Season 6, indicating increased engagement or expanded capacity.Season 6 Participation and Voting DataAs we mentioned earlier, in Season 6, both the Grants Council and the Collective Feedback Commission members were empowered to create Mission Requests, subject to approval by the Token House. This change aimed to streamline and refine the application process, based on user feedback from grant applicants, and to foster closer collaboration with the Grants Council. The success of this experiment is set to be reassessed at the end of Season 6.However, since we wanted to measure participation during Season 6, we have considered voting, agora rationales and forum feedback comments as key metrics.DisclaimerThis analysis is based on theDelegate Expectationsas the framework for collecting data from the forum and Agora. Therefore, the metrics and insights presented below are intrinsically tied to these expectations.In cases where someone voted but did not provide their rationale or feedback on Agora, there‚Äôs no way to track it in the information flow, so it has not been counted. If you believe any information should be included, please let us know, and we will update it accordingly.Data Collection and MethodologyThe track employs a mixed-method quantitative approach to analyze delegate behavior within Optimism‚Äôs governance framework. As we mentioned, the dataset was manually curated from two primary sources:Agoraand theOptimism Governance Forum. The aim is to quantify governance participation and engagement through specific metrics: voting behavior, rationales, and feedback. Below, we outline the methodological framework for data extraction and classification.Voting Data ExtractionVotes were collected from Agora, focusing on the top 100 delegates as of a snapshot taken fromCuria dashboardonNovember 7, 2024. This selection criterion ensures a representative analysis of the most influential governance participants. The study defines voting interactions as follows:Vote Classification: Each vote‚ÄîwhetherFor,Against, orAbstain‚Äîis counted as a single interaction.Non-Participation:Delegates who did not voteor werenot part of the top 100 at the time of data extraction are excludedfrom the dataset.Metric Representation: A single column labeled1Vote indicates whether a delegate participated in the vote, independent of the vote‚Äôs direction or nature.Rationale AnalysisThe justifications accompanying votes were extracted from Agora. These entries are essential for understanding the decision-making processes of delegates. Rationales were categorized as follows:Linked Rationales: Some rationales include direct links to the delegate‚Äôs thread or forum posts, offering additional context or in-depth explanations.Unlinked Rationales:Others provide explanations within Agora itself without external links. These are equally considered rationales if they provide the reasoning behind their vote/ substantive insights.Exclusion Criteria:Rationales that merely reiterate the vote (e.g., a simple statement of ‚Äúvoted For‚Äù without further explanation) were excluded from the dataset. Any explanation that extends beyond this minimal clarification was classified as a rationale.Example: If Delegate Y states, ‚ÄúI voted For this proposal,‚Äù without elaborating further, it is not counted in the dataset, as it lacks context (aka. Exclusion Criteria). However, if Delegate Z explains, ‚ÄúI voted For because it aligns with xyz,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI vote For with this link with the reasoning behind the decision‚Äù it is counted as 1 in the database (aka. Linked/Unlinked Rationales). By providing thoughtful reasoning, rationales help the community better understand the decision-making process and contribute to richer, more constructive discussions.Feedback AnalysisFeedback refers to delegate engagement on the Optimism Governance Forum. For this metric, we considered any forum comments related to a specific proposal. This includes:Comment Types:Questions, suggestions, critiques, or enthusiastic endorsements.The nature or sentiment of the feedback was not qualitatively assessed, as the focus of this study remains quantitative.Interaction Count:Each delegate‚Äôs feedback, regardless of the number of individual comments, is counted as asingleinteraction per proposal.Example: Delegate A posted twice in a proposal thread, and Delegate B posted once. Both are recorded as providing 1 Feedback interaction.By standardizing the unit of analysis in this way, we emphasize the breadth of delegate participation rather than the frequency of individual contributions. This approach aims to operationalize governance participation‚Äîvoting, justification, and deliberation‚Äîinto quantifiable metrics. This enables an empirical track of delegate engagement patterns and informs the broader discourse on decentralized decision-making.Additional Considerations for Feedback Tracking:Regarding feedback, it‚Äôs important to clarify that we acknowledge some feedback is not provided through the forum but instead shared during OP Community Calls hosted by OPMichael. This type of feedback is not included in this report, as we focus exclusively on feedback shared on the forum.There are particular cases, such as the govNERDs, where their feedback on the forum was accounted for, but it‚Äôs important to note that these interactions may be related to their responsibilities.Only delegate participation was tracked, meaning forum posts by Foundation / OP Labs members were not included.For votes on Mission Requests, for instance, we counted whether delegates had commented on any of the mission‚Äôs forum posts. If they left multiple comments on different Mission Request posts, this was still counted as a single feedback instance. The goal is to measure general engagement rather than the number of interactions, to standardize the dataset.Example: if Delegate A engages with posts related to Mission A, B, and C, this counts as 1 feedback instance, linked to a single example of their forum contributions.It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that linking forum profiles to wallet addresses is challenging unless there‚Äôs a clear correlation, such as a matching ENS name. This makes it difficult to connect forum feedback with data on Agora at a glance, complicating the tracking of participation by both delegates and non-delegates in forum discussions and voting.Participation RecordWe have tracked the votes, rationales, and feedback for each of the top 100 delegates across all voted proposals. You will find two sheets: one dedicated toSpecial Voting Cycle 23 (parts A and B)related to theReflection Period, and another covering the votes for Season 6, ranging from cycles 24 to 29 (excluding cycle 30, as it was not voted on during the season). Additionally, there are sheets with summarized participation data and extracts by proposal for a more concise overview.Tracker:Tracker - Token House participation and incentives: Season 6 (Cycle 23b-) - Google SheetsTop 100 Delegate Participation during Cycle 23a - Cycle 23b11920√ó1320 144 KBTotal participation during the reflection period (Cycles 23b and 23c), broken down by votes, rationales, and feedback for each proposal.

The bars are organized by the listed proposals, using shades of red to distinguish the variables.Note: Since there were no votes in cycle#30, none have been counted.Top 100 Delegates Participation ConsistencyThe data collected reveals, among other insights, that over 50% of the total delegates in the top 100 engaged in fewer than 25% of the voting checkpoints (whether voting, providing rationale, or giving feedback) during both the reflection period and the season. The seasonal graphs are provided below, and calculations can be found in the ‚ÄúAnalysis‚ÄîConsistency‚Äù sheet in the Tracker.Participation_consistency_in_Refl._Period440√ó273 14.8 KBParticipation_consistency_in_S6_Voting440√ó273 15.3 KBTop 100 delegates participation InsightsThis observation focuses on the top 100 delegates.

While votes are consistent, only 14.3% of interactions are rationales, and 8.4% are feedback (per proposal).Note: However, we recognize that feedback shared during the OP Community Calls has not been quantified but remains an integral part of the delegate feedback process.Final Observations and Next StepsRethinking Delegate Expectations: Best Practices for Delegates and DelegationsBased on the data presented in this paper, there is an opportunity to improve the connection between the delegates who cast votes and those who provide a rationale and feedback for their choices. To put it into numbers, only 14.3% of votes include reasoning, and 8.4% offer feedback per proposal. We want to emphasize that active participation in the forum and the presentation of rationales are key factors that enrich discussions and improve decision-making. Encouraging these practices among delegates helps promote more informed decision-making and prevents voting based solely on majority opinions, as occurred with Fault Proofs and later the Granite upgrade. These efforts will ensure that the Collective continues to evolve as a model within the DAO ecosystem.As a final idea on feedback best practices, we believe it‚Äôs important to document feedback on the forum, as it is the primary way the public can access this information. While summaries and recordings of the OP Community Calls are also availablehere, we emphasize that when questions are raised during Collective calls, the best approach is to ensure they are recorded on the forum.In this regard, we believe it is valuable to recognize and reward these contributions. Encouraging these practices helps establish standards for delegate engagement, driving meaningful progress in decentralized decision-making.Streamlining Governance: The Role of Mission V2.5Assigning mission sponsorship to the Grants Council and Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) has proven effective in streamlining processes and accelerating workflows. By leveraging the expertise of these groups, the approach reduces complexity, minimizes downtime in the grants program, and avoids builder confusion, ensuring a more efficient governance workflow. You can read morehere.Although it may seem like centralization, empowering these committees demonstrates how targeted delegation of responsibilities can lead to faster execution and more impactful outcomes, setting a precedent for future iterations of governance practices. In practice, any member of the Feedback Commission and/or Grants Council may still choose to sponsor a Mission Request authored by any member of the community. Moreover, in reality, the majority of Mission Requests were proposed by members of the Grants Council in Season 5, so this didn‚Äôt change much in practice. As we mentioned earlier, 11 members of the Grants Council were involved in sponsoring missions both in Season 5 and Season 6.However, when analyzing the numbers, we observe a significant 47% decrease in mission proposition/sponsorships from Season 5 to Season 6. This marked reduction in sponsorships prompts us to pause and reflect on its underlying causes. During Season 5, there were 13 mission sponsorships from individuals outside the top 100 delegates eligible to propose. In contrast, Season 6 saw just 4 such sponsorships from individuals outside the Grants Council and the CFC, regardless of whether they were delegates or members of the Collective.This decline presents an opportunity to reflect on inclusivity and consider how to foster better participation from a broader range of actors. It invites us to think and explore ways to encourage more involvement in mission sponsorship moving forward.About Top DelegatesDuring Season 6, we observed that approximately 45% of the Top 100 Delegates participated in each proposal. However, we also identified active delegates outside the Top 100 who not only cast votes but also contribute actively to forum discussions, enriching the governance ecosystem. Their participation, however, has not been quantified here as the focus remains solely on the Top 100.Inour Season 5 report, we raised the question of whether expanding participation requirements to include the Top 150 Delegates would be appropriate, as this could increase diversity and foster greater inclusion in the decision-making process. However, this proposal raises further questions for collective reflection:What would be the impact of increasing the Top 100 to 150?Expanding the range of active delegates might give more prominence to those currently outside the Top 100, but we need to consider whether this change would genuinely enhance participation metrics.Alternatively, what if we reorganized the Top 100?There are undoubtedly active and valuable delegates excluded from this analysis simply because their voting power doesn‚Äôt place them within the current threshold. These individuals deserve recognition. Perhaps the better goal is to ensure that the Top 100 truly reflects the most active, engaged, and aligned delegates. Instead of expanding the list, we should focus on making it more representative and inclusive of those who are actively contributing.About Security Council: Operation Independence and TransparencyUp until and including this season, the Security Council‚Äôs budget has not been disclosed. While we happily witnessed the first election of Cohort A members, the Lead of this council did not present the budget, as it is funded by the Foundation. In this context, we believe that allowing the Security Council to manage its own budget could improve operational efficiency, reduce reliance on the OP Foundation, and strengthen its resilience. Additionally, empowering the Token House to vote not only on council members but also on their incentives could bring further benefits. We invite you to read morehere.About Impact:Operating costs represent a critical area where greater transparency and analysis are essential for the DAO‚Äôs growth and decision-making. One area where the Collective could improve is gaining a clearer understanding of the impact generated by the 762k OP broken down by Council. Having a dedicated and well-organized repository of data related to budget impacts would provide the Collective with a comprehensive view of how seasonal efforts translate into tangible outcomes. This kind of structured insight is invaluable for assessing the real impact of initiatives and ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to drive meaningful progress.Currently, this information appears to be dispersed across the forum, and consolidating it would be highly beneficial. We understand that, due to the nature of grants‚Äîfor instance, projects often outline their goals over a year‚Äîit can be challenging to measure impact in the short term. However, some form of visible accounting could be implemented, leveraging cross-referenced information between council leads and Collective members to enhance clarity and alignment.Your feedback is welcome! Stay optimistic!Future ConsiderationsInvestigate methods to increase rationale and feedback submission.Explore incentive structures to balance participation beyond voting.AppendixSEEDGov prior reportsSeason 4:Token House Participation and Incentives: An Extended AnalysisSeason 5:Token House Participation","Optimism Collective's Season 6 report highlights significant growth and evolution.  The Grants Council expanded by 61%, with increased roles and members.  The Token House now boasts 45 active members across various councils.  Operational budgets totaled 762k OP, while the Intents budget reached 19.5M OP, a substantial increase from Season 5.  While the crypto market focused on memecoins, Optimism prioritized governance improvements and decentralized development.  The report analyzes delegate participation, revealing high voting rates but lower rationale and feedback contributions, suggesting areas for future improvement in engagement and transparency, particularly regarding the Security Council's budget.

Delegates  üèõ,Addressing Voting Apathy in Optimism Governance,https://gov.optimism.io/t/addressing-voting-apathy-in-optimism-governance/9287,"Hey everyone,I‚Äôve been taking some time to dig into participation in Optimism governance, and I wanted to share what I found. Active participation is essential for us to realize Optimism‚Äôs vision, but from my observations, there‚Äôs a noticeable issue: low engagement among many delegates and token holders.Here‚Äôs what I discovered and a few ideas I think we should explore to address this. I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback and thoughts!Findings:After reviewing delegate activity and overall voting participation, here are the key patterns I noticed:Delegate Engagement:‚Ä¢	Optimism has over 900+ registered delegates, but participation varies widely.‚Ä¢	Among the top 100 delegates, here‚Äôs what I found:‚Ä¢	40 delegates (40%) show 0% participation‚Äîthey haven‚Äôt voted on any proposals.‚Ä¢	11 delegates (11%) show low participation (10‚Äì30%), voting only occasionally.‚Ä¢	7 delegates (7%) are moderately active (40‚Äì70%), contributing somewhat regularly.‚Ä¢	15 delegates (15%) are highly active (80‚Äì90%), showing consistent engagement.‚Ä¢	27 delegates (27%) demonstrate 100% participation, actively voting on all proposals.You can dive further into this by checking outMore delegatesInactive or Retired Delegates:I also noticed several delegates who seem to have stopped participating altogether. These delegates still hold profiles, but they‚Äôre no longer voting, which misrepresents the interests of OP holders who delegated to them.General Voting Apathy:A lot of OP token holders, even those who delegate their votes, don‚Äôt seem to monitor their delegate‚Äôs performance or engage in governance. Many also choose not to vote directly, leaving important decisions to a smaller group of active participants. This lack of engagement lowers voter turnout and weakens governance outcomes.The Issue:From what I‚Äôve gathered, this low participation has three major impacts:1.	Misrepresentation: Inactive delegates fail to reflect the broader Optimism community‚Äôs interests.2.	Governance Inefficiency: Lower participation slows decision-making and weakens governance legitimacy.3.	Missed Opportunities: Apathy prevents Optimism from reaching its full potential in innovation and execution.Proposed Solutions:To tackle these challenges, here are some ideas I‚Äôd like us to discuss:Minimum Activity Standards for Delegates:‚Ä¢	We could set a baseline for participation‚Äîmaybe voting in at least 50% of governance cycles within 3-4 months.‚Ä¢	Delegates who don‚Äôt meet this could lose their delegate status or be marked inactive.Clear Designation for Retired or Inactive Delegates:‚Ä¢	Delegates who are no longer active could update their profiles to reflect their status.‚Ä¢	These delegates could either:‚Ä¢	Reassign their voting power to an active delegate, or‚Ä¢	Close their delegate profile entirely.‚Ä¢	This would help ensure token holders aren‚Äôt delegating to inactive representatives.Notifications for Inactive Delegates:‚Ä¢	OP holders could get notified if their delegate becomes inactive or retires.‚Ä¢	We could also provide tools to make it easier for them to reassign their votes to someone more active.Transparency and Reporting:‚Ä¢	Active delegates could submit periodic updates summarizing their activity and voting rationale.‚Ä¢	We could also highlight the most active delegates so OP holders can make better delegation decisions.Community Education and Incentives:‚Ä¢	We could create educational campaigns to help token holders understand why governance participation matters.‚Ä¢	Maybe we could explore rewards for active participation, like reputation boosts or ecosystem recognition.Enforce Governance Standards:‚Ä¢	Should we consider a community-enforced system to monitor activity across both the Token House and Citizen House?Call to Action:What do you think about these ideas? Should we set minimum standards for delegate activity? How can we address inactive or retired delegates? Are there better ways to encourage token holders and delegates to stay engaged?I‚Äôd really love to hear your feedback, suggestions, and any other thoughts you have on this. Together, I believe we can make governance stronger and more representative of the entire Optimism community.@Gonna.eth,@optimistic_emily,@Michael","Optimism's governance suffers from low delegate and token holder participation.  Analysis reveals that 40% of top 100 delegates are inactive, impacting representation and efficiency.  Solutions proposed include minimum activity standards for delegates, clearer designation of inactive delegates, notifications for OP holders, improved transparency, community education, and potential incentives.  The goal is to strengthen governance and ensure it accurately reflects the entire Optimism community.  Feedback and collaboration are encouraged.

Delegates  üèõ,GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread,https://gov.optimism.io/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/2728,"This thread is intended to provide a record of GFX Labs‚Äô voting and communication around the reasoning of each vote. Subsequent voting communications will be added to this thread over time.3 Polls Ending June 26Proposal ASummary:This is a batch vote for 24 grants, ranging from Chainlink to Synthetix to Gelato. It includes 23 different protocols, and a full list with requested amounts of OP and individual spending planscan be found here. This vote is to approve or deny all 24 grant requests together.Recommendation: Vote Yes.Batched approvals of grants are poor governance, as they remove oversight, overload voters, and generally bundle together spending in a way such that many stakeholders get a turn at funding. Optimism is in early days and requires developing a strong ecosystem for users, but we feel strongly that unrelated spending proposals should not be bundled together like this again in the future.Proposal BSummary:Thisproposalwould distribute a 1,000,000 OP grant to Uniswap. 200,000 OP of which would be earmarked for grants from Uniswap to builders on Optimism. The remaining 800,000 would be earmarked for liquidity mining on Uniswap Optimism.Recommendation: Vote Yes.While the pools to be incentivized have not yet been specified, Uniswap is core infrastructure and it is difficult to imagine a successful Optimism without a robust adoption of Uniswap, which also has a proven network effect that makes users and liquidity sticky after incentives eventually end.Proposal CSummary:Thisproposalwould distribute a 300,000 OP grant to 0x. The entirety would be earmarked for the 0x grants program, with an intent for at least 50% to be directed to NFT/gaming projects on Optimism.Recommendation: Vote Yes.Like Uniswap, 0x is known as an important piece of on-chain infrastructure. It also has a grants program with an established history and ability to channel funding. The focus on non-financial uses of Optimism hold the potential to create more diverse use cases for Optimism, and 0x‚Äôs recent shift into NFT infrastructure strongly suggest they have the expertise to distribute grants in that industry effectively.NB: GFX is having difficulty voting on Snapshot, which does not currently support multisig voting on Optimism. We use best practices for handling assets internally ‚Äì including voting power that has been delegated ‚Äì and utilize a multisig on our delegate address. We are attempting to find a workaround, but ultimately, Snapshot needs to support voting from multisig addresses.","GFX Labs' voting record on three Optimism grant proposals is documented. Proposal A, a batch vote for 24 grants, is recommended for approval despite concerns about poor governance. Proposals B (a $1,000,000 grant to Uniswap) and C (a $300,000 grant to 0x) are both recommended for approval due to the recipients' importance to Optimism's ecosystem.  A technical issue prevents GFX from directly voting via Snapshot's multisig limitations.  Internal processes ensure responsible asset handling and voting.

We believe that the focus should be on encouraging developers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods where a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to the space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for developers.Initially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current financial and political standards we have. The Optimistic vision details a necessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable and will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing the financial gain they would gain elsewhere.Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:This is a ‚ÄúWorking‚Äù Constitution.Currently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing to see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation throughout the next few years.Decentralized governance is a relatively new field within Web3. It is an important topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems, such as voting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy, need to be tackled. We believe that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance methods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a protocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you so far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes experimentation.OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.This experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives through token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and allow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term improvement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive public funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner.Those individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this means reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house who have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward and see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.We favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the framework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders and delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is most likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the structure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it would be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities to the DAO.DisclosureThrough our holding company, we have invested in multiple projects to advance growth and governance for them.

We appreciate this community‚Äôs innovative work to advance L2 adoption and make on-chain experimentation more accessible.

Through these efforts, we hope to contribute to bringing the masses to the Superchain and the Web3 space as a whole.Initial Approach to GovernanceWhile governance is new territory for us, we‚Äôre committed to engaging with this community and supporting innovation on Optimism.

We may also increase the number of delegates as we grow.We will continue to grow with the Collective, learn and iterate within its governance, and transition into a more active role as delegates in the future.Closing ThoughtsWe view governance as an evolving model that requires open-minded participation and feedback. While new to this role, we are committed to upholding Optimism‚Äôs innovative spirit and contributing value to its growth.

Delegates  üèõ,Polynya - Delegate Communication Thread,https://gov.optimism.io/t/polynya-delegate-communication-thread/3085,"I have finished my votes for Gov Fund Phase 1 Season 1.My general impression thus far is that most proposals are a mixed bag, with very few high-quality projects I‚Äôd be excited to support without reservations. Since Optimism is a new collective & ecosystem, I have been very lenient as I‚Äôve thought it‚Äôs OK to give mediocre or unproven protocols the benefit of doubt. Of course, over the 4 cycles I have become gradually more strict about my votes. For Season 2, I‚Äôll only be voting for proposals by a) protocols that have proven themselves over a reasonable period of time (e.g. >1 year); b) have a very clear case for incentivizing usage directly on Optimism, and c) a co-incentives program with an amount you can safely match (I don‚Äôt want to see a $5M market cap project asking for 500,000 OP). Of course, there can be exceptional proposals which contribute to the Optimism ecosystem another way. I realize this is going to be unpopular, and I‚Äôm going to receive some hate mail, but that‚Äôs OK. I believe granting of $OP tokens through Gov Fund must be earned, rather than being a bet. There are other funds like the Seed Fund or RPGF that may be more appropriate for a lot of proposals.I also continue to be very uncomfortable granting OP tokens and building an ecosystem while Optimism is a de-facto centralized sidechain, just with 7 days of social disputes available. I‚Äôd like to see Optimism urgently have a) permissionless fraud proofs, b)decentralized contract upgradability, including emergency.I‚Äôd only be truly comfortable when we also havedecentralized sequencersandeconomic sustainability for $OP.I‚Äôm not going to do anything drastic like protest by voting everything Against, however I‚Äôll be much more careful with my votes until Optimism itself is in an acceptable place. I‚Äôd like to see the OP Labs and Optimism Foundation teams provide a detailed roadmap update on where they are with the above-mentioned decentralization goals.I generally agree with thelearnings and steps being takenfor Season 2 and look forward to participating in the discussions during the Reflection Period ‚Ñ¢. I also hope to see some accountability and results data for previously approved proposals around this time.","Having completed Optimism's Gov Fund Phase 1, the author expresses disappointment with the overall proposal quality, initially showing leniency but tightening voting criteria for Season 2.  Future votes will prioritize proven protocols (operating >1 year), clear Optimism usage incentives, and reasonable co-incentive programs.  Concerns remain about Optimism's centralized nature, demanding permissionless fraud proofs, decentralized upgradability, sequencers, and economic sustainability before fully supporting proposals.  While acknowledging potential backlash, the author advocates for earned, not bet, OP token grants and suggests alternative funding for less mature projects. A roadmap addressing decentralization is urgently requested.

These Missions have been chosen to focus the Collective on being able to accurately measure an important sub-set of contributions. We must first refine and perfect the ability to reward these contributions before expanding our capabilities to measure additional contributions.For more information on Retro Funding in 2025, and how it relates to our long-term commitment to Ether‚Äôs Phoenix, check out theRetro Funding 2025 blog post.While not a Season 7 initiative, the Foundation plans to propose an OP Stack program, starting with a limited scope around supporting Ethereum Core Development, in Season 8.Retro Funding MissionsThe Collective is consolidating token allocations under a unified Mission Framework, aligning Retro Funding with other token allocation programs within Optimism. While Retro Funding continues to pursue the impact = profit vision, this alignment of the entire Collective around a common Mission framework will ensure cohesive operations across all token allocation programs.What is an Evaluation Algorithm?An Evaluation Algorithm defines the measurement of output and outcomes of a Mission. This can involve both human qualitative assessment and data-driven quantitive measurements. Rewards are allocated by running the evaluation algorithm at one or multiple measurement dates. The Evaluation algorithm used in Retro Funding Missions will evolve throughout the Retro Funding program based on the feedback by selected Citizens.Retro Funding: Onchain BuildersRetro Funding: Onchain Builders rewards projects that drive cross-chain asset transfers, enabled through interop, by growing the Superchain across eligible OP Chains.Expected impact on the Intent: Drive cross chain asset transfers by growing the Superchain economy and growing the adoption of interop among onchain buildersTotal budget: up to 8M OP from the Retro FundEligibility: Projects are eligible who have deployed their own contracts on supported OP Chains.

The Foundation is assigning a minimum OP Amount for the round of 1.1M OP and a maximum OP amount of 3.5m OP. Citizens will be able to vote for an OP amount within the range of minimum and maximum which they believe appropriately rewards the impact within the round. The round allocation will be decided by taking the median of Citizens‚Äô votes.The voting on the rounds OP allocation is an experiment in community-lead budget allocation.The outcomes of this experiment will inform the evolution of the budgeting process in the future, which is subject to change based on learnings.The following are considerations for the minimum and maximum values set by the Foundation:Retro Funding 3 benchmark: Approximately 1.1M OP was allocated to Optimism Governance Contributions in Retro Funding 3 at the end of 2023. The minimum round allocation for Retro Funding 6 matches this value, under the assumption that impact within Optimism Governance has been consistent or has increased since the last round.Optimism Governance growth: Within the scope period of October 2023 until September 2024, Optimism Governance has grown significantly. Within the timeframe a number of new governance leadership roles, such as the Developer Advisory Board, Security Council, TH & CH Feedback Commissions, Anticapture Commission have been introduced. The infrastructure and tooling which Optimism Governance relies on has been extended, introducing approval ranking in the Token House, partial delegation, Citizens‚Äô House Protocol upgrade veto rights, Retro Funding sign up tooling and more. To reflect his growth, the Foundation set a maximum OP allocation of 3.5m OP.Voting DesignFor the round, a number of guest voters will be selected to further drive understanding on how different voter selection methods impact resource allocation decisions. You can learn more about the Retro Funding 6 Guest voter selection experimenthere.Retro Funding 6 will adopt the voting design from round 5, where voters are sorted into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications.

You will be able to apply again for future rounds.Where can I nominate projects?Theres no nominations process in this round, instead projects sign-up directly. So remind your favourite projects to apply!Why do I need Farcaster to sign up for Retro Funding?You will need Farcaster account to sign up for Round 6, if you don‚Äôt already have a Farcaster account, you‚Äôll need to make one. Your Farcaster account isn‚Äôt just a sign-in method for Round 6, it‚Äôs also your Optimist Profile and will be used for future Retro Funding applications and other interactions with the Optimism Collective.The easiest way to sign up for a Farcaster account is via the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) app, which acts as a wallet to easily manage the keys of the newly created account. Upon sign-up, Warpcast currently charges a $7 fee to rent storage on the network. As a decentralized social network, Farcaster content is not stored on centrally controlled servers, but rather in Hubs, which are a [distributed network of servers](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/hubs). Each unit of storage buys 5000 casts, 2500 reactions and 2500 follows. For those who prefer to register a Farcaster account via contracts directly, this can be done via the [ID Registry Contract](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts).

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Lessons learned from two years of Retroactive Public Goods Funding,https://gov.optimism.io/t/lessons-learned-from-two-years-of-retroactive-public-goods-funding/9239,"tl;dr-In 2023, Optimism ran two megarounds. In 2024, Optimism ran one round per domain per year. We‚Äôve learned that mega rounds devolve into popularity contests and annual feedback loops are too slow. In 2025, Optimism should focus on fewer domains, iterate more rapidly, and refine what works.In 2023, Optimism had everyone vote on everything. In 2024, Optimism ran experiments around expertise-based voting and metrics-based voting. We‚Äôve learned what humans are good at - and what data is good at. In 2025, Optimism should take the best of both (and set aside the rest).In both 2023 and 2024, we struggled at measuring the success of Retro Funding itself. The time for not knowing how well this works is over.Full post‚Ä¶This was supposed to be simpleAs Vitalikwrotewhen initially describing the mechanism: ‚ÄúThe core principle behind the concept of retroactive public goods funding is simple: it‚Äôs easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful.‚ÄùNow, nearly two years into this experiment, we should be able to look back at the mechanism of Retro Funding itself and apply this same analysis.Specifically, we want to understand:Can people actually agree on what was useful?Under what circumstances does retroactive funding produce superior outcomes?Simple, right? Not entirely.My team at OSO has been trying to help Optimism answer some of these questions sinceRound 2. In this post, we‚Äôll look at a very high level at what‚Äôs happened across five rounds of Retro Funding (Rounds 2-5) and share some of our observations.The good news is there are some clear learnings about what people are good at agreeing on and how to create the right conditions for consensus. These learnings are the result of deliberate experiments that were undertaken in 2024, for instance, experimenting with metrics-based voting in Round 4 and expertise-based voting in Round 5.The not-so-good news is that we don‚Äôt (yet) have the data to show that retroactive funding produces superior outcomes.In our view, solving the measurement problem is the most important thing to get right in 2025. We need to build an engine for measuring the impact of each allocation cycle‚Äîone that gives us more than a vague sense that it‚Äôs working and one that gives the collective more than a single round (per domain) per year to see what‚Äôs working.Our recommendations include:Continuing to move away from project-based votingFinding the right balance of metrics and experts‚Äô subjective assessmentsFocusing on a relatively narrow set of domains but with more rapid feedback cyclesBasically, if 2024 was all about experimenting on expertise-based voting and metrics-based voting, then 2025 should be about combining the best of both. Once we discover the optimal combinations, we can expand the scope and complexity of rounds.What humans are good at (and what data is good at)Optimism has now completed five rounds that use badgeholder-based voting to allocate tokens.Each round had different design parameters and these have allowed us to learn different things about what humans and data are good at.Here‚Äôs a quick summary:RoundDesign ParametersKey Lessons LearnedRound 2Projects had to be nominated by a badgeholder in order to make the round. Badgeholders had to determine outright token allocations for each of the 200 projects with minimal tooling.Project nomination process was awkward and time-consuming for badgeholders. Badgeholders needed more structure in the voting process; everyone came up with their own scattershot method (eg, sharing spreadsheets to rate their favorite projects).Round 3Any project could sign-up for one or more domains and self-report their metrics. Badgeholders would do a light review to filter out spam, but left everything else intact. Projects had to get at least 17 votes in order to receive rewards. Over 600 projects ended up getting approved. Badgeholders still had to determine outright token allocations for each of the 600+ projects. Badgeholders could also create ‚Äúlists‚Äù recommending projects and outright allocations.Voters felt overwhelmed. It was very difficult to differentiate between weak projects and good ones with little reputation; borderline projects led campaigns to reach the quorum line. The domain categories were not strictly enforced and thus mostly useless to badgeholders. Impact metrics were not comparable. Every list was different and there was no quality control. Onchain projects received a smaller share of the token pool than most badgeholders felt they deserved.Round 4Focused only on onchain builders with strict eligibility requirements (based on onchain activity). Badgeholders were provided metrics instead of projects to vote on. Over 200 projects were approved out of 400+ applicants. Projects could receive a multiplier if they were open source.Badgeholders found voting much easier. Results had a steep power law distribution, but voters generally felt the top projects were rewarded fairly. Metrics alone couldn‚Äôt capture quality, momentum, and other nuances, highlighting the need for more complex evaluation signals. Metrics did not work as well for certain ‚Äúcutting-edge‚Äù sub-domains (eg, 4337 related apps). The open source multiplier was too complex to enforce consistently.Round 5Focused only on OP Stack contributions with strict eligibility requirements (enforced by a small review team). Returned to project-based voting, grouping voters by expertise and assigning each to a single category of 20-30 projects, rather than hundreds.Results were very flat, and voters felt the top projects were not rewarded sufficiently. Perverse incentive to divide work across multiple smaller contributions / teams in order to receive more tokens. Grouping by expertise revealed significant differences between experts and non-experts both in project selection and allocation strategy. After seeing both allocations, voters preferred experts‚Äô selections.In Round 6, which is currently underway, Optimism is experimenting with impact attestations and a more aggressive set of distribution options for badgeholders.Clearly, the optimal Retro Funding design hasn‚Äôt been found yet. But we do see some recurring themes:Humans are good at relative comparisons (what‚Äôs more valuable)Humans are bad at outright comparisons (how much more valuable)Data is good at providing comprehensive coverage of things that are countableData is bad at dealing with nuances and qualitative concepts that experts intuitively understandWe‚Äôve also learned that people only reveal their true opinions after seeing the result. This follows basic product theory: you need to show people something and iterate based on their reactions in order to build something they actually want.Metrics-driven, experts in the loopThese hard-earned lessons inform our recommendation for how Optimism approaches future round designs. The goal should be to combine the best parts of what humans and data are good at.Here is the basic framework we propose:We use metrics-based evaluations to propose initial token allocations within a domain.We let subject matter experts review, fine-tune the metrics, and choose the best allocations.Over time, we identify which metrics best align with experts‚Äô qualitative assessments, refining models through consistent backtesting.This approach leverages data‚Äôs systematic reach with human intuition‚Äôs nuanced adjustments. Metrics establish a quantitative foundation, ensuring that projects are assessed objectively and fairly, while expert review adds layers of qualitative nuance, including quality, innovation, and momentum. An iterative feedback loop lets us adjust metrics based on expert insights‚Äîparticularly valuable when experts consistently revise scores or highlight lower-scoring projects. This process is similar to RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) in machine learning, but with an emphasis on retaining clear, interpretable inputs for expert adjustments.Practically, we implement this by establishing metrics within a domain, generating proposals for initial allocations (by weighting metrics into an evaluation algorithm), and refining the allocations with expert input. Such an approach should work best in domains with lots of verifiable data, e.g., onchain builders and software dependencies.This framework should also perform well in fast-evolving domains. Experts can adjust allocations to reflect Optimism‚Äôs shifting priorities (e.g., prioritizing interoperability transactions over standard transactions), address data blind spots (e.g., fine-tuning metrics for 4337-related projects), and reward innovation (e.g., favoring fast-growing, high-potential projects over more established but static ones).One essential element is running funding rounds even more frequently and continuously. Doing so lets us pinpoint metrics most correlated with desirable outcomes and backtest these metrics and evaluation algorithms against historical data. Each round remains an experiment, but the cumulative impact across rounds should reveal a clear, positive trend over time.Hard Choices ‚Üí Easy LifeThe end goal remains super ambitious: to develop predictive models that guide economic policy for the collective. For instance, in 2025, we may want to discover that incentivizing certain behaviors predictably leads to increased interoper transaction volume.Reaching this goal won‚Äôt be easy. It requires focus, as the outcomes are highly path-dependent.Currently, hard choices need to be made around domain scopes. Any changes may be unpopular, especially among community members accustomed to existing Retro Funding patterns. However, narrowing the scope and committing to continuous improvement within scopes are essential steps in reaching the top of the mountain.image800√ó661 27 KBLooking back, we‚Äôll likely see some initial assumptions were overly optimistic or naive. But we can‚Äôt improve by continuing to ‚Äúspray and pray.‚Äù Governance is ultimately about making hard choices with limited resources.Optimism has spent two important years learning, but it‚Äôs time to double-down on what works in 2025.",Summary not available
Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,When Is Deliberation Useful for Optimism Governance?,https://gov.optimism.io/t/when-is-deliberation-useful-for-optimism-governance/9142,"When Is Deliberation Useful for Optimism Governance? Experimental Evidence from Retro Funding 4‚Äôs Deliberative Process‚Üí Full draft of the academic paper (linked here soon)SummaryOne of the most important questions for Optimism governance is:How do we increase the quality of discussion and information exchange so that participants can make informed decisions?One idea is to facilitate spaces dedicated to deliberation, and deliberative processes are gaining traction as a democratic tool for both offline (eg,Ireland‚Äôs citizens assembly) and online (eg,Meta‚Äôs community forums) governance. Despite the rise in adoption, there are open questions about when and how deliberation is useful. Moreover, web3 introduces new opportunities to study the effects of deliberation in a governance structure that progressively decentralizes over time, and in the case of Optimism participants hold immediate decision-making power and the results of the deliberative process were binding. To understand how deliberation might be useful in our governance system, we designed a deliberative process experiment prior to Retro Funding 4 in Optimism‚Äôs Citizens House. (See these links for more context on thetopicandlogistical detailsof Optimism‚Äôs deliberative process.)In our experiment, we find that:(1) Participants in the deliberative process significantly increased their knowledge on arguments for and against the contested topic(2) Participants in the deliberative process significantly increased their trust in the opinions of other badgeholders(3) Deliberation seemed to increase support for deliberation as an effective decision-making tool(4) Deliberation moved participants toward consensus on only one of four categories(1) Deliberation increases knowledge on arguments for and against contested topicTheory:Potential benefits of deliberation include more informed and reflective judgements, a greater sense of internal political efficacy (that is, confidence people have in their personal knowledge and competence to engage in political discussions and make informed decisions).Outcome to test Hypothesis 1: Deliberation Increases KnowledgeOutcome:How would you rate your knowledge on the arguments for/against deducting external funding (e.g., VC funding, Optimism grants, or other grants) from public goods rewards?Scale:0 (very low knowledge) ... 4 ... 7 (very high)i.

With a p-value of 0.003 this is a statistically significant shift in opinions among participants, and substantively moving nearly 1 point on a 7-point scale is quite meaningful. Thus, we find strong evidence that those who participated in the deliberative process significantly increased their knowledge on the arguments for and against the contested topic. However, it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that there might be other factors during that time period that could‚Äôve increased knowledge on these topics other than the deliberative process itself, so comparing the participants (treatment) to non-participants (control) is helpful to rule out those factors, which we discuss below.ii. Participants reported more knowledge on the topic than non-participantsIn addition to comparing changes among participants before and after deliberation, we also compared post-deliberation knowledge of deliberative process participants to non-participants. We were able to do this because all 105 badgeholders who voted in Retro Funding Round 4 answered these same survey questions as part of the post-voting survey (which took place shortly after the conclusion of the deliberative process).If we simply compare the means of deliberative process participants (treatment group) and non-participants (control group), however, we‚Äôre not accounting for possible selection bias: Only half of the 50 randomly selected citizens ultimately chose to participate, and there are probably some systematic, non-random differences between those that accepted the invite and those that didn‚Äôt (for instance, maybe those who accepted the invite are more engaged, or have more time, etc). Those systematic differences might also influence the outcome of knowledge on the contested topic, as opposed to differences in knowledge being driven by participation in the deliberative process.Effect of Deliberation on Knowledge (IV Estimation)VariableEstimateStd. Errort statistic(Intercept)5.1130.14834.54Deliberation participation0.3810.4140.92Adjusted R-Squared0.051Wald Test0.8455 on 1 and 103 DFTo get around this, we ran an instrumental variable (IV) analysis, which essentially takes into account this selection bias and adjusts the estimates accordingly. With this model, we see there is about a 0.4 increase in knowledge (fairly substantive on a 7-point scale) but the relatively large standard errors suggest there‚Äôs some noise in the data (probably also due to the fact that n = 24 is a relatively small sample size). This noise, which results in a lack of statistical significance, might also mean that knowledge levels were not as distinctly different between both treatment and control groups because there were other factors in the broader environment that both groups were exposed to and that also influenced knowledge ‚Äî such as spillover effects from the deliberative process ‚Äútreatment,‚Äù e.g. public gov forum updates summarizing the arguments for or against deducting funding.The table below shows the raw means of the control group (the 62 badgeholders who were not invited to participate in the deliberative process but who did vote in Retro Funding Round 4) compared to the ‚Äúcompliers‚Äù (the 24 badgeholders who participated in both deliberative process sessions) and the ‚Äúnon-compliers‚Äù (the 19 badgeholders who were randomly selected to participate in the deliberative process but did not choose to, but who did ultimately vote in Retro Funding Round 4).

I wouldn‚Äôt say they influenced my views much though, but they helped clarify things for me. ""It‚Äôs worth noting that multiple responses explicitly said that while the deliberative process enhanced knowledge on the topic, it didn‚Äôt necessarily change their opinion. This aligns with the findings we discuss in a later section on whether deliberation seemed to increase consensus on the contested topic.(2) Deliberation increases trust in opinions of other badgeholdersTheory:Deliberative processes like citizens‚Äô assemblies provide a space where participants can develop trust through dialogue and problem-solving, and past empirical work has found that deliberation can increase empathy and trust between participants as individuals are exposed to the lived experiences and perspectives of others.Outcome to test Hypothesis 2: Deliberation Increases Social CohesionOutcome:To what extent do you trust the opinions of other badgeholders?Scale:0 (very low trust) ... 4 ... 7 (very high trust)i.

In the case ofVC Funding, the majority vote switched in favor of being ‚Äúagainst deducting‚Äù but remained at a close margin. For the category ofRevenue, it does appear that opinions became more aligned, with only about 20% of badgeholders in favor of deducting post-deliberation, compared to 46% being in favor of deducting pre-deliberation. The pairwise t-test results for changes in opinion on deductingRevenuealso confirm that this is a statistically significant shift. There is no statistically significant shift in the other three categories.Support for Deducting External Funding (Pre-deliberation):VC FundingOP GrantsGrantsRevenueIn Favor of Deducting1414811Against Deducting10101613Total24242424Support for Deducting External Funding (Post-deliberation):VC FundingOP GrantsGrantsRevenueIn Favor of Deducting111565Against Deducting1391819Total24242424What‚Äôs Unique about the Optimism Case?There are some things unique to Optimism‚Äôs deliberative process that should be taken into account when interpreting these findings:i. Highly engaged populationThis deliberative process was conducted among Optimism‚Äôs badgeholders, a group of highly engaged governance stakeholders who skew technical in their professions and are based in approximately 20 different countries. Of the 50 badgeholders randomly selected to participate, the 25 who showed up were likely especially engaged as they made time to participate in two 90-minute deliberative sessions (and in most cases, attended a third optional 90-minute deliberative session) in addition to completing the pre-reading before each session. In some cases, participants joined despite being based in inconvenient time zones (e.g., joining from Asia where the local time was 2am). Throughout the process, participants repeatedly requested additional pre-reading homework and asked for a third deliberative session.ii. Direct policy implicationsAnother unique feature of this deliberative process is the fact that, pending ratification from the full set of badgeholders, the proposed definition of profit decided upon during the deliberative process would be directly implemented into the upcoming Retro Funding Round 4. This is distinct from deliberative processes in other contexts that have been criticized for being performative, or at best advisory. Optimism, on the other hand, is a governance structure that progressively decentralizes over time, meaning badgeholders held immediate decision-making power in Retro Funding Round 4.iii. Lack of clarity on the topicThroughout the process, it became clear that the topic of whether external funding should be deducted from public goods funding rewards was a question that also contains value judgements, whereas the resulting policy was meant to focus on the practical implementation details of this question. For example, a discussion about whether VC fundingshouldbe deducted from public goods funding is different than a discussion about whether VC fundingcouldbe deducted given limitations in what funding data is available for projects and whether it‚Äôs possible to deduct accurately. There were also time constraints given that the new definition of profit needed to be ratified before the upcoming Retro Funding Round 4.Recapping Key TakeawaysIn sum, the key takeaways from this analysis are:(1) Running another deliberative process could help to increase participants‚Äô knowledge on the arguments for/ against the deliberated topic:There‚Äôs strong evidence thatthose who participated in the deliberative process became more knowledgeable about the topic, with badgeholders reporting a significant increase in their understanding of the arguments for and against the topic after engaging in the deliberative process.Comparing participants to non-participants,deliberative process participants tended to report higher knowledge than non-participantsafter the deliberative process, though whether deliberation alone is driving this difference is less certain (likely due to the small sample size of 24 participants, or perhaps spillover effects from the deliberative process also increased non-participant knowledge which makes the post-deliberation difference less meaningful)(2) Running another deliberative process could help to increase participants‚Äô trust in the opinions of fellow governance participants:There‚Äôs strong evidence thatparticipating in the deliberative process led badgeholders to trust each others‚Äô opinions more, with badgeholders reporting a significant increase in trust in the opinions of other badgeholders after engaging in the deliberative process.Comparing participants to non-participants,deliberative process participants tended to report higher trust than non-participantsafter the deliberative process, though again, whether deliberation alone is driving this difference is less certain (likely due to the small sample size of 24 participants)(3) Running the deliberative process seemed to encourage support for the deliberative process itself as an effective decision-making toolThis support for a deliberative process as a useful governance tool came fromparticipants and the broader population of non-participantsThis support came fromthose who voted in favor and those who voted againstthe new definition of profit that was decided during the deliberative process(4) Participating in the deliberative process only seemed to increase consensus on one of four categories under the deliberated topicThis suggests thatdeliberation may foster agreement on specific aspects of a topic(perhaps through increased trust and information exchange, as documented above) though not universally across all categories, so this question probably merits further studyThis finding is likely also influenced by thepractical constraints and lack of clarity surrounding the topic of the deliberative process,and the fact that the category (Revenue) which did see movement toward consensus is less polarizing and more clearly scoped than other categories (e.g., moral aversion to VCs, or lack of clarity on what is considered an OP Grant, etc.)What This Means for Optimism GovernanceWe found evidence that deliberation can be a tool for knowledge exchange and increasing social cohesion, so this might make sense in contexts where comprehension of complex topics, or where bridging a divide between parties with low levels of trust, is important. Specifically, our findings suggest that a deliberative process might be useful for improving comprehension of complex documents like theLaw of Chainsor Blockspace Charters. A deliberative process could also be useful as a tool to facilitate conversation between the Token House and Citizens House in a way that improves trust in the other House and thereby reduces gridlock.We found no strong evidence that deliberation shifted views toward consensus on the overall topic deliberated, suggesting that this type of deliberation tied to a binding policy recommendation may be less useful for the most polarizing topics, or for philosophical values questions which are difficult to coerce into a measurement question. With this in mind, we believe further exploration and study is warranted as there were unique considerations related to the specific topic that was discussed and which may have impacted outcomes. There are no immediate plans to implement another deliberative process experiment but we may explore this as appropriate.Finally, we are very grateful to our facilitators who made this deliberative process happen:@AntoineVergne (Missions Publiques), In√™s NW (In√™s NW), and Andrea Gallagher (RnDAO).Thanks for reading and would love to hear any reactions in the comments below!","This study examined the effectiveness of a deliberative process within Optimism's governance system before Retro Funding 4.  The experiment, involving 24 randomly selected badgeholders, showed statistically significant increases in participants' knowledge about the debated topic and their trust in other participants' opinions.  While deliberation boosted support for future deliberative processes, it only led to consensus on one of four funding categories.  The findings suggest deliberation's utility in improving understanding of complex issues and fostering trust, but its impact on achieving overall consensus remains uncertain, particularly for highly polarizing topics.  The study highlights the need for further research, acknowledging limitations stemming from the small sample size and the specific context of the experiment.

Instead of funding based on future potential, it retroactively compensates work that has proven valuable for the Optimism Ecosystem and offers a sustainable model for individuals to receive rewards. Round by round, the decision on reward distribution is decided by a vote in the Optimism Citizens House.TheGovXS teamwas chosen to evaluate voting designs for Optimism Retro Funding through theFoundation Mission Request: Evaluating Voting Design Tradeoffs for Retro Funding.The objective: Improve Optimism governance accessibility and grow the Optimism Collective‚Äôs understanding of optimal voting designs to encourage diverse, informed, and values-aligned voting behavior.Delivering on this objective, GovXS developed a new voting evaluation framework drawing fromSocial Choice Theory. We apply theoretical analysis and agent-based simulations to assess past Retro Funding voting designs across six dimensions:1. Resistance to malicious behavior and collusion:Measure to what extent a malicious voter (or a group of coordinated malicious voters) can impact voting outcomes2. Incentive compatibility:Prove or disprove that the voting design isincentive compatible(‚Äùevery participant can achieve their own best outcome by acting according to their true preferences‚Äù)3. Simplicity for Voters & Expected Outcome:Measure if voters can easily understand how the voting design works and how to best achieve their goals4.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Joan's RPGF6 Reflections,https://gov.optimism.io/t/joans-rpgf6-reflections/9261,"PreconditionsRound scopeRPGF6was designed to reward contributions to Optimism Governance. Impact must have been generated between October 2023 - September 18th 2024, and the following 3 categories were recognized:Governance Infrastructure & ToolingGovernance AnalyticsGovernance LeadershipVoting design and my role in itAlong with the total allocation (no less than 1.1M OP, and no more than 3.5M OP), each voter was asked to vote on the distribution of funds between the three mentioned categories, and on the distribution of funds between the individual applicants within one of the categories.Each category was assignedtwo groups of voters: A group of ‚Äòrandom‚Äô guest voters and a group of citizens.I was assigned to the group of citizens and requested to vote in the Governance Leadership category.The round also included a small additionalexperimenton the generation and use of impact attestations via Impact Garden. Iparticipatedand look forward to seeing what comes of it.Conflict of interestAs a pilot member of the Collective Feedback Commission (Introduction,retrospective) which applied for retrofunding in RPGF6, I was not able to serve as a reviewer in this round.The pilot CFC consisted of two subgroups - one for the Citizens House, and one for the Token House. Both groups applied separately. I have declared a conflict of interest with regard to the Citizens CFC application. I was asked to still vote on the Token House CFC application. To keep my bias in check, I decided to usethe Foundation‚Äôs budget for the next versionof the CFC as a guideline.Voting rationaleRound and category budgetsWhile governance is undoubtedly central to the value proposition of Optimism (along with the core technology of the OP Stack), we should strive to keep things real.After having looked through the applications in all three categories,I settled for a fairly modest total round budget of 1.5M OP, distributed as 50% for Infrastructure & Tooling, and 25% for each of the two other categories.There were relatively few elligible applications (88 across all three categories), and I found that a number of applications were low impact or not clearly impactful within the round scope. This impression seemed to be shared by some of the other voters (examples can be foundhereandhere).Among the high impact applicants, several seemed to be familiar faces who have been well supported in the past - be it through various proactive grants, retroactive governance rewards or rpgf.In the Governance Leadership category, in particular, there were many applications from core governance contributors (commissions, committees, boards, contribution paths), most of which already have agreed-upon budgets. In that particular scenario, I believe that rpgf should only be a supplement if there is clearly an outsized impact compared to the initial expectation - as for instance when a small experimental governance structure turns out to be a success, or when unforeseen events have required a massive extra effort.I think that it is important to not set up the expectation that retroactive public goods funding should be given as a bonus to anyone that performs a good job they were already paid to do.Retroactive public goods funding is a great as a way to reward impact that can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be planned. But commissioned work should result in a secure paycheck, not a lotto ticket (‚Äúyou can always apply for rpgf later‚Äù). Budgets and retroactive governance participation rewards should be fair and realistic, and those who propose or accept a budget should only do so if the terms are clear and satisfying. Otherwise, the result will be employers who are not willing to bear the risk of their business, and work-takers who do not feel responsible for reality-checking the promises and proposals they make.Project allocationsI allocated 0% to a few projects that I don‚Äôt consider to be part of Optimism‚Äôs governance.I also allocated 0% to the Anticapture Commission, as I believe that retroactive governance participation rewards for active delegates and members of the ACC (4000 + 4000 OPin Season 5, with an expectation of similar rewards in Season 6) is already more than fair.Furthermore, I allocated 0% to the Security Council because they are receiving non-disclosed funding from the Foundation which makes it impossible, at this time, to evaluate impact =?= profit. The specific case wasdiscussed at lengthin the citizens channel, and there was talk of either disclosing the Foundation funding or withdrawing the SC‚Äôs application, but to my knowledge neither happened.The SC is clearly very impactful and valuable, but the north star of rpgf is ‚Äúimpact = profit‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt see how we can take this seriously unless we insist on knowing what previous funding an applicant has already received from the Collective for the impact in question. There may be cases when it makes sense to pay undisclosed amounts to certain entities, but then those entities should not be allowed to also apply for rpgf.There were two very small individual projects in the category which I considered in scope. I allocated 0.5% to each of them.On the other end of the spectrum, I allocated 20% to theDeliberate Process on the definition of profit. This may be a controversial decision, but I really appreciated this initiative. It was a grassroot initiative in cooperation with the Foundation, and it encouraged in-person debate among a large group of citizens on what is arguable one of the most foundational definitions of retroactive public goods funding. I was genuinely sad to not be randomly selected to be part of this experiment, but I read all of thedocumentation, and I think thesubsequent discussionon the results clearly showed that there is a great need for deliberations such as this to show us what we don‚Äôt know.I allocated 5-15% to the rest of the applications in the Governance Leadership category, taking into account that many of these applicants were established structures with their own budgets, and that some projects had submitted separate applications for Season 5 and 6 (the rationale being that their membership and/or mandate had changed, which makes sense to me).Other notes on the voting processThevoting softwarewas basically the same as in Round 5. My only new observation is that it would be good to be able to edit your answers to the voting survey if you re-submit the ballot; your perceptions may have changed for the same reasons that made you want to change your allocation, and you probably ended up spending more time because of this.I spent about 10 hours in total on the voting, maybe a bit more, which I think is reasonable given the complexity of the task.I would love to see much more communication among citizens - and other stakeholders - in future rounds.In this round, the debate in the citizens channel actually picked up in the last week of voting, though almost exclusively concerning the Governance Leadership category. It seemed clear to me that this debate was very fruitful (I personally went back and substantially edited my allocations based on what I learned), and I have no doubt that similar discussions on the other categories would have been equally powerful. As I see it, this may well be the biggest unexplored potential in Optimism‚Äôs retroactive public goods funding so far.I have written more about thathere.(There may have been some impactful in-person discussions taking place at DevCon - I wouldn‚Äôt know, because I wasn‚Äôt there.)A few extra thoughts on the voting algorithmAdded as a comment below.","This report details the author's participation in Optimism's RPGF6, a retroactive public goods funding round allocating 1.1M-3.5M OP for governance contributions (October 2023 - September 18th, 2024).  As a citizen voter in the Governance Leadership category, the author advocated for a 1.5M OP total budget, prioritizing Infrastructure & Tooling.  They allocated funds based on demonstrable impact, rejecting applications lacking clear impact or those with existing funding.  The author highlighted the need for transparency in funding, particularly regarding the Security Council's undisclosed funding, and emphasized the importance of realistic budgeting and avoiding rpgf as a bonus for already-compensated work.  The author also praised the Deliberate Process initiative and suggested improvements to the voting software and inter-voter communication.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Retro Funding 4: Learnings and Reflections,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-learnings-and-reflections/9271,"Retro Funding is an economic flywheel that rewards positive impact to the Optimism Collective. The Collective is running Retro Funding as an ongoing experiment where insights and learnings from each round inform the design of future experiments. Below is a retrospective on one of our latest experiments.Round detailsVoting period: June 27th - July 11thReward amount: 10M OP, max reward per project 500,000 OP, minimum reward per project to be eligible was 1,000 OP.Impact period: October 1st, 2023 - May 31st, 2024Voting transparency: Votes were publicRetro Funding 4: Onchain buildersRetro Funding 4 rewarded onchain builders that deployed their own contracts on the Superchain. These builders play a crucial role in driving Superchain adoption and generating sequencer revenue. For this round, builders on Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, Metal, and OP mainnet were eligible.Results overview1265√ó394 29.2 KBStrong power law distribution: The top 20% of applicants received around 70% of OP rewards, which follows a power law distribution. The median project received 13K OP, which further demonstrated the shift towards a power law distribution compared to Retro Funding 3, where the median project received 45K OP.New builders: This round saw a significant influx of first time applicants, with 76% of projects participating in the Retro Funding program for the first time. In a survey among round recipients, 41% responded that they did not apply to previous rounds because they were unaware that Retro Funding rewarded onchain builders.Coverage: Retro Funding 4 rewarded ~20% of the Superchain‚Äôs onchain activity, achieving high coverage of overall activity. The remaining ~80% of Superchain activity is distributed as follows: ~10% of Superchain activity comes from large projects that did not apply, and the remaining ~70% comes from unknown projects, P2P transfers and more.Metrics-based voting: The experimentRetro Funding 4 experimented withMetrics-basedvoting, testing the hypothesis that by leveraging quantitative metrics, badgeholders are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors.1600√ó1126 210 KBVoter sentimentThe experiment received an overwhelmingly positive sentiment on the voter side, with surveyed badgeholders unanimously signaling that Retro Funding should run further experiments utilizing metrics-based voting.Badgeholders signaled that they found a metrics-based voting approach to be more accurate in determining impact, with 71% of surveyed badgeholders agreeing that metrics-based voting yielded more accurate measurements than the individual project reviews conducted in previous rounds. The average results satisfaction rating from badgeholders was 4.8 out of 7.‚ÄúMetrics-based impact is a tremendous achievement and I think these will be some of the best results ever! I have very high confidence in these results. I think future rounds will be even better, especially as the trusted user models improve.‚ÄùThe most prominent feedback on the metric-based voting approach was the lack of ‚Äúhuman touch.‚Äù Badgeholders wanted more human input to help interpret the raw onchain data and shape metrics to reward impact accurately.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we have all the formulas correct yet. But I think it‚Äôs much better to be allocating based on data that we collect, rather than trusting what is provided by individual projects. I feel that we must strive to independently verify data and easily identify ‚Äúgames‚Äù being played to skew metrics in their own favor.‚ÄùRecipient sentimentIn addition to being perceived as more accurate, metrics-based voting gave participating builders much higher predictability and transparency. While in previous rounds there was little visibility into how project impact was evaluated, this round provided a clear signal to builders on what was being prioritized and considered. In the post-round recipient survey, 60% of participants responded that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the round‚Äôs overall reward allocation, while 40% said they expected for their project to receive more rewards.Metric creation processBadgeholders shaped the creation and curation of impact metricsby participating in a workshop and multiple surveys. The opportunity to test the voting UI yielded even more feedback, ensuring the final metrics framework truly reflected the community‚Äôs values and preferences.The impact metric setup was led by OS Observer, which leveraged public datasets, meaning anyone can verify the integrity of the source data. All of the code poweringimpact metricsis open source, allowing anyone to audit the models and query logic. For each metric, you will find a detailed description and a link to its calculation within thevoting application.This process highlighted the importance of an iterative process to creating metrics. Only when badgeholders evaluated how different projects performed against certain metrics were they able to give feedback on how well a metric performed at achieving its goal.Enhancing metrics and balancing use casesBadgeholders flagged that a more balanced approach to metrics was needed, with concerns that overly simplistic metrics could be gamed. Solely relying on metrics such as gas fees or trusted users, could end up disproportionally rewarding projects that performed well on a single vector. Combining multiple qualitative and quantitative criteria for a single metric was a popular request, with one participant stating, ‚ÄúAny metric can be gameable; and sophistication needs to happen.‚Äù While this round focused on simple one-dimensional metrics, a new frontier is emerging withmetrics that express more comprehensive measurements of impact. Overall, however, badgeholders rated their confidence levels on Round 4‚Äôs impact metrics as 5 out of 7.Confidence in data sources and trust signals varied. On average, badgeholders rated clarity and transparency around the impact metrics 6/7. One participant stated, ‚ÄúFolks were generally happy with the metrics coverage,‚Äù but there‚Äôs room for improvement regarding both transparency and education.However, the resulting incentives of rewarding impact via a particular metric can be complex and therefore hard to grasp. For example, some badgeholders selected metrics that were on a logarithmic scale instead of linear. Discussions among badgeholders towards the end of the voting process highlighted that the implications of rewarding impact using a log scale was not clearly understood among voters.More in-depth analysis is necessary to understand the effect of rewarding impact via specific metrics. It‚Äôs questionable if the current structure involving many voters quickly choosing what they prefer reflects a sufficient level of analysis to set the right incentives.Trusted user model: Refinements and challengesThe trusted user model aimed at identifying addresses that are likely to belong to a real human. 10 out of the 16 impact metrics relied on the trusted user model. The trusted user model faced criticism for either being too narrow, excluding genuine real users, or being too broad, including users which could be bots.Some badgeholders wanted to see a trusted user model which was more inclusive, sharing that they think the criteria for ‚Äútrusted users‚Äù were too narrow and excluded many genuine users.‚ÄúMost users might not meet all these requirements, especially if we want to achieve mass adoption.‚ÄùOther badgeholders, however, were concerned criteria weren‚Äôt exclusionary enough. They worried the trusted user model still captured users which demonstrated bot or farming behavior.There is a tradeoff between a narrow model ‚Äì which has a high probability of only considering real humans while also excluding a lot of what could be real human users ‚Äì and a broad model, which would include a larger number of users that could include bots.For future iterations, a multitude of trusted user models that enable more customization could help badgeholders express what user behavior they deem impactful. Identifying sybil behavior among addresses has been a large focus within the broader industry, and while promising efforts have been made, it is unlikely a model will emerge which will not face a tradeoff between narrow and broad criteria.Challenges around account abstractionChallenges with the trusted user model were highlighted by projects which integrated account abstraction (ERC4337). The typical account abstraction user experience involves creating a new address for interacting with an application. This address usually has no reputation attached to it and is indistinguishable from bots or sybils. This resulted in most account abstraction transactions not meeting the requirements of the trusted user model. As account abstraction sees more adoption (leading users to not attach reputation to their addresses), it becomes questionable if trusted user models will remain valuable.Distribution curves & maximum rewardsOf the 12 unique metrics measured in this round, 4 were also provided on a logarithmic distribution curve. While logarithmic metrics were used significantly, they received mixed reviews.Distribution curves can allow badgeholders to set different incentives scales. A logarithmic curve can be perceived as harsh when evaluating impact, because it results in statements such as: A project with 1,000 transactions should receive half the rewards of a project with 10,000 transactions. This raised questions around fairness and it was unclear if the implications of selecting a logarithmic curve were obvious to voters.Further exploration of distribution curves could enable more nuanced decision-making.Open source multiplierBadgeholders had the option to add an ‚Äúopen source multiplier‚Äù to their ballot, which multiplied the rewards of projects that had an open source license within their code repo.Even though the open source multiplier had significant shortcomings, it remained popular with badgeholders: 80% of ballots included it.Finding an applicable rule-set for classifying a project as open source posed a significant challenge. The rule-set used for this round was as follows:The Github repo containing contract code must leverage an open source license, as defined by the Open Source Initiative, within their repo license.mdThe Github repo containing contract code had to be created and made public before May 1st, 2024.There was no requirement that solicited in-depth proof that the code in the Github repo provided was an exact match to the one deployed onchain. Furthermore, file licenses were not accounted for ‚Äì an individual file in a repo might have a license identifier, that is not open source, that overrides the repo license.Of the 94 projects which qualified for the open source multiplier,an audit by Bixbite and the Velodrome teamidentified 20 issues.5 projects had not verified their contracts via a blockexplorer, making it impossible to verify that the code within the relevant Github repo matched the onchain contracts.13 projects had one or multiple files within their repo with conflicting licenses.2 projects did not have their full contract code within their Github repository.At scale, it becomes unviable to audit each project‚Äôs code within the onchain builder round: It is necessary to develop a scalable methodology to identify open source projects.‚ÄúI believe there should be some reward here, but I‚Äôm yet unconvinced the framework we have for it is perfect.‚ÄùRewarding impact retroactivelyThe goal of retroactively rewarding impact instead of proactively rewarding projects based on their future promises was underscored throughout the entire round 4 voting and evaluation process. One badgeholder noted, ‚Äú[Retro Funding is] about rewarding impact directly, not rewarding the little guy.‚ÄùIn this round, badgeholders did not have the opportunity to designate outsized rewards to projects that are ‚Äúin need of rewards,‚Äù or ‚Äúare just getting started.‚Äù The fact this topic came up within Retro Funding‚Äôs fourth iteration demonstrates how hard it is to align all voters on a retroactive rewards model.Voting experienceThe voting experience has seen strong improvements round over round, with badgeholders rating Round 4‚Äôs voting experience at 8/10, compared to 6/10 in Round 3.Voting required significantly less time than in previous rounds as well, with badgeholders spending an average of 2 hours on voting in Round 4, compared to 16 hours in Round 3.Some badgeholders suggested that showcasing project performance against metrics created a biased voting experience, where voters could reverse engineer a ballot to reward the projects they preferred. On the flipside, some voters voiced that measuring the performance of different projects against metrics gave them relevant insights into raw metric quality. Check outa deep dive on the badgeholder voting behavior, created by OpenSource Observer.Sign up experienceRound 4 featured a narrow scope with explicit eligibility criteria. A significant share of applicants, around 40%, did not meet the requirements, and therefore were not eligible for rewards. Applicants could not easily verify if they met the eligibility criteria, which led to significant frustration with the process.Contract attributionsWhen applying, builders had to prove they deployed the contracts they submitted. This involved having builders sign a message using the contract‚Äôs deployer address. ‚ÄùDownstream contracts‚Äù were considered as well, which involved builders claiming factory contracts and receiving attribution for contracts deployed by the factory.Some builders voiced concerns with this model. On one side, NFT creators who use platforms like Zora and Sound.xyz were not able to claim their NFTs as their contracts, as these are attributed to Zora‚Äôs/Sound‚Äôs factory contracts. However, both Zora and Sound.xyz forwarded a portion of their rewards to creators.Builders that issue transactions on behalf of their users, a popular model for Farcaster Frames, also faced challenges with contract attributions, as their contracts did not meet the minimum requirement for unique address interactions. While unfortunate, there is no current methodology for easily verifying that the transactions were initiated by unique users.As frontends and interfaces evolve, and as protocols become more modular, builders might increasingly start leveraging onchain contracts they do not own. The Optimism Collective should explore how it can reward user interfaces for their impact.Resulting workstreamsThis round has surfaced different workstreams necessary to improve impact measurement for future onchain builder rounds. Based on the feedback outlined above, we want to answer the following questions in our research:Humans in-the-loop: How might we leverage subjective human input to improve metrics? How can we align raw onchain data with subjective, qualitative evaluation?Trusted user models: How might we iterate on the trusted user model to serve different needs? What is the most appropriate balance between the narrow and broad scopes discussed above?EIP4337: How might we support transactions within the account abstraction value chain?Contract attribution & ownership verification: How might we upgrade our contract attribution and ownership verification to keep up with industry innovations?Dapps & frontends: How might we measure the impact of interfaces which allow users to interact with onchain applications?Open source classifier: How might we accurately classify contract code as open source? How might we measure the impact of open source contract code?Final thoughtsThrough this fourth round of Retro Funding, we were able to test the efficacy of quantitative impact measurement data in increasing voting accuracy and transparency. This first round showed the promise of this approach while it surfaced many shortcomings that will lead to more accurate impact measurement in the futureStay up to date on Retro Funding and participate in discussions on round experiments and more through theOptimism Governance forum. We look forward to continuous iteration and improvement!As always,Stay Optimistic!","Retro Funding 4, allocating 10M OP to on-chain builders on Optimism's Superchain (June 27th - July 11th, impact period: October 1st, 2023 - May 31st, 2024), experimented with metrics-based voting.  While the top 20% received 70% of rewards, showcasing a power law distribution, 76% of applicants were first-timers.  The metrics-based approach, though praised for accuracy and transparency by badgeholders (4.8/7 satisfaction), highlighted challenges:  imperfect trusted user models, difficulties with account abstraction and open-source classification, and the need for a more nuanced approach to metric weighting and interpretation.  Future iterations will focus on incorporating human input, refining the trusted user model, and addressing these identified limitations to improve impact measurement and reward allocation.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Appeal to the Optimism Foundation: Request to Update RetroFunding Round 6 Application,https://gov.optimism.io/t/appeal-to-the-optimism-foundation-request-to-update-retrofunding-round-6-application/9208,"Hi@Jonas,@op_julian,@system,I‚Äôm reaching out regarding three declined RetroFunding Round 6 applications that represent essential impact from our development and events teams. These applications were mistakenly perceived as duplicates by reviewers, despite their distinct contributions.While our Optimism Fractal Respect Game Eventsapplicationwas approved, the current outcome means most of our contributors‚Äô significant impact over the past year would go unrecognized. This is particularly concerning because the approved application explicitly excludes these other contributions.The approved application specifically states, ‚ÄúIt does not include the development of tools used at the events or the Optimism Town Hall events which take place after Respect Game events, as there are separate applications for these projects.‚Äù As a result, these vital contributions are now at risk of not being recognized at all.ContextAs leader of two teams focused on Optimism governance, I‚Äôve coordinated both technical development and event facilitation over the past year. This represents substantial impact from:A technical team with one full-time and three part-time developers who have built governance infrastructure that is not currently being recognizedAn events team with two full-time and two part-time contributors who have hosted ~60 governance events that are not currently being recognizedMultiple contributors who have worked almost exclusively on Optimism over the past year to create critical infrastructure and processes for the CollectiveOur request is crucial not only for our teams - whose continued ability to support the Collective depends substantially on RetroFunding - but also for the Collective itself, as our tools and events provide essential infrastructure for improving governance processes. Our experience offers the Collective an opportunity to become more supportive of novel governance approaches while improving RetroFunding‚Äôs inclusivity and effectiveness. This aligns directly with the Collective‚Äôs core axiom of rewarding impact with profit and building more equitable systems.RequestTheApplication Review Processstates ‚ÄúThe Foundation decides which applications are allowed to be edited.‚Äù Through this provision, I respectfully request permission to:Update our approved Optimism Fractal Respect Games Events application to include contributions from the declined applicationsRename it to ‚ÄúOptimism Fractal Respect Games + Optimystics Tools and Events‚ÄùThis request is straightforward because:The Optimism Fractal Respect Games application was already approved with unanimous supportChanges align with the Collective‚Äôs mission to reward impactBadgeholders would gain a complete picture for evaluationI‚Äôve already begun drafting the combined application to ensure a smooth update if approved. The three projects that I‚Äôd like to add into the approved application areOptimystics Tools,Eden Fractal Events, andOptimism Town Hall + RetroPitches.Understanding Our AppealWhile approving this request should be straightforward based on the reasons above, I‚Äôve prepared detailed documentation that provides valuable context both for this specific appeal and for improving future RetroFunding rounds. The document, titledRecognizing Impact in RetroFunding: Round 6 Appeal and Process Insights, examines:Impact of Structural Changes:How RetroFunding Round 6 design modifications affect evaluation of diverse, high-impact contributionsSupporting Teams and Contributors:Overview of the technical and events teams driving governance innovationExcluded Project Contributions:Analysis of how the approved application explicitly excludes key technical and community contributionsReview Process Challenges:Documentation of reviewers‚Äô misunderstanding the application review process rules/procedures, impact assessment, and technical issuesCritical Recognition of Community Contributions:Why proper evaluation supports both team sustainability and Collective growthBenefits for the Collective:How this appeal advances both immediate fairness and long-term governance evolutionIn addition, the documentation includes comprehensive links to each project‚Äôs applications, impact pages, and prior appeals, clearly demonstrating significant verifiable impact through metrics and community feedback. Despite this demonstrated impact and thousands of hours of critical work specifically for Optimism Governance, all the members of our teams have collectively received only a modest 30,000 OP from Optimism in total (during RetroPGF Round 3).This documentation provides both important context about our contributors‚Äô work and concrete insights for enhancing how the Collective recognizes and rewards impact. I encourage Foundation members and anyone interested in improving RetroFunding‚Äôs impact evaluation processes to review these materials.Timing and Next StepsWhile voting has now begun, most reviewers have not yet cast their votes. Approving this update would enable proper evaluation of our contributors‚Äô complete impact during the remainder of the two-week voting period.We would greatly appreciate if you could approve this request to ensure reviewers can fully understand and evaluate our work. If a complete update isn‚Äôt possible, even removing the sentence that explicitly excludes other contributions would help prevent misunderstanding and enable more accurate evaluation.I‚Äôm happy to provide any additional context needed or discuss alternative approaches to ensure fair consideration of this work. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this request.Note:This post has been updated to reflect current timing (now that voting has begun) and provide important clarifications about our contributors‚Äô work and impact. Over the past few days I‚Äôve also significantly expanded the accompanyingRecognizing Impact in RetroFunding Round 6documentation with enhanced analysis and process insights.For an overview of recent updates, please seehere. Your consideration of this request is greatly appreciated.","Three crucial Optimism governance applications were mistakenly declined as duplicates.  These applications, representing a year's work by two teams (technical and events), built vital infrastructure and hosted numerous events.  While one application was approved, it explicitly excluded the others, jeopardizing recognition for significant contributions (approx. 30,000 OP received previously).  The author requests permission to update the approved application to include the declined ones, ensuring fair evaluation of their substantial impact on Optimism's governance.  Detailed documentation supporting this request, highlighting process improvements and impact assessment, is provided.  Approval is sought before voting concludes to enable full consideration of their collective work.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Recognizing Impact: Critical Context for RetroFunding Reviewers and Governance Participants,https://gov.optimism.io/t/recognizing-impact-critical-context-for-retrofunding-reviewers-and-governance-participants/9263,"image1920√ó548 50.3 KBUrgent Context & RequestWe request your urgent attention regarding critical governance infrastructure and contributions that deserve recognition in RetroFunding Round 6 - both for immediate evaluation and to strengthen future rounds.While our Optimism Fractal Respect Game Events application was approved in RetroFunding Round 6, three complementary projects that created distinct, verifiable impact were mistakenly declined as duplicates. These essential contributions risk going unrecognized due to round design changes, technical issues during review, limited awareness of the novel governance processes we‚Äôre pioneering, and several other factors detailed in ourAppeal to the Foundationand detaileddocumentationabout Recognizing Impact in RetroFunding Round 6 .Team Impact & InnovationThese projects represent the work of dedicated events and development teams - three full-time contributors working exclusively on Optimism for over a year, plus three additional contributors dedicating several months each. Together, they‚Äôve created proven systems for democratic scaling, built essential reputation infrastructure, and fostered critical collaborations across the Superchain. Through hundreds of onchain attestations and extensive engagement from delegates, council members, and builders, these initiatives have demonstrated significant value for the Collective‚Äôs governance processes.Recognition & Path ForwardDespite providing comprehensive documentation during initial review and detailed appeals, most of our team‚Äôs contributions remain excluded from recognition in Round 6- including technical infrastructure and our team‚Äôs other events that are explicitly excluded from the approved application. This situation impacts not only our team‚Äôs ability to sustainably build critical infrastructure, but also affects the Collective‚Äôs capacity to properly recognize and reward demonstrated impact. There are two paths forward:With less than one day remaining in Round 6 voting, badge holders and guest reviewers can support all four projects by recognizing their comprehensive impact through theOptimism Fractal Respect Game Events application.For governance participants reviewing this documentation at any time, these experiences provide valuable insights for improving RetroFunding‚Äôs ability to recognize demonstrated impact, achieve its core axiom of impact=profit, and help summon Ether‚Äôs Phoenix.We greatly appreciate badge holders and reviewers who take time to carefully evaluate these contributions, as well as governance participants engaging with this documentation to help strengthen RetroFunding‚Äôs recognition processes.

After two straightforward and enjoyable Zoom meetings, we learned about the requirements and tools for the voting process.As an invited voter, I was assigned one of three categories and given an adjustable budget for my task. My category wasGovernance Leadership, with a dynamic budget ranging from 1.1M to 3.5M OP. I chose a budget of 2.7M OP to allocate as follows:40% to Governance Infrastructure & Tooling30% to Governance Analytics30% to Governance Leadership (my assigned voting category, covering 20 projects)I delegated the other two categories to different users with voting power in those areas.With this set, I started with a general first-round voting phase using pairwise comparison. The AI summary of each project was a huge help, as it gave me an overview and allowed me to set up my initial voting phase.Once that was done, I went toround6.optimism.ioto see the token distributions and began the second voting phase: analyzing each project individually to understand its structure, governance, and impact on the superchain and community.In the Telegram group created for voters to share ideas and feedback, many invited voters agreed on the principle ofimpact = profitfor allocating token percentages to each project. We also noticed that some projects had both Season 5 and Season 6 proposals in the same category, so I decided to allocate zero tokens to Season 5 proposals. This reduced my voting allocation to 15 projects, and I then manually adjusted part of the budget to reach 100%.My personal analysis focused on several factors, primarily the project‚Äôs impact. However, I also considered what is needed, from my perspective, to maintain transparent governance, foster project development, and adapt to the community to make superchain adoption easier. In summary:Ecosystem Impact + Project Development + Social AdoptionEach of these elements is essential for governance development. Leading governance requires transparency, a code of conduct, technical and social development, and best practices in every area mentioned.These were the criteria that guided my voting. I‚Äôd like to wait for the final results before sharing more details.If you made it this far‚Äîthank you for your time!Best,David(Follow me on warpcast)RetroFunding_R6_IVoted384√ó216 17.9 KB","This report details a voter's experience in Optimism's RetroFunding Round 6.  Selected randomly, the voter (David) was assigned the Governance Leadership category with a 2.7M OP budget.  Allocation prioritized Governance Infrastructure & Tooling, Governance Analytics, and selected projects within their category, guided by principles of ecosystem impact, project development, and community adoption.  Pairwise comparison and individual project analysis, informed by AI summaries and peer discussion, shaped the voting process.  Season 5 proposals were excluded, focusing allocation on 15 Season 6 projects.

We imagine a future in which Optimism core development, governance contributions, developer tooling, onchain applications, and more, are sustainably rewarded for the impact they provide to the Optimism Collective.Retro Funding 6 rewards contributors to contributions to Optimism Governance, including governance infrastructure & tooling, governance analytics, and governance leadership. Impact generated between October 2023 - September 18th 2024 will be rewarded. You can find the full details of the round‚Äôs design and its componentshere.VotingVoting apphereThe thesis behind this Retro Funding voting design is that sorting voters into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications will lead to an improved voter experience and allocation of rewards, compared to past rounds.Voting on BudgetAs a voter in Retro Funding 6, you are tasked with deciding the overall token allocation for the round, as well as determining how rewards should be allocated across the three scope categories.Round allocation: You will vote on the total amount of OP to be allocated for the round, within the Foundation‚Äôs set range of 1M to 3.5M OP. Choose an amount that you believefairly reflects the impact of the projects in this round. The final round allocation will be determined by taking the median of all votes.Category allocation: You will also vote on the percentage of OP that should be allocated to each of the three categories. This allocation should represent the impact of projects within each category. The final category allocation will be determined by taking the median of all votes and normalizing results.You can change your votes at any point before submitting your ballot. Your votes on round allocation and category allocation will be public.Voting on ProjectsYou have been randomly assigned to evaluate projects within one of the three categories. You can check the category you‚Äôve been assigned on the ballot page.Rate projects: To unlock your ballot, you must first rate each project on a scale from low impact to high impact.Declare Conflicts of Interests: If you have a Conflict of Interest with any project, you are required to declare it. You will then be excluded from voting on that specific project. A Conflict of Interest is defined as an organization where you expect any portion of funds to flow to yourself or any projects from which you derive income. More information can be found in theSelf-dealing policy.Rank Projects: After rating, you‚Äôll see a preliminary ranking of projects based on their impact. You can adjust this ranking to ensure it accurately reflects your preferences.Allocate rewards:You can then allocate a percentage of rewards to each project, either by selecting one of the suggested allocation methods or by creating a custom allocation. Note that your reward allocation will remain private.You can find a walkthrough of voting functionalityhereThe final project allocation will be determined by taking the median to all votes and normalizing results.Useful ToolsPairwise: Pairwise is a fun voting option to gamify and simplify the decision making process, allowing Badgeholders to create their ballot by comparing projects.Impact Garden: Impact Garden is a protocol designed to generate reputation based onchain impact data to improve funding allocation for public goods.DeVouch: Signal your support for legitimate projects applying for Retro Funding rounds or flag suspicious ones using on-chain attestations.**Retrolist.app&Retropgfhub.com**: Browse all projects which applied to the roundImpact = ProfitRetro Funding‚Äôs purpose is to reward projects for the impact they have created for the Optimism Collective. Following the axiom of ‚Äúimpact = profit‚Äù, the Collective believes in fairly rewarding each contributor for the impact they have provided. In no way does Retro Funding reward expected future work or impact of projects, it‚Äôs only concerned with retroactively rewarding the impact that has already been created.Within this round, you will find information on the Optimism grants projects have received since January 2023 and investment, defined as ‚Äúfunding provided by individuals or investment firms in exchange for equity ownership‚Äù, since Jan 2020. In addition, there‚Äôs information on the pricing model of a project to gain insights into their business model. The Foundation believes that venture funding should not be a factor when evaluating a project‚Äôs impact. In fact, theoriginal vision of Retroactive Public Goods Fundingencourages the development of a venture capital market specifically for public goods. You can read more about this topichere.Voter Selection ExperimentRetro Funding Round 6 introduces a new approach to voter selection, with Guest Voters chosen randomly from the broader community. Two primary research questions guide this experiment: whether selection methods, such as Web of Trust or Proof of Work, yield voter groups with distinct characteristics compared to random selection, and whether these methods influence voting outcomes in resource allocation. Approximately 80 Guest Voters will participate, and their aggregated voting impact may be adjusted by Citizens to prevent system capture. This research will help optimize future selection processes for a more representative governance structure.Self-dealing & Bribery policyVoters shouldnot vote for organizations where they expect any portion of funds to flow to them or any projects from which they derive income.Voters will need to disclose their conflict of interest during their review of projects in the voting process. For each project they review, badgeholders will see the option to disclose a Conflict of Interest. Projects for which a badgeholder has disclosed a Conflict of Interest will be removed from the badgeholders ballot. Any voter can vote on the Round allocation and category allocation, independent of conflicts of interests relating to individual projects. Conflict of Interest disclosures will be public. See theRetro Funding: Self-Dealing Policyfor more details.Voters shouldrefrain from engaging in bribery. Please review theRetro Funding 6 Bribery PolicyFAQ[TO BE ADDED]Made with <3 by Gitcoin, Agora, OS Observer and Optimism Foundation.","Optimism Collective's Retro Funding Round 6 (October 31st - November 13th, 18:00 UTC) allocates 1M-3.5M OP to reward contributors' impact (October 2023 - September 18th, 2024) on Optimism governance.  Badgeholders and guest voters (approx. 80) will allocate funds across three categories, with a maximum of 12.5% per project (minimum 1000 OP).  Round and category allocations are public; project votes are private.  Voters rate projects, declare conflicts of interest, and allocate rewards.  This round experiments with random voter selection, aiming to improve future governance representation and resource allocation.  Impact, not venture funding, determines reward allocation.

We must continue to iterate and experiment.Liquid Democracy is clearly a potential path to fix this. Instead of having one delegate for everything, you choose a delegate based on the topic, and if they don‚Äôt feel informed on a decision, they can delegate all the voting power they have to someone else.Help us move closer to making this potentially game changing DAO technology a reality by participating in Pairwise‚Äôs Retro Funding 6 experiment!

This experiment allows community members to delegate votes on project funding across three categories. Voting power is tiered based on OP holdings, with World ID boosting rank.  While the official vote determines funding, the liquid democracy experiment, though not awarding OP, aims to improve DAO governance by enabling broader, topic-specific participation and delegation.  Pseudonymous voting is employed for this round, though future iterations aim for complete anonymity.  Community participation is crucial for advancing this innovative voting technology.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Retro Funding 6: Bribery Policy,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-6-bribery-policy/9175,"It is expected thatOptimistsrefrain from self-dealing. While opportunities for self-dealing in the Citizens‚Äô House will be reduced via incentive design and voting mechanisms, the Foundation may implement additional measure to discourage self-dealing, to be defined at the beginning of each Round, while these mechanisms are further developed.The Foundation has defined the below process to address bribery, if needed.Over time, the consequences for bribery and other forms of self-dealing will be determined by the Citizens‚Äô House and enforced via governance managed Citizenship Criteria.Round 6 Anti-Bribery PolicyReportingYou may report any verifiable instance of bribery using the form linkedhere. All discussions and reports should be in accordance with theRules of Engagement.As onchain evidence of bribery is unlikely, three separate reports against the same briber (or directly affiliated party) will need to be filed for a case to be considered valid. This number is based upon the number of people required for a bribe have a meaningful impact on results and considering the potential disruption of false reports.EnforcementIn the event 3 separate reports are filed, and the briber is another badgeholder, the bribing badgeholder will receive an attestation and be prohibited from participating in Season 6.In the event 3 separate reports are filed, and the briber is a project, the project will receive an attestation and be removed from the Round (ineligible to receive rewards in Round 6).In the event any report is found to be invalid, the badgeholder will receive an attestation and will be ineligible to receive retroactive governance participant rewards for Round 6.Please note: In the future, governance will decide the set of attestations that permit or prohibit Citizenship.Subject to Citizens‚Äô House ApprovalBefore any enforcement action is taken, the Foundation must post a proposal summarizing the reported bribery incident and corresponding enforcement actions. The Citizens‚Äô House will then have one week to veto any enforcement decisions proposed by the Foundation. If an enforcement action suggested by the Foundation is veto‚Äôd, no enforcement action will take place. New reports filed about the same instance will not be re-considered.","To curb self-dealing in the Citizens' House,  incentives and voting mechanisms are in place, with additional measures to be defined each round.  A three-report threshold triggers an anti-bribery process:  three separate reports against the same individual or project are required for investigation.  Confirmed bribery results in attestations and penalties, including participation bans (badgeholders) or project removal (projects).  The Foundation proposes enforcement, subject to a one-week veto period by the Citizens' House.  False reporting also incurs penalties.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Upcoming Retro rounds and their design,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861,"Based on Round 3 learnings, Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) is transitioning from broad scoped rounds to more narrowly scoped rounds; you can find out more about this transitionhere.To provide more transparency into the Retro Funding design process, in line withOptimism‚Äôs path towards Open Metagovernance, we‚Äôre sharing plans and considerations for Retro rounds for all of 2024. You can find the announcement of upcoming roundshere.Scoping & Sizing retro roundsScoping retro roundsThe scope of a retro roundoutlines the type of impact that is being rewarded.Feedback from Retro Funding 3suggests that narrowly scoped rounds can lead to significant improvements of the builder and voter experience. In scoping retro rounds in 2024, the Foundation aimed to identify the types of contributions which are most impactful to the Collective and where Retro Funding is best suited to support. The detailed scope of each retro round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.Sizing retro roundsThe aim for sizing round rewards is to provide OP rewards which accurately reflect the impact within the scope of a retro round and provide a strong incentive for contributing to the Collective. The amount of rewards for each round will be announced 8-12 weeks before its start.The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 & 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 & 7 to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, the goal for this process will be to gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons.Citizen workloadWhile the number of retro rounds is increasing, the goal is for individual citizen workload to not increase and possibly be reduced. In previous retro rounds, citizens‚Äô provided feedback on the time intensive labor of participating and shared concerns that increasing the number of rounds will increase the required time commitment of individual citizens. Retro Funding is actively exploring designs & experiments which enable an increase in the number of rounds while not impacting individual citizens workload.More rounds, more experimentsRunning multiple types of rounds allows us to run different experiments on the best ways to scale and improve Retro Funding. Below you find an overview of the experiments planned for 2024.Measuring impactOne of the obstacles citizens faced in Retro Funding 3was the challenge of evaluating different types of impact using the same approach. Not all impact is the same, and different types of impact are best measured via different approaches. Below you find a summary of the framework which the Foundation applies to explore appropriate approaches to measuring different types of impact.Contributions to Optimism can be categorized as either upstream or downstream of Optimism blockspace.Upstream contributions improve Optimism itself, this includes improvements to the OP Stack and Optimism GovernanceDownstream contributions improve the experience of Optimism users, such as builders and consumers.Untitled5085√ó776 167 KBUpstream impact is measured via the aggregate utility of Optimism usersTo evaluate impact which is upstream, we need to understand how the contribution has increased the aggregate utility of all users of the Optimism Platform. With the goal of understanding how a particular contribution has increased the aggregate usefulness of the Optimism Platform. Measuring this utility, and proving causality, poses a significant challenge.Example: how do you measure the impact of a particular protocol update of the OP stack?Downstream impact is measured via the utility derived by individual Optimism usersTo evaluate impact which is downstream, we can gather and analyse signals from individual users which express the utility derived from a contribution. E.g., how has the contribution benefited builders and consumers?Gathering and analysing these signals presents significant challenges, such as sybil resistance and vanity metrics.Example: seedownstream impact, a metric in which dev libraries are evaluated based on the output of the builders on Optimism which use themUpcoming Retro Funding experiments are designed to best address the different nature of upstream and downstream impact:Experiment 1: Impact JuriesThesis#1:By sorting badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications, impact measurement is improved.Thesis#2: Sortition, the selection of public jurors by using a random representative sample, allows us to effectively scale citizenshipIn Retro Funding 3, citizensrequested a more focused evaluation experience. Sorting citizens and projects into groups has been a popular suggested solution. Impact Juries will be used to reward upstream impact, as this category can benefit from a qualitative approach to measuring impact.Experiment 2:Metrics-based EvaluationThesis#3: By leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual projects.In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders voiced that non-standardized impact metrics added difficulty to the voting process and expressed desire to directly vote based on metrics. Examples of this approach include Buidl Guidl‚Äôsimpact calculatorand OpenSource Observersimpact vectors. Metrics-based evaluation will be used to reward downstream impact, as this category can benefit from a quantitive approach to measuring impact.Upcoming Retro RoundsUntitled 11501√ó800 75.1 KBRetro Funding 4: Onchain BuildersUntitled 2900√ó400 165 KBScope: Reward onchain builders for driving the adoption of OptimismTimeline: May 2024Impact category: downstreamExperiment: Metrics-based evaluationThe Collective is focused on growing the number ofactive onchain builders. Onchain builders introduce new users to Optimism, drive protocol usage and network effects. In the Superchain vision, onboarding a new user to an OP chain benefits the Collective as a whole. By rewarding these contributions, Retro Funding can further differentiate Optimism‚Äôs offering for developers in the highly competitive market of EVM blockspace.

The Collective can still support these contributions viaToken House Missions.Whats next?For each retro round more details on scope, timeline and governance design will follow. As, always, these considerations will be shared with the community for feedback as well as with theFeedback Commission.","Optimism's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) shifts from broad to narrowly scoped rounds in 2024, focusing on impactful contributions.  Four rounds are planned:  Retro Funding 4 (onchain builders, downstream impact, metrics-based evaluation), 5 (OP Stack, upstream, impact juries), 6 (governance, upstream, impact juries), and 7 (developer tooling, downstream, metrics-based evaluation).  The aim is to reduce citizen workload while experimenting with impact measurement (upstream via aggregate user utility, downstream via user feedback) and evaluation methods (impact juries and metrics-based).  Contributions outside the scope may be supported through Token House Missions.  Specific details for each round will be announced 8-12 weeks prior to launch.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Retro Funding 6: Impact Attestation experiment,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-6-impact-attestation-experiment/8982,"A reoccurring request by badgeholders has been to access more third party data on projects‚Äô impact, instead of solely relying on information projects have provided themselves. For many offchain contributions, we‚Äôre missing standardized reliable data which can be surfaced to measure impact. The hypothesis behind this small-scale experiment is that attestations by governance actors on the impact of Governance Infrastructure & Tooling projects will support badgeholders in making more informed voting decisions in Retro Funding 6.OverviewIn Retro Funding 6, the Collective will experiment with collecting data on the impact of different governance contributions via attestations. The goal is to produce standardized verifiable data which provides value to badgeholders.Timeline: Impact Attestations will be collected from Oct 14th til Oct 23rdScope Categories:Impact attestations as part of this experiment are limited to contributions within the ‚ÄúGovernance Infrastructure & Tooling‚Äù category.Participation: Top 100 Delegates,  Citizens and  governance leadership functions will be asked to participate in issuing impact attestations. It‚Äôs essential that participants use addresses which hold relevant reputation, such as delegate or citizen role. For the output of this process to be meaningful, the experiment should have participation from at least 40 Citizens, 40 Top 100 delegates, and various governance leadership functions. Participants should not attest to the impact of their own projects.Experiment OutputThe aim of the experiment is to generate relevant insights about the impact of Governance Infrastructure and Tooling to support the Retro Funding 6 voting process. Insights derived from the attestation data will be served to existing badgeholders on the relevant project page. These insights will not be surfaced to guest voters, to not impact the experiment conditions of thevoter selectionexperiment. You can see an early iteration on how this information could be surfaced to badgeholders below.image1440√ó1984 139 KBTo measure the success of the experiment, badgeholders will be asked to rate the value this information provided in the ballot submission survey.Issuing Impact Attestations via Impact GardenUsers will be able to generate Impact Attestations via Impact Garden to ensure the data gathered is standardized and enables comparison. Impact Garden‚Äôs work has significantly shaped the design of this experiment, you can read more about ithere.Impact Attestations have two core components:ReputationQualitative data standardizationReputationFarcaster account: we will leverage the Farcaster account of the rater to identify their roles within the Optimism Collective, both past and present. This is done by querying all attestations issued to any of their verified wallets.Bonus: Using the Farcaster username reduces the possibility for sybil attacks as we can leverage the social graph and information of the attestors, while creating a loop in which we enrich that same social graph with information on governance participation.Onchain attestations: Each Impact Attestation will reference the project being attested to onchain. By doing so, we continue to increase the onchain information available on the reputation of contributors to the Optimism Collective.Qualitative data standardizationEvery reviewer will be asked to answer 3 questions to ensure their views can be aggregated and analyzed in a comparable way. Measuring these metrics over time will also enable us to identify if the tool has improved or decayed and the continued relevance of it to the members of the Collective.Q1. How likely are you to recommend this tool to someone in your role or position?This question is akin to the Net Promoter Score measurement, through it we‚Äôre looking to understand how satisfied members of the Collective are with this tool and the service it has provided them with in the past. We hope that this question will also provide insights into the usefulness of a tool beyond the dependency it has for our systems.Q2.  How would you feel if this contribution ceased to exist?Through this question, we look to understand the dependency governance members of the collective have to these different tools to perform their day to day functions, or their role specific functions (Retro voting, etc).Q3. Brief explanation for your ratingWe have included an open ended question to allow raters to share additional valuable information on their answers to question 1 and 2. This information can surface particular benefits that have been derived and allow for more precise tuning for voters decisions.Simple vs complex impact relationshipsGovernance infrastructure & Tooling projects are a good fit for this experiment, as these projects usually have a direct user relationship, which can represent their impact. One can measure the impact of a governance tool by understanding how much utility it has provided to actors within the governance system.This is not true for all governance contributions. Measuring the impact of a Council, such as the Grants Council, is more complex, requiring multiple types of data that increase the complexity of the experiment.A look forwardThis experiment marks a first step into the frontier of generating standardized data to measure the impact of offchain projects. Below are principals which guide the experiment and possible future iterations:Rich reputation graph: It is essentially to understand who the users are that are deriving impact from a project and what their role is within the Optimism Collective. This requires the population of a rich reputation graph. The Collective already has madesignificant progress within this area, issuing attestations for relevant governance roles and building out builder information withinOP Atlas.Broad participation: For the collected data to be high signal, reliable, and robust, the process requires broad participation of actors within the Collective.Integrated: signals on impact, such as impact attestations, should become integrated into the experience of using a project, rather than being an activity in itself. At its best, the user is not required to take any additional actions to signal impact. This aids in ensuring broad participation and even coverage.","This experiment aims to improve Optimism Collective's Retro Funding process by gathering standardized data on the impact of governance infrastructure and tooling projects.  Top delegates, citizens, and leadership will attest to project impact via Impact Garden, answering three questions assessing usefulness and dependency.  This data, visible to badgeholders (but not guest voters), will inform Retro Funding 6 voting.  The experiment's success will be measured by badgeholder feedback on the information's value.  Future iterations aim for broader participation and integrated impact signaling, building a richer reputation graph within the Optimism Collective.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Retro Funding 5: Application Form Changes,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-application-form-changes/8743,"This post outlines the changes and updates which are being made toOP Atlasin preparation forRetro Funding 5.The infrastructure for the application process is created and hosted by Agora, you can find the relevant codehere.TimelineSign up: Aug 22nd - Sept 5thApplication Review Process: Sept 6th - Sept 20thVoting: September 21st - Oct 4thResults & Grant delivery: October 10thOrganizationsIn previous Retro Funding rounds, we‚Äôve seen that individual applications are often overloaded with many different types of projects. For example, inRetro Funding 3‚Ä¶Test-in-Prodapplied with 5 distinct projects, ranging from work on OP Stack client implementations to data analytics work.Department of Decentralizationapplied both with their work on conferences and hackathons, such as ETHBerlin and Protocol Berg, as well their work on the Goerli Testnetwork.This mixture of substantially different projects in a single application adds difficulty to the voting process. It makes comparisons among applications harder and increases the complexity of voting.Organizations aim to solve this problem.An organization is a new entity within OP Atlas that reflects a company, DAO or team which is working together. Each organization can create one or multiple projects that reflect distinct products, services, or contributions.Organization: Team, DAO, or business working together on one or multiple projectsProject:A distinct product, service, or contribution that reflects a significant amount of workWhat should not be a project:Individual activities within a larger project, such as a commit, a contract deployment on a new chain, a single call or presentation.With Organizations, Test-in-Prod can represent itself as a team, and then create distinct projects with which they want to apply to Retro Funding. Each project will then be judged separately within the relevant retro round.While in some cases creating an organization is helpful, projects do not need to be associated to an organization. For example, individuals building things by themselves can simply create a project and submit it for Retro Funding consideration. Groups of people who worked together on a single project, for example as part of a hackathon, may also choose not to create an organization. Creating the right framework for organizations and projects remains a challenge that we‚Äôll continue to iterate on, and we appreciate your feedback.Application QuestionsAs a continuation of the involvement of badgeholders in the design process of Retro Funding rounds, the Foundationhosted a workshopwith the aim of refining the project application form to collect more insightful information for the Retro Funding 5 voting process. The workshop provided valuable insights into the kinds of questions and answers that will help badgeholders better evaluate projects impact across thethree scope categories.Workshop Outcomes:Refined Questions for Impact Evaluation:Through group discussions, we identified key questions that should be included in the project application form to help badgeholders assess impact more effectively. For instance, we determined that for Ethereum Core Contributions, it‚Äôs crucial to ask questions that clarify how a project supports or is a dependency of the OP Stack. Important feedback has been the desire to have more verifiable information about projects impact, instead of self-reported statements,  user testimonials were  highlighted as anexample of this.Targeted Asks:The workshop also shed light on the nature of the data submitted for the different categories through an exercise of evaluating the answers received in Retro Funding 3. A more focused set of questions, anchored in tangible, specific impact related proof were brought forward to avoid broad, or at times unrelated, information being submitted by projects.We collated the most effective questions that emerged from each group discussion per category and sent out a survey to the broader badgeholder set to gather additional feedback and enable broader voting and calibration of these questions. The aim of the workshop & survey is to make the application process better aligned with the needs and expectations of badgeholders, ultimately leading to more accurate rewarding of impact in Retro Funding 5.Below are the final application questions which were selected as a result of the workstream:Ethereum Core Contributions: How does your project support, or is a dependency of, the OP Stack? How would it impact the OP Stack if your project ceased to exist?OP Stack Research & Development: How has your project advanced the development of the OP Stack? Who has benefited the most from your work on the OP Stack and how?OP Stack Tooling: How has the infrastructure you built enabled the testing, deployment, and operation of OP chains? Who has used your tooling and how has it benefited them (Please reference relevant data sources which surface the impact of your tooling, such as user surveys, testimonials, attestations etc)?Other Updates & ChangesProject grant and funding reporting: SeeRetro Funding 5: Grants & Funding within the application processpost for more details.Add Links:  Applicants can now add links to their projects. They can add any link which supports them in showcasing their impact. They may also provide a name and description for each link.Improved project creation to application handover: The final step in creating a project in our system is to publish that project‚Äôs metadata onchain. Some projects completed this step, but then failed to also submit an application. Messaging has been added to make it clear that after publishing a project, applicantsmust also submit an applicationto participate in a retro round.Round details and application:We‚Äôve made the round details (found in the round application) visible to anyone before signing in.Markdown support:In the round application, free form input fields will support markdown.","Retro Funding 5, hosted on OP Atlas by Agora (code available), runs August 22nd-October 10th (signup, review, voting, results).  This round introduces ""Organizations,"" grouping related projects for clearer application evaluation.  Projects are distinct contributions; individual tasks are excluded.  The application process includes refined questions focusing on verifiable impact, categorized by Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack R&D, and OP Stack Tooling, informed by badgeholder feedback.  Improvements also include link additions, clearer application submission instructions, and markdown support.

For a full overview of the application review process seeRetro Funding: Application Review Process.Reviewer ExpectationsAny Citizen who participates in the review process should meet the following expectationsTime Commitment:As a reviewer you should expect to commit a minimum of 10 hours to participating in the review process. There‚Äôs a need for you to have ongoing availability during the process running from October 14 - October 28.OP Governance:You should have high level familiarity with the OP Governance and its components to enforce the eligibility criteria. Please make sure you understand and are comfortable with enforcing theeligibility criteriabefore you sign up.Communication & Synch calls:Stay attentive to messages, announcements, and action steps provided by the Lead Reviewers. Attend the onboarding call and attend regular reviewer sync calls.Stick to the rules: Thoroughly review applications according to the application review checklist. You need to provide a written explanation for your review. Diverting from the rules to implement your personal values is unacceptable and will result in removal from the review process.Conflicts of Interest:You are required to declare projects you have a conflict of interest with when applying to be a reviewer. Badgeholders with a COI will not be able to participate in the round.Reviewer SelectionCitizens will be selected as Reviewers via a combination of an opt-in process and random sampling. This allows for a smaller group to engage in the process, while still being fairly selected via random sampling.Opt-in:Citizens can opt-in to participate in the application review process until Oct 11th 19:00 UTC. Only Citizens can participate who do not have a Conflict of Interest with a project applying to the round.To opt-in please fill outthis formand be sure you have read the Reviewer Expectations listed above.Random Sampling:22 reviewers will be randomly selected from the citizens who have opted-in to review. Selection will take place on October 11th and citizens will be notified via email about the outcome of the random selection.Lead Reviewers:Diego, the Citizens‚Äô House Gov NERD, will act as a non-voting lead reviewer, responsible for resolving questions, collecting votes, managing the timeline of the process and facilitating collaboration.Reviewer Groups:Instead of randomly assigning reviewers to cases, there will be 4 reviewer groups with 5 reviewers each. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to a group. This design aims at reducing the operational and technical complexity, as well as allow for more collaboration among reviewers.Application Review Process OverviewApplication is submittedviaretrofunding.optimism.ioApplication is assignedto reviewer group (see ‚ÄúReviewer Selection‚Äù)Appeal:If a majority of reviewers rejected the application, the applicant can hand in an appeal. The appeal will then be reviewed by 5 reviewers from a different reviewer group to the one that did the initial review. The reviewer group decides if the application is rejected/approved by majority vote.Application Edits:Edits to a project‚Äôs application are only allowed in cases where the application form itself is misguided or deceived applications, bugs caused input errors or the application category was selected wrong. The Foundation decides which applications are allowed to be edited. Relevant edits are made following the Full Review and are considered within the Appeals process.Application rulesBelow are rules for which violation will result in the removal of an application from a Retro Funding round.False statements & deception- false claims about your contributions, past impact or funding & grants are not allowed.Hateful Content- No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination as defined by therules of engagementDeceiving badgeholders- Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users.Fraud & Impersonation- Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project; the funds must go to the project.Advertising- Using Retro Funding application to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT dropOutside of Retro round scopeor not meeting eligibility criteria - Contributions that do not have a clear relationship to the scope of the retro round, or do not meet eligibility criteriaSpam- Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links. Applications in languages other than English .This will help simplify the process as English is the working language of the majority of Badgeholders. Please ensure you translate any content that‚Äôs part of the application.Duplicate applications- Multiple applications from the same individual, project or group which apply for the same impact.Members ofcontribution paths(Council Members, Ambassadors, NumbaNERDs, SupNERDs, TechNERDs, Translators) or Councils can‚Äôt submit individual applications for their work within the relevant workstream, as each workstream will apply as a project.Review ChecklistReviewers will be asked to go over this checklist when performing the initial review of an application. Please note that this is an early draft.Spam:Does the application contain spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links? Is the application in another language than English?Eligibility:Is this application Eligible, following the eligibility criteria of the round? [Referencecategory specific criteria checklist]Category:Is this application eligible for another category, different to the one they have selected?Optimism Grants:Has the application correctly reported the grants they have received from Optimism (including Token House, Citizens‚Äô House an Foundation grants)?Venture Funding:Has the application correctly reported their venture funding based on public information?Pricing:Has the application correctly reported their current pricing? See by checking the pricing on the projects website.Impersonation:Does the application have a verified Github repo which belongs to the organisation they claim to be? Do any linked artefacts not belong to the project?Future promises:Does this application make promises about work they will do in the future?Advertising:Does this application actively promote a token or NFT sale in their application or on their website?Conflicts of Interest ruleA large number of citizens will apply with their project to Retro Funding 6. To prevent possible bias within the review process, only citizens without a Conflict of Interest with a project in the round will be allowed to participate.",Summary not available

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Analysis of Voting Data for Retro Funding 5,https://gov.optimism.io/t/analysis-of-voting-data-for-retro-funding-5/9130,"For the last three RF rounds, my team at OSO has published a report that analyzes the voting data. We just published our report on RF5here. Here is our report onRF4andRF3.Key points:This was the flattest reward distribution yet.The top project (geth) received 235K OP. The median project received 93K. Even the lowest ranked project received 37K, which was more than 70% of projects received in Round 4. Basically, it was a good round for ‚Äúaverage‚Äù projects.The reward distribution was flat because ‚Ä¶ voters voted on flat distributions.There‚Äôs a lot of dataviz illustrating this point in the report. Have a look. There‚Äôs an important idealogical question about how voters feel about power law distributions, ie, is it a ‚Äúgood‚Äù outcome for a handful of projects to receive most of the retro funding.Experts voted differently than non-experts.In this round, there was anexpertise dimension(as well as expert guest voters from the developer community). There are meaningful differences in how these groups allocated rewards and differentiated among projects. This raises important questions about the composition of voters in a given roundThe report has lots of data visualizations and statistics.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Retro Funding 6: Announcing Guest Voter participation,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-6-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8816,"Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 6 was recently announced, and will award OP to contributions made to the Optimism Collective governance system. As part of Round 6, a set of Guest Voters will be invited to participate alongside Citizens. Similar to theexperiment in Round 5, the goal is to learn more about different voter selection mechanisms as a way to create a foundation of knowledge that can be used when making decisions about Citizen selection in the future.Research QuestionsThere are two primary research questions inspiring this experiment:Do selection methods that aim to select for specific characteristics (such as Web of Trust or Proof of Work) result in a significantly different group composition than random selection?Do randomly selected voters make resource allocation decisions that are significantly different from voters selected via Web of Trust / Proof of Work? Are we able to assess those differences to be better / worse?The first research question derives from a hypothesis that selection methods are better than random chance at selecting for specific characteristics. We currently have two cohorts of voters that were selected with a specific selection method: Citizens that were selected via Web of Trust and Round 5 Guest Voters that were selected via Proof of Work. Without a control group, we cannot make any assumptions about the effectiveness of these methods in selecting specific characteristics. Randomly selecting a set of Guest Voters enables us to create this control group and use this group as a baseline against which to compare the two previously selected groups as well as future groups.The second research question goes a level deeper to try and understand whether deliberately selected voters actually perform differently on the allocation task than a random group of people. Once again the current experiment can be thought of as the creation of a control group against which to compare Citizens. Having a control group is valuable as it allows us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô. In this case, the treatment is ‚Äòbeing selected via Web of Trust‚Äô. If the control group is found to vote in a similar way to Citizens, then there is no effect of ‚Äòbeing selected via Web of Trust‚Äô on the outcome, which is the Retro Funding allocation.Experiment Outcome MeasuresResearch Question 1Do selection methods that aim to select for specific characteristics (such as Web of Trust or Proof of Work) result in a significantly different group composition than random selection?The following outcomes will be measured to address the first research question:Social graph modularity of Guest VotersProfessional background / occupation of Guest VotersEngagement and alignment of Guest Voters with the Optimism CollectiveThese measures will be analyzed partially through data associated with Guest Voters‚Äô Farcaster Accounts and linked Ethereum accounts, and partially through data collected in an onboarding survey. The outcomes will be compared with similar measures made for Round 5 Guest Voters and Citizens.Research Question 2Do randomly selected voters make resource allocation decisions that are significantly different from voters selected via Web of Trust / Proof of Work? Are we able to assess those differences to be better / worse?The following outcomes will be measured to address the second research question:Voting behavior (time spent voting, number of metrics selected etc.)OP allocation patterns (allocation distribution curve, min and max allocation, median allocation, delta between allocation and ratings provided in impact attestations)The votes of Citizens and other stakeholders on which overall allocation was perceived to be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô that of the Guest Voters or Citizens.Experiment OperationsIn order to address the research questions above, a set of voters must be randomly selected. There are a few high-level requirements of this random selection mechanism:It mustn‚Äôt select the same person twice (i.e. one-person-one-vote)It must select from the general population of Superchain usersThere should be as little bias in the sample as possibleThe first step of random selection is defining the population. Once the population is defined, a random number generator can be used to randomly select a set of individuals.There are a few ways to think about defining the population. One is to make an announcement allowing anyone to register their interest, and then randomly select from the set that registered. However, this approach introduces a lot of bias into the sample because the population to be sampled from is skewed towards individuals that are highly engaged with Optimism.A preferable way to randomly select participants is to define the population as broadly as possible, randomly select individuals and reach out to them with an invitation to participate. There will still be some bias in the sample, but considerably less than if the opt-in process happens prior to the random selection.The goal is therefore to define a representative population of Superchain users, where there is a low probability that the same person is selected twice, and there is the ability to reach selected individuals with an invitation to participate. After reviewing several options, we decided to sample from the population of active Farcaster accounts. This is because:The Farcaster Protocol runs on OP Mainnet, so Farcaster users are users of the SuperchainIt is possible to reach any Farcaster user via cast or DMThe population is large enough - all Farcaster accounts is ~750,000 users, with ~50,000 being active dailyThe population is likely representative of the larger set of active Superchain users - creating a social account is a common action and the set is unlikely to be skewed towards any specific characteristicWhile some users have multiple Farcaster accounts, the rate of user:account is probably lower than the rate of user:Ethereum accountRandom sampling processStarting with all Farcaster accounts that were created‚Ä¶Filter out business accounts (we want people, not organizations)Filter out existing Citizens and Round 5 Guest VotersFilter out accounts that have had zero Farcaster activity in the last 3 monthsRun a script to randomly select votersReach out to voters with the invitation to participateRun the script again to select new voters to fill the remaining unfilled slots until the target number of Guest Voters has been reachedWhat about Sybils?While the probability that two accounts belonging to the same person are selected in a set of tens or hundreds of thousands of accounts is low, we must still consider Sybil-resistance in the experiment design.All Guest Voters are required to participate in an onboarding process that includes a video call requiring active participation. Voters that don‚Äôt participate will not receive a voting badge.Experiment DesignRetro Funding 6 will see the participation of a record number of Guest Voters. Approximately 100 Guest Voters will participate alongside roughly the same number of Citizens. The purpose of inviting such a large cohort of Guest Voters is to maintain experiment conditions that have a similar number of participants.While Guest Voters will participate in the allocation task under the same conditions as Citizens, at the end of the round their votes may be counted differently.Citizens will be able to review the aggregated voting results of Guest Voters and cast a final vote on whether to integrate the votes of Guests at a 1:1 ratio, or whether to diminish the aggregate voting power of the Guest cohort by 25%, 50% or 100%. This process will act as a fail-safe in case the system is captured by Guest Voters.",Summary not available

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Joan's RPGF5 Reflections,https://gov.optimism.io/t/joans-rpgf5-reflections/8924,"In line with what I did forRPGF3andRPGF4, I will use this thread to share my reflections concerning RPGF5.In this first post I will collect my take-aways from the process of participating as areviewerandappeals reviewerin RPGF5.And then I‚Äôll return later to share my reflections on thevoting processin a second post.PreconditionsRound scopeRPGF5is designed to reward contributors to the OP Stack. Impact must have been generated between October 2023 - August 2024, and the following 3 categories are recognized:Ethereum Core ContributionsOP Stack Research & DevelopmentOP Stack ToolingAs application turnout for the round was lower than expected, the round design was updated toallow voters to decide on the round sizingwith the stipulation that the token allocation should be no less than 2M OP, and no more than 8M OP.Basic voting designAlong with the total allocation, each voter is asked to vote on the distribution of funds between the three mentioned categories, and on the distribution of funds between the individual applicants within one of the categories.Each category will be assignedtwo groups of voters: A group of expert voters (guests and citizens) and a group of non-expert (citizens only) voters.Review ProcessMain overall impressionFrom a reviewer standpoint, the RPGF4 review left me with two main wishes: More clarity around what reviewers need or need not check, and better software tools available to reviewers.In RPGF5, we took a big step forward with regard to clarity on the review task. The software tools also improved somewhat - though I would have to say that I believe that there is still room for further improvement.Clarity, objectivity and consistencyWhereas I‚Äôm generally in favour of recognizing subjective evaluation as a perfectly valid part ofthe voting process, I seereviewersas administrative workers tasked with upholding a set of predefined rules and criteria on behalf of the community. In order to be able to do this reliably and consistently, the guidelines must be clear and actionable, and there should be little room or need for personal opinions in the process.In RPGF5 I was very happy to see the introduction of a reviewer‚Äôs checklist which attempted to turn the abstract application rules into concrete checks for the reviewers to perform, as well as a list of specific rejection reasons that corresponded 1:1 with the checklist items.Much discussion came out of this - arguably the round eligibility criteria were lacking some nuances, forcing reviewers to reject applications that they would have very much liked to include in the round. Looking at the bigger picture, though, I consider this review round a success:The review task was much clearer to me than in previous rounds, discussions among reviewers were much more focused around the defined criteria and their limits, and it seems to me that the outcome was a higher degree of concensus among reviewers on what projects must be rejected and why.Also, when you can‚Äôt just make exceptions based on personal whims, any problems with the defined rules become very clear. I‚Äôm sure that this will help shape the rules and checklists in future rounds.SoftwareI was invited to help check out Charmverse‚Äôs updates before the review was kicked off. Thanks,@Jonasand@ccarella!I enjoyed doing a bit of testing, some issues were definitely improved in this round, and I would be happy to take part in this bit of the process again in the future.It would be awesome if the test process could over time become a bit more organized with clearer follow-up on the issues found - at least, as a tester, what you always wish to know when you have done your bit is: What issues will the developer team try to tackle, and (when) is further testing needed?There is a great difference between ‚Äútrying the new software to confirm that it works‚Äù and ‚Äútesting with the objective of finding both obvious and less obvious issues and improvement potentials‚Äù. I could see this turning into a regular OP contribution path over time.Hours spentI didn‚Äôt time myself, but I believe I spent about 25 hours in total on the review process (not including the testing mentioned above, but including watching the kickoff recording, reviewing ~100 applications, doing some background research, discussing with other reviewers, handling appeals and taking notes for this post).A norm of 15 minutes per review had been discussed in the context of the Collective Feedback Commission previous to the review round, and I think this round supported this estimate.In contrast to previous rounds, I felt that my time was generally spent on productive and focused work in this round.Improvements and future requestsBelow, I will share a list of quick notes on what I see as the biggest achievements in this review round, and the most important things that I would love to see improve in future rounds.I‚Äôm happy to comment on any of these if needed - just ask.ImprovementsAs already mentioned, the reviewer checklist and rejection reasons that 1:1 represented the items on the reviewer checklist were a BIG step up!There were quite a large number of applications per reviewer, but assigning reviewers to 1-2 categories was helpful in easing the mental load.Having small predefined reviewer teams supported accountability (visibility and, I think, a nice sense of team spirit).It was great to have private Telegram channels for reviewer discussions! Good conversations, supportive atmosphere. Also, nice to be able to see channels for all categories for context and inspiration.The new ‚ÄòMy Work‚Äô tab in Charmverse was awesome!Future requestsI would like more clarity around how to handle projects that seem to (somewhat) fit several categories. If we include them everywhere, they are likely to be rewarded multiple times for the same impact; if we exclude them, they run the risk of not being accepted in a future round and end up without rewards.The application rules / eligibility criteria should say something about the eligibility of projects that have already been rewarded in previous RPGF rounds.It would be good for reviewers and voters alike to have API access to all application data. OP Atlas was mentioned once or twice in the review process, but I don‚Äôt know how to access the data there‚Ä¶ is there a way to do that?There were still some issues around data integrity (missing github and organizational information). Issues were being handled as they surfaced, but for this reason too it would be good to be able to access the original data somehow in cases of doubt.Often, important details are clarified in the review process. Reviewers and applicants both contribute with various comments and discussions. Appeals also tend to contain a lot of important context. It would be good, I think, to spend some time considering how this information can best be carried over into the voting round.It would be nice for all reviewers to have full read access to comments related to all applications under review. Right now, it seems like we only have access to the applications to which we are directly assigned. Having access to all would give better transparency and context.While the new ‚ÄòMy Work‚Äô tab was great, I missed being able to sort applications based on various criteria, especially Category.I sorely missed being able to open applications in a new tab/window in CharmverseThe UI should make sure that reviewers always leave a text comment to explain their thinking when they reject an application, along with the specific rejection reason from the predefined list.There were some difficulties related to the way applicants were asked to represent themselves in terms of organizational structure and projects. Reviewers need to be able to easily see which organization a project/application belongs to, and a list of all projects/applications belonging to a given organization.Even so, applicants should be adviced to make sure that all needed information is included in every application! There were cases where applicants referred to funding information given in another application - which not only makes the reviewer‚Äôs job more complex, but also poses an obvious problem for voters if only one of these applications actually makes it into the voting round.In Charmverse, it would be nice to be able to see the voting status for each application in the overview (one‚Äôs own vote AND the total number of votes for and against)In the list of rejection reasons, adding a ‚ÄúWrong category‚Äù option would probably help streamline the process.As a very small detail, the ‚Äòhidden‚Äô private ‚ÄúReviewer notes‚Äù in Charmverse (top right corner link in the individual application view) are not useful and should probably just be removed to avoid potential misunderstandings.Oh‚Ä¶ And the bug that causes all reviewer votes to be reset if the last reviewer decides to undo his votereallyshould be fixed.","This report summarizes the author's experience as a reviewer and appeals reviewer for the OP Stack Grants Round 5 (RPGF5).  Improvements included clearer review guidelines, a helpful checklist, and improved software (Charmverse).  However, challenges remain, such as handling applications fitting multiple categories, ensuring data integrity, and improving software functionality (e.g., sorting applications, multi-tab viewing).  The author suggests API access to application data,  better handling of cross-application references, and increased reviewer transparency.  Approximately 25 hours were spent reviewing ~100 applications, supporting a previously estimated 15-minute-per-application timeframe.  Overall, RPGF5 was deemed a success, yielding greater reviewer consensus than previous rounds.

Retro  Funding Missions üî¥,Voting UX for Retro Funding 5,https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-ux-for-retro-funding-5/8991,"In Retro Funding 5: OP Stack, the Optimism Foundation designed a new Voting UX for badgeholders (aka voters). Based on past learnings, our key objectives were to enablemore focus & better decision makingamong voters.In round 3, there were over 600 projects and each required review. Badgeholders reported spending 20-30 hours in that grueling review process. In round 5, we increased focus by dramatically reducing the number of projects under review (we achieved this by reducing each round‚Äôs overall scope).In addition to reducing the project count, we also decreased the cognitive load required to review projects, rank them, and allocate rewards.We introduced voting subcategories. In round 3, it was difficult to compare projects because they were often very different from one another. In round 5, badgeholders only review projects that are like one another.We introduced an impact scoring system. Voters first consider each project‚Äôs impact in isolation before allocating OP.We introduced allocation methods. These are opinionated algorithms that help voters allocate OP across their ranked ballot.Retro Funding voters set budgets, compare projects, consider their impact, and decide on rewards. It‚Äôs a big commitment, and it‚Äôs a lot of work. Our voting UX won‚Äôt solve for everything (much of the work will still happen outside the voting app in forums, on discord, on telegram, etc), but we aimed to provide a more consistent, helpful, and dynamic tool than voters had seen before‚Äîso they can submit a more confident vote.Note that in this breakdown, I use the terms badgeholder and voter interchangeably.welcome3552√ó2354 199 KBIn round 5, 79 OP Stack projects were approved across three categories: Ethereum Core Contributions, OP Stack Research & Development, and OP Stack Tooling. Each badgeholder reviews projects within only one of the categories (20-30 projects per badgeholder), a major reduction compared to past rounds.budget3552√ó2354 344 KBTo start the process, badgeholders vote on the overall budget. This is the first time they‚Äôve been asked to do this, and we understand it‚Äôs a big question. To assist their reasoning, we provide contextual information in the right hand column.Next, they decide how much of the budget should be given to each category. They can dig into category details and view the projects within them. The tool previews OP amounts as they edit their percentage inputs.score1920√ó1272 101 KBWhen ready, voters move onto the scoring step.In previous rounds, they went from reviewing projects directly to allocating OP. This meant that ranking projects, determining impact, and assigning OP was unguided and incredibly difficult. Feedback indicated that this led to overly simplified decision making.In round 5, badgeholders first score each project before ‚Äúunlocking‚Äù their ballot. Project pages cleanly and consistently display impact statements and other metadata, and we hide non-essential information for improved comprehension of key information.When scoring, a project‚Äôs impact is considered in isolation. We think this will result in a fair and thoughtful assessment of each project apart from the others. In regards to focus, voters once again benefit.

They can revisit a project to change its score, or they can simply drag and drop to adjust its position in the ballot.ballot3552√ó2828 268 KBNext, voters can explore allocation methods.Voters choose a preset and the method fills their ballot percentages from top-to-bottom. These methods are a starting point, meant to simplify the process of allocating OP.  To choose a method, voters just have to decide across a few variables. For impact groups, did projects that were scored the same deliver similar impact? For top-to-bottom, does my ranked list represent a fairly even separation of impact? For top weighted, are the projects at the top of my ranked list much more impactful than the ones at the bottom?We expect that most badgeholders will start with an allocation method, then customize their ballot from there. We hope the presets are useful, helping voters more quickly make judgements that feel fair to them.Tangentially, it‚Äôs important to note that at any point badgeholders can return to the budget step. Reviewing the impact of 20-30 projects could make them reconsider the round budget. We designed the system flexibly, so they could make budget edits at any time.voted1920√ó1272 52.6 KBWe expect this version of the voting app to result in more focus for badgeholders, and to aid in better decision making‚Äîultimately increasing confidence in the vote.Retro Funding is a massive initiative with many dimensions needing consideration and balance‚Äîand we appreciate any feedback that helps us improve.

Thanks for reading and stay optimistic!","Optimism Foundation's Retro Funding 5 improved its voting UX by significantly reducing the cognitive load on badgeholders.  Round 5 focused on fewer projects (79 across three categories, compared to over 600 in Round 3), categorized projects for easier comparison, and introduced an impact scoring system before OP allocation.  Badgeholders now set a budget, allocate funds across categories, score projects individually, and then utilize allocation methods (preset algorithms) to distribute OP based on rankings. This streamlined process, aided by GitHub metrics, aims to foster more focused and confident voting decisions, although further community discussion still occurs outside the app.

Citizens  üë•,Retro Funding 5 Guest Voter Selection Algorithm Explanation,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-guest-voter-selection-algorithm-explanation/8719,"In this experiment, we wanted to rank developers, identified by their GitHub accounts, based on their proximity to OP Stack repos. We trialed a unique approach with a custom implementation of the EigenTrust algorithm.Special thanks to Carl Cervone (Open Source Observer), Emily Furlong (Optimism Foundation) and Eugene Kim (OpenRank), Jenya Nepoimannykh (OpenRank).The Foundational Method: Capturing the Web of Trust via Recursive Trust GraphGiven a community of peers, their interactions with each other form a directed graph. Here, the peers become nodes within the graph and their interactions are the graph edges. These asymmetric edges can be viewed as trust arcs from one peer to the other. Additionally, the weight of each edge signals the degree of trust imparted by one peer onto another.The EigenTrust algorithm can then be run on such graphs to measure the impact of recursive trust propagation, leading to a global trust value for each peer or node in the network. Thus, every node gets assigned a reputation score. In a bipartite graph, there are two types of nodes, for example, GitHub repos as well as GitHub users as givers and receivers of trust forms a bipartite graph. EigenTrust not only works well with peer-to-peer data, but it can also be used for bipartite graphs, the implementation of which is achieved using the Hubs and Authorities algorithm. In a bipartite graph, there are two types of nodes, for example, GitHub repos as well as GitHub users as givers and receivers of trust forms a bipartite graph.The Goal of the Exercise and the Choice of AlgorithmGoalTo rank developers, identified by their GitHub accounts, based on their proximity to OP Stack repos.ApproachOpenRank enables verifiable compute for a large class of reputation algorithms, **in particular those that (a) operate on a graph, (b) are iterative in nature and (c) have a tendency toward convergence. In the following sections, we give a brief overview of some of these algorithms.For our Developer ranking use case, we obtained a graph of relevant GitHub event data from Open Source Observer, covering more than 2,000 organizations and over 30,000 code repositories. We established two kinds of peers: GitHub users and repositories. We then used a variation of EigenTrust, the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, which computes rankings on an asymmetric bipartite trust graph.Below are the two different trust edges used in the graph:User-to-repository trust- this signals the user‚Äôs interest in the repository through actions such as stars, forks and issue/PR submissions.Repository-to-user trust- this signals the credit extended by the repository to the user for their contribution. Actions such as PRs merged, direct code commits received, and other maintenance actions.The reason for using these two different and asymmetric trust arcs between users and GitHub repositories is to ensure accuracy and sybil resistance in the rankings. For trust-critical use cases, shared interest signal is often not necessarily a good measure of trust. For example, sybil actors can create thousands of trust arcs directed to a malicious or irrelevant repository. We solve this in two ways, choose a set of somewhat trustworthy/useful seed peers (GitHub repositories); and using a trust arc from a repository to a user based on a relevant credit signal such as merging a PR.Once the compute is run, the resulting global trust can be used for ranking both users and GitHub repositories.Compute Model Assumptions and WeightsTrust SignalsIn this model, we use developers (GitHub username) and OP Stack repositories as nodes in the trust graph. We establish trust arcs between users and repositories and vice versa in the following manner:User-to-repository actions (interest signals) include:Starring the repositoryForking the repositoryOpening an issueOpening a pull requestDirectly committing to the repositoryRepository-to-user actions (credit signals) include:Having a pull request merged into the repository (approximated by opening of a pull request as of this exercise)Directly committing to the repositoryRepository maintenance, such as merging a PR, resolving an issue, etc.Choice of Seed Peers and Alpha ValueSeed peers are core OP Stack repo, weighted by their relative importance.Core repos with higher importance (weight =2)‚Äòtestinprod-op-erigon‚Äô‚Äòa16z/magi‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/optimism‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/op-geth‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/asterisc‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/kona‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/design-docs‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/specs‚ÄôOther core repos with importance (weight=1)‚Äòethereum-optimism/superchain-ops‚Äô,‚Äòethereum-optimism/op-analytics‚ÄôAlpha (Œ±) ValueŒ± is a parameter in EigenTrust algorithm that determines the significance of seed peers influence that shapes the reputation score of every other peers in the entire network. Alpha value is normally chosen between 0 and 0.5 and the higher the alpha the stronger the influence of seed peers, meaning the trust arc from seed peers to other peers will matter more for a peer‚Äôs relative reputation.A weak alpha value ( Œ±=0.2 ) is chosen in this exercise, intending to discover more repos related to OP stack, and attribute contribution back to developers. Relatively less influential seed peers could let the other peers express more reputation credit to other repos and peers, therefore suits the purpose of the exercise. To read more about alpha value, check out the EigenTrust documentationhere.Reasoning of the Weights Choices for Trust ArcsThe weight ratio in the same class of actions (user-to-repo, or repo-to-user) matters.User-to-repo weights signals the seriousness of interest as well as the effort that would go into the action. Least to most significant: Forking < (committing directly, starring) < (opening issue, merging PR) < opening PR. A relative weight was assigned accordingly.Forking is a chore when someone wants to take a look at the repo and try something out quickly. (weight=1)Starring is a long-term interest signal to get updates from the repo and also skew the feed. (weight=5)Opening an issue actually takes nonnegligible effort. (weight=10)Opening a PR takes more effort as it also has proposed changes. PR opening reflects an original work. (weight =20)PR merging reflects a maintenance/review action. Typically it takes more effort for someone to create a patch and open a PR than to review it. (weight =10)Direct commits would normally sit between opening an issue and opening a PR; there are a lot of automated direct commits/pushes so we dial it down to the same level as opening an issue. (weight=5)Repo-to-user weight signals the degree of credit ‚Äúthank you‚Äù from the repo(‚Äôs maintainers) to contributors (users). It can be thought of credit/‚Äúthank you‚Äù from the repository to the contributors.  Least to most significant: merging PR (maintainer action) < direct commits (maintainer/allow-listed contributor action) < authoring and submitting a PR (which was eventually merged). A relative weight was assigned accordingly.Iteration on the Ranking ResultsThere were several rounds of iteration on the algorithm, but it should by no means be interpreted to be in its final state. The process of adjusting and improving an algorithm of this type is a continuing effort and we imagine that this algorithm still has room for improvement, but is of sufficient quality for use in this experiment.The first iteration of the algorithm appeared to overvalue outdated repos, so we added a time decay function. We also adjusted the weight of seed repos to reflect the relative importance to the OP stack. In running the algorithm we discovered that the choice between an alpha value of 0.5 and 0.2 did not have a significant effect on the ranking.Discussion: Future Optimizations and Sybil-resistanceThis is the first iteration of using OpenRank to compute reputation within OP Stack based on data inputs from Open Source Observer, eg: Github event data. A few topics can be explored further.Additional Signals for Increasing Model Performance and Sybil ResistanceUsing real (non-approximated) signal of having a pull request merged into the repositoryInstead of approximating ‚Äúopened PR = merged PR‚ÄùParsing GitHub events for more concrete signs of collaboration (eg, comments on issues, co-authored pull requests) and assessing the quality of those collaboration signals (eg, a conversation taking place over multiple weeks might be higher signal than one over a shorter interval)Both interest signals and credit signals are captured in the same local trust matrix.  The local trust may also capture user-user and repo-repo trust signals (the latter being, once again, the success attribution signals), so the graph is not necessarily bipartite. Some examples:Following/Starring other usersRepository dependencies (if repo A depends on repo B, A‚Äôs success should be attributed to B)Factoring Action‚Äôs Size into the Trust Arc WeightExample: PR importance (e.g. documentation fix < a whole new feature)Subjective factor (what kind of PR is it?  feature? bug fix? doc? does the project use labels for these?)Objective factor (change size?)Expanded Seed TrustUse a wider selection of OP-related repos so users‚Äô contribution to those repos will directly increase the user‚Äôs trust standing via the seed trustTry and include both actors and objects in the seed.  Actors-only or objects-only seed trust often yields to slow convergence.Associate different weights to seed repos, e.g. according to their importanceAbout OpenRankOpenRankis a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any developer.The Verifiability of OpenRank powered Reputation ScoresAs a reputation protocol, the permissionless verifiability of the scores is a key property of OpenRank‚Äôs proposition. The verification methods that we propose are far cheaper than verification of general purpose computations, based on the intuition that iterative convergent algorithms on a graph are expensive to compute, but inexpensive to check (typically requiring one matrix-vector multiplication to check for convergence). This makes it far more practical to use this reputation computer for these use cases than a general purpose decentralized compute network.Contactgloria@karma3labs.comto access the full preliminary litepaper.To run the code yourself, start by creating a Google Cloud account and subscribe to the dataset following the below guides:docs.opensource.observerGet Started | Open Source ObserverThere are two easy ways of accessing OSO datasets: through our GraphQL APIdocs.opensource.observerData Overview | Open Source ObserverFirst, you need to set up your BigQuery account.

Citizens  üë•,Badgeholder Onchain Analysis,https://gov.optimism.io/t/badgeholder-onchain-analysis/8940,"This research analysis was conducted with the Optimism Foundation as part of theFoundation Grant.TL;DRThis analysis examines the on-chain behaviors of Badgeholders within the Superchain ecosystem, which includes OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, and Mode. It contrasts these findings with those of Non-Badgeholders across both Superchain and Non-Superchain chains, such as Ethereum and Arbitrum. The study shows that Badgeholders, despite having significant account age, exhibit lower overall activity levels compared to Non-Badgeholders. Notably, Badgeholders demonstrate a strong preference for Ethereum transactions and tend to focus their activities on a limited number of decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms. Additionally, more than half of the Badgeholders maintain connections with Farcaster, indicating a high level of social engagement. These insights will assist the Optimism Collective in developing effective strategies to increase Badgeholder participation and integration within the broader Superchain ecosystem.IntroductionThe primary goal of this mission is to establish a comprehensive baseline understanding of the current Badgeholder demographic within the Superchain ecosystem. By examining the on-chain activities of Badgeholders in comparison to Non-Badgeholders, this study aims to identify key behavioral patterns and differences. The analysis focuses on four main dimensions: activity duration, cross-chain engagement, application usage, and the prevalence of Farcaster connections. The insights gained from this analysis will support the Optimism Collective in its objective of expanding the Citizenry, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions about community engagement strategies and resource allocation to promote growth and sustainability.MethodsData for this analysis was carefully collected from two primary sources:EAS Attestation for Badgeholders(EAS Attestations): Thisdatasetincludes 132 RPGF Badgeholder addresses, and among these, a separatedatasetconsists of 102 addresses that have ENS labels linked to them. This information is essential for examining activities specific to Badgeholders, such as transaction behavior and engagement patterns across various applications.Dune Dashboard: This analytical platform was utilized to gather extensive transaction data and additional insights regarding Non-Badgeholders. The focus included a range of activity categories, including token transfers, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), NFT trades, and perpetual trading, providing a comprehensive view of user engagement within the Superchain ecosystem.To ensure a balanced comparison, Non-Badgeholders were categorized into two distinct groups based on specific criteria:Group 1 (132 addresses):This groupconsists of a comparative sample that matches the number of Badgeholders. All members meet rigorous criteria, including a minimum of 300 transactions on the Optimism network and at least 8 transactions within any single month, ensuring that the comparison is made with an equivalent level of activity.Group 2 (1,320 addresses):This larger datasetis used for additional comparative analysis, adhering to similar transactional criteria to provide insights into broader sample size and a deeper understanding of user behavior.For detailed data collection methods, please refer to the (Research Work):-Behind the scenesdocumentation.Results:Activity DurationBadgeholders have an average account age of 461 days, while Non-Badgeholders in Group 1 average 467 days and those in Group 2 average 469 days. This indicates that Badgeholders are relatively newer but have engagement levels similar to those of Non-Badgeholders.In tracking monthly activity, Badgeholders peaked at 84 active users in April 2024, compared to 122 in Group 1 and 115 in Group 2. Activity levels increased notably from April 2022, followed by stabilization through late 2022.Image1055√ó435 23.7 KBSource -Average Account Age of Badgeholders and Non-BadgeholdersImage1910√ó836 51.3 KBSource:Monthly Active Badgeholders & Non-BadgeholdersImage1910√ó834 92.9 KBSource Link:-Account age and transaction count of badgeholders & non-badgeholdersThe analysis of account age versus transaction activity revealed no significant correlation; both newer and older accounts exhibited diverse transaction volumes.In terms of user engagement, 94.69% of Badgeholders and 100% of Non-Badgeholders remained active for over two years. As of June 27, 2024, there are 87 active Badgeholders compared to 121 in Group 1 and 1,186 in Group 2, highlighting varying engagement levels within the ecosystem.Cross-Chain Activity OverviewBadgeholders average 410 transactions on Superchain chains and 597 transactions on Non-Superchain networks, while Non-Badgeholders in Group 1 average 997 transactions on Superchain, and Group 2 significantly leads with 8,368 transactions. This indicates that larger Non-Badgeholder groups are more active within Superchain.Image1061√ó447 39.1 KBSource Link:-Transaction Counts on Different chainsInterestingly, Non-Badgeholders consistently outperform Badgeholders on Superchain networks, particularly on OP Mainnet, while Badgeholders exhibit the highest activity on Ethereum, where 52.4% of their transactions occur.Overall, Badgeholders tend to favor Non-Superchain networks, but Non-Badgeholders, especially from larger groups, demonstrate higher transaction volumes on Superchain, indicating effective user engagement.Image1910√ó836 89.8 KBSource link:-Monthly transaction count of Badgeholders & Non-BadgeholdersTransaction activity trends reveal significant growth for Non-Badgeholders, particularly in the larger group, reflecting increasing engagement, while Badgeholders also show upward trends, highlighting evolving dynamics of user participation in the blockchain landscape.Activity Levels:The transaction activity analysis on Superchain networks indicates that Badgeholders have an average transaction count of 413.42 in the top percentiles, reflecting solid engagement. In contrast, specific Non-Badgeholder groups show even higher activity, with Group 1 averaging 1,001.86 transactions and Group 2 averaging 8,394.85 transactions. This highlights that while Badgeholders are engaged, certain Non-Badgeholder segments are exceptionally active, revealing varying levels of participation within the Superchain ecosystem.Application Usage:The analysis of transaction patterns across Superchain chains reveals distinct engagement levels between Badgeholders and Non-Badgeholders. Badgeholders demonstrate a strong preference for token-transfer activities, accounting for 86% of their transactions, followed by 9.3% in DEX transactions, with minimal activity in NFTs, social interactions, and DAO governance. In contrast, Non-Badgeholders in Group 1 also show a preference for token transfers at 85%, but they are more active in DEX transactions (12.3%). Non-Badgeholders in Group 2 emphasize token transfers even more (95.8%) while showing limited engagement in other categories, particularly NFTs and DAO governance. Overall, token-transfer activities dominate all user segments, highlighting a significant preference for decentralized exchange transactions across the Superchain ecosystem.Image1053√ó437 24.4 KBSource Link:-Top 10 DEX Applications used by badgeholdersImage1910√ó836 142 KBSource Link:-Monthly Transaction count of Badgeholders on different DEX applicationsOur analysis of Farcaster data for Badgeholders reveals intriguing user behavior patterns. Among the 132 Badgeholders, only three have custody addresses that directly match their Badgeholder addresses on Farcaster, indicating minimal direct matches. However, 70 Badgeholders (53%) appear on the verified list, suggesting that many users initially join Farcaster with alternative addresses and later add their Badgeholder addresses as verified. This behavior may reflect a strategic approach to managing digital identities or maintaining privacy.Farcaster VerificationA significant portion of Badgeholders, approximately 70 individuals, have successfully linked their Ethereum addresses to a Farcaster account. This high verification rate indicates a notable level of engagement and trust between Badgeholders and the Farcaster platform. Furthermore, transactions involving verified Badgeholders account for 61% of total transactions, compared to 39% from non-verified Badgeholders. This difference suggests that Farcaster verification is associated with higher engagement levels within the Superchain ecosystem.When examining the correlation between the number of Ethereum addresses linked to a Farcaster account and transaction volume, we find that Badgeholders with 3 to 4 connected addresses typically conduct over 1,000 transactions. Interestingly, some Badgeholders with a single connected address have reached up to 1,825 transactions, indicating that factors beyond network size, such as individual engagement levels and specific use cases, influence transaction activity.Image1055√ó442 30.2 KBSource Link:-Activity count of badgeholders with Farcaster verificationSmart Contract DeploymentOur research into smart contract deployment among Badgeholders reveals a significant difference. Only 0.8% of Badgeholders have deployed smart contracts on Superchain chains, with the overwhelming majority (99.2%) not participating in this advanced blockchain activity. Notably, no Badgeholders on the Optimism chain have deployed smart contracts, highlighting a significant gap in the utilization of these capabilities within the community.Temporal DifferencesWhen comparing the activity levels of Badgeholders from earlier rounds (RPGF Round 2) to those from later rounds (RPGF Round 3), we observe notable differences in transaction activity across various Superchain chains. Additionally, category engagement analysis shows that current Badgeholders are more active in the NFT sector on platforms like OpenSea, which has seen a substantial increase in engagement from 1 to 12.9 normalized counts. Conversely, engagement on Quix has decreased from 3.9 to 0.7. In the DEX category, there is a clear shift toward projects like Velodrome and Balancer, with Velodrome experiencing a significant rise in engagement from 4.7 to 24.2 normalized counts.Image1910√ó768 34.3 KBSource Link:-NFT Transaction countConclusionThis analysis of Badgeholders within the Superchain ecosystem reveals several important behavioral patterns. While Badgeholders have similar levels of experience to Non-Badgeholders, they tend to focus more on Ethereum for their transactions and prefer specific applications like Uniswap, Velodrome, and OpenSea. Although they engage more in token-transfer activities, their participation in areas such as DEX trading and smart contract deployment remains limited compared to Non-Badgeholders. The high level of Farcaster integration indicates strong social engagement within this group, yet there are opportunities for increased technical participation. These insights provide valuable guidance for the Optimism Collective in enhancing Badgeholder involvement and growing the Citizenry within the Superchain ecosystem.ResourcesReport Link:ReportDune Dashboard Link:Dune DashboardEAS Attestation Link:EAS AttestationsResearch Work:Behind the scenes","This research, funded by the Optimism Foundation, analyzes the on-chain behavior of Superchain (OP, Base, Zora, Mode) Badgeholders versus Non-Badgeholders (including Ethereum and Arbitrum).

Citizens  üë•,Badgeholder Onchain Analysis Report,https://gov.optimism.io/t/badgeholder-onchain-analysis-report/8881,"Optimism Badgeholder On-Chain AnalysisSummaryOptimism Badgeholders play an essential role in fueling the next generation of talent by rewarding current impactful work within the Optimism Collective and incentivizing the continuation of such work. For this reason, it is important to understandhow Badgeholders compare to typical active OP users. This knowledge will help governance make informed decisions in the design and expansion of the Citizen‚Äôs House while providing transparency to the public about the voters in the OP Collective. When looking at Badgeholders from the first three rounds of Retro Funding voting, we found that a higher percentage of OP Badgeholders are active in other DAOs, are involved in the creation of NFTs and Smart Contracts and have verified Farcaster accounts in comparison to a control group of active users.This study was done in conjunction with the Optimism Foundation as part of aFoundation Grant. All source data and charts can be referenced atthis dune dashboard.IntroductionOptimism Badgeholders have been an essential part of the Collective since the inception of the Citizen‚Äôs House, playing a key role in voting on important governance decisions such as the design and distribution of Retro Funding. Through these votes, they have been responsible for distributing over 50 million OP tokens during Retro Funding (RF) rounds. This makes their participation crucial in rewarding impactful work and encouraging continued contributions within the OP Collective. To better understand the influence of Badgeholders and ensure governance decisions are made transparently and equitably, it is important to compare them to typical active OP users. Here we explore OP Badgeholder‚Äôs transaction activity, governance participation, social app usage and smart contract deployment to better understand the characteristics of OP Badgeholders.MethodsOur work includes the 132 Badgeholder addresses that acted as voters for Round 3. It is important to note that Badgeholders may hold other addresses and may not exclusively conduct their blockchain activity using the address linked to their Badgeholder status. Indeed, four Badgeholders had only one transaction associated with their address, and 17 had fewer than 10 transactions. However, a substantial portion‚Äî31 Badgeholders‚Äîwere highly active, with more than 1,000 transactions linked to their address.We built a representative control group by selecting all non-Badgeholders addresses that conducted at least five transactions on Optimism in the last three months. This threshold was chosen to capture active users while avoiding including inactive or irregular participants. This resulted in a control group of approximately 1,160,000 addresses. We decided to use relatively broad qualifications for the control group to see best how Badgeholders compared to typical active Optimism users. For finer-scale comparisons and statistical tests, we used a random subset of 1,000 users from the control group. This subset was randomly selected from the larger control group. In cases where this smaller control group was used, it will be referred to as the subset control group.ResultsAs of August 15th, 2024 OP Badgeholders had completed 150,343 transactions, with 57,909 (39%)on OP Stack Chains vs 92,434 (61%) on non-stack chains. Badgeholders had a median of 315 total transactions, with a median of 56 on-chain transactions and 237.5 non-OP stack chain transactions.Transaction ActivityThe largest percentage of Badgeholder transactions occurred on Ethereum (43%), followed by Optimism (27%). In contrast, the control group had its highest transaction percentage on Optimism (23%), with Polygon coming in second (20%). Notably, in the last month (August 2024), the most frequent chain for Badgeholder transactions was to Base (33%), with Optimism following closely at 26%.

However, in August 2024, both groups showed a higher level of OP Stack chain engagement, with 60% of Badgeholder transactions and 62% of the control group‚Äôs transactions occurring on OP stack chains. This suggests that both groups may be increasingly prioritizing OP Stack chains.image1322√ó688 37 KBDAO ParticipationBadgeholders exhibit significantly higher involvement in governance across multiple chains. Badgeholders were more active in ENS (7%) and Uniswap (3%) DAOs compared to the control group, which had less than 1% participation in both DAOs. Overall similar percentages of Badgeholders and members of the control group are active in Arbitrum DAO. However, among the top 300 members of the Arbitrum DAO, 2% of Badgeholders held prominent positions (p < 0.0001), a percentage far exceeding that of the control group. All of these patterns suggests that Badgeholders are highly influential in cross-ecosystem governance.image974√ó792 36.6 KBimage974√ó792 35.4 KBSocial App UsageOver half of Badgeholders (59%) hold verified Farcaster accounts, a large contrast to just 12% in the control group.

Additionally, Badgeholders demonstrated a higher rate of smart contract creation on Optimism with 9 Badgeholders creating a total of 22 smart contracts. This indicates that Badgeholders are not only active in governance but also contribute more to the technical development of the ecosystem.image2496√ó792 55.8 KBConclusionsIn conclusion, Badgeholders in the Optimism Collective demonstrate a unique pattern of activity compared to typical active OP users. They are more engaged in governance across multiple DAOs, significantly more active on social platforms like Farcaster, and more involved in NFT creation and smart contract deployment. Though their transaction behavior on different chains varies slightly from that of the control group, both groups show similar percentages of transactions on OP Stack Chains. We hope that this dashboard and these findings will help inform the design of future Retrofunding rounds, and that the comparison to typical active wallets will help provide more context in the decisions around guest voting that will happen in Retrofunding Round 6.The full dune dashboard can be foundhere.","This on-chain analysis compares Optimism Badgeholders (key governance participants) to typical active users.  Badgeholders, responsible for distributing over 50 million OP tokens, show significantly higher engagement in cross-chain DAOs,  Farcaster usage (59% vs. 12%), NFT ownership (53% vs. 38%), and smart contract creation. While transaction activity on various chains differs slightly, both groups show increasing OP Stack chain engagement.  This research, conducted with the Optimism Foundation, aims to inform future governance decisions and increase transparency within the Optimism Collective.

Citizens  üë•,Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' House,https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439,"Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens‚Äô HouseWhat is random sampling?Random sampling is a widely used statistical method in which all members of a population (all Citizens) have the same probability of being selected. Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection.This method is widely used in a variety of disciplines when little is known about the entire population and/or extracting information from the entire population would be costly or infeasible. This is a powerful tool when considering the expansion of Citizenship and the increase in the number of rounds per year.Does random sampling presuppose Citizens are interchangable? -joanbpIt doesn‚Äôt! In fact, it makes no assumptions about Citizens at all, which is why one of the major advantages of random sampling is the reduction of bias that can occur via subsets selected in any other way. Opt-in methods are particularly susceptible to various biases and can create opportunities for capture by a small, active, and likely unrepresentative subset. Random samplingonlyassumes that each participant had an equal probability of selection.Why use random sampling now?Some of the most commonfeedbackin Round 3 was the need to more effectively scale the Retro Funding process (it was too time consuming for badgeholders!) and to provide more predictability for builders. There are a variety of measures we are introducing to address this feedback, including more frequent and narrowly scoped rounds. When scaling to four rounds per year (a 4x increase), we felt it was important to keep the expectation on badgeholder time relatively fixed (or even to reduce it.) Allowing badgeholders to opt-in to rounds limits the number of voices that are heard and may skew or bias the results towards a small subset of Citizens that are able to dedicate the most time. Full participation in all rounds, on the other hand, demands too much time and effort of the whole group. By requiring full badgeholder participation in two rounds and splitting participation between the other two rounds using random sampling, we believe we can achieve this goal. Throughout Season 6, we plan to experiment with random sampling as an alternate or additional method to reduce the workload required of any one badgeholder. More on why we believe this is a worthwhile experiment below.Why random sampling, specifically in the Citizens‚Äô House?Should only the most highly engaged Citizens be selected to participate? -gonnaThe Token House scales via political representation, which while increasing participation and (potentially) context, also concentrates power. Delegation increases participation but concentrates power among large delegates.  In this context, elected Councils, which delegate decision making power over specific decisions to a one member/one vote Council, can actuallyreducethe concentration of power in the Token House. A weakness of this model, which we will have to actively combat, is that it‚Äôs easy for the ~50 most highly engaged delegates to become responsible for making most decisions.In contrast, the Citizens‚Äô House operates via a one Citizen, one vote model which distributes powerevenlyamong the Citizenry, appearing much closer to a democracy. Elections, delegation, and/or otherpolitical scaling methodswill concentrate power in the Citizens‚Äô House. The downsides of these approaches in traditional democracies are thoroughly outlined inOpen Democracy. One ofH√©l√®ne Landemore‚Äôsmain hypotheses is that random sampling (sortition) can be used to avoid these downsides without a meaningful impact on collective outputs (paraphrased.)Reducing the concentration of power is one of the maingoalsof the Citizens‚Äô House and random sampling is a well tested method that could allow the Citizens‚Äô House to avoid a common failure mode of other governance systems: capture by a small subset or minority interest. Accordingly, we believe it is worth experimenting with random sampling to enable the Citizens‚Äô House to scaleby using statistical, rather than political, methods.With power evenly distributed among Citizens, the Citizens‚Äô House may serve as a more effective check on the Token House.In short, the intention is not that sampling be representative of a smaller subset of a certain type of Citizens, but rather to approximate a response from the entire Citizenry. High context, highly engaged Citizens should absolutely be recognized, rewarded, and respected within the Collective. Random sampling is not at odds with any of those objectives though!","Random sampling, where all citizens have an equal chance of selection, will be experimented with in the Citizens' House to improve the Retro Funding process.  This addresses feedback regarding time constraints and aims for more predictable outcomes as rounds increase. Unlike opt-in methods prone to bias, random sampling ensures broader participation while managing workload.  It avoids concentrating power, a potential weakness of other scaling methods, aligning with the Citizens' House's goal of distributed power and acting as a check on the Token House.  The aim is not to select a specific citizen type, but to approximate the entire citizenry's response.

Citizens  üë•,Cross Posting - Experimentation with Citizenship,https://gov.optimism.io/t/cross-posting-experimentation-with-citizenship/8732,"This is an article in thegovernance docs, cross-posted here for better visibilityThe Citizens‚Äô House is half of the Optimism Collective‚Äôs bicameral governance system, designed to work alongside the pure token-voting based Token House.The purpose of the Citizens‚Äô House is to:Reduce the concentration of power in the CollectiveSafeguard against the capture of the Token HouseAllocate resources according to the long-term benefit to the CollectiveAny changes to the Citizens‚Äô House, including changes to Citizen selection, should be evaluated based on their contribution to these objectives.Taking an experimental approach to Citizen selectionAn experimental approach to Citizen selection ensures that changes are made based on evidence rather than gut feeling. Guesswork and informed opinions play a part in the formation of hypotheses, but diverging opinions are settled through hypothesis-testing. This process ensures that as Citizen selection evolves over time, it is always evolving in the direction of progress towards the objectives. Changes that have an undesirable effect are rolled back, and mistakes are learned from to inform future improvements.Disclaimer:The types of experiments run in the name of Citizen selection are unlikely to be double-blind controlled trials. We seek to use the principles and practices of experimentation to the maximum extent feasible, with the aim of growing the amount of high-confidence knowledge about Citizen selection that the Collective has access to.Experimentation on Citizen selection in practiceEffective experimentation with Citizen selection has several prerequisites:The ability to measure both input and outcome variablesShort feedback cyclesReversibilityMeasuring both input and outcome variablesTo run effective experiments, the inputs and outcomes of those experiments must be measurable. Inputs (independent variables) are the aspects of Citizen selection that we want to change or influence, and outcomes (dependent variables) are the measurable effects of the experiment, usually tied to the overall objective we want to achieve. A large effort is underway to improve our ability to measure key aspects of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding), Citizens‚Äô House performance and other aspects of the Citizenry.Short feedback cyclesEffective experimentation often involves testing many different variables in different conditions. In order to make efficient progress, we need to be able to run a lot of experiments and learn from them quickly. Increasing the number of Retro Funding iterations per year and introducing new opportunities for experiments can allow us to shorten feedback cycles.ReversibilityThe primary objective of experimentation is to learn. Experiments are a risk - we are never sure what the outcome will be, otherwise there would be no need for an experiment. Any changes made to Citizen selection in the name of experimentation must therefore be reversible. The concept of guest voters in Retro Funding experiments is one way to ensure reversibility of experiments.Citizen selection experimentsThe purpose of experimentation with Citizen selection is to increase the Collective‚Äôs knowledge about the effectiveness of various different selection mechanisms to ultimately enable effective future decisions. Experiments are currently run as part of the planned Retro Funding iterations that happen multiple times per year, with experiment outcomes being shared publicly at the end of each experiment.For each Retro Funding iteration, a different selection mechanism may be tested by selecting a limited number of guest voters to participate in the round. Guest voters are temporary participants in Retro Funding votes, and should not be confused with Citizens who participate in protocol upgrade proposal vetoes in addition to Retro Funding votes. The purpose of introducing guest voters is to increase the reversibility of experiments.Increased data collection around Retro Funding votes and their participants is also an essential component of measuring experiment outcomes, and may take several forms:Surveys distributed to voters, builders and other stakeholdersAn analysis of voting behavior within and across Retro Funding votesMeasuring the concentration of power through social graph analysisAnother essential type of data required for experimentation with Citizen selection is identity and ‚Äòreputation‚Äô data. This forms an important input into selection mechanisms themselves and is therefore essential to the Collective‚Äôs ability to experiment with various approaches.Identity, reputation and Citizen selectionThere are a myriad of variations of the above approaches to Citizen selection that may be tested experimentally. Many such selection mechanisms rely on information about prospective Citizens to make selection decisions. Building a rich identity layer within the Collective allows these kinds of selection mechanisms to function.By enabling individual members of the Collective to build and maintain their identity as a Collective participant, potentially relevant information about the individual can be factored into the selection process. For example, some selection mechanisms may use someone‚Äôs professional contributions to the Collective as a deciding factor in whether they should be Citizens. Another might use the duration and depth of engagement with apps built on the Superchain. These are just hypothetical examples, but they illustrate the importance of individual identity in being able to test all selection mechanisms.Building outthe identity stack(opens in a new tab)ensures that the Optimism Collective is able to effectively experiment with all possible selection mechanisms to identify those with the best performance. It is therefore a core building block in the development of Citizenship. Without adequate data on potential candidate Citizens and the performance of the Citizenry on its objectives, it is impossible to experiment with selection criteria.To recapA solid and shared foundation of knowledge and data from open-sourced experiments is essential for the Collective‚Äôs decision-making ability.Experimentation with selection criteria is the most effective way to increase knowledge around the effectiveness of various approaches to Citizen selection.Measurement of inputs and outcomes of Citizen selection, short feedback loops and reversible changes are essential prerequisites for the Collective to build up a reliable process for experimentation.The Optimism Foundation currently runs experiments on Citizen selection using guest voters in Retro Funding iterations with the help of surveys, voting analysis and other methods to measure experiment outcomes.","The Optimism Collective's Citizens' House, a counterbalance to its Token House, aims to decentralize power and ensure long-term benefit.  Citizen selection employs an experimental approach, prioritizing evidence-based decisions over intuition.  This involves measuring input and output variables, utilizing short feedback cycles, and ensuring reversibility.  Experiments, currently conducted via guest voters in Retro Funding iterations, leverage data from surveys, voting analysis, and social graph analysis to improve Citizen selection mechanisms.  Building a robust identity layer is crucial for testing diverse selection criteria, ultimately enhancing the Collective's decision-making process.

This non-standardized approach sparkedvarious debateswithin the community about whether external funding (e.g., VC funding, Optimism grants, or external grants) should be deducted from a project‚Äôs overall public goods funding reward.Round 4 DefinitionInRetro Funding 4: Onchain Builders, a definition of profit will be universally applied to the retro round.

One of ourgoalsfor Retro Funding in 2024, is to test a few clear hypotheses in each round, the results of which will inform the design of future rounds and/or other parts of the governance system.image1190√ó1000 51.2 KBWhile the Foundation facilitates this iterative process, with the help of theCollective Feedback Commission, any member of the community may contribute to this process. Inspired by a community member‚Äôspost, we will test the below hypothesis, among others, during Retro Funding 4:A deliberative process can allow voters to come to consensus on a subject that would otherwise be difficult to come to consensus on.More specifically, we want to understand whether voter participation in a deliberative process increases agreement on a contested topic, and whether the resulting decision leads to broader satisfaction and clarity in the Retro Funding process.We will run this initial experiment as a pilot that could later be scaled to a larger sample size, applied to other parts of the Optimism governance system, and/or expanded to include an in-person assembly, if the preliminary findings are promising.  Specifically, we think a deliberative process could be useful in the setting of collective definitions and/or shared values, preventing gridlock between Houses, coming to collective consensus on complex topics, and/or the future creation of critical governance documents, similar to theLaw of Chains.What are Deliberative Processes?In its modern meaning, deliberation refers to a collective decision making process which aims to reduce the impact of power structures in discussion. In practice, it generally involves a set of three principles:Informed, structured, and facilitated discussion of pros and cons about a topic.A process that progresses from individual opinions towards collective judgement.A recruitment of a representative group to have the discussion. This is mostly achieved through ‚Äúsortition‚Äù (random selection of participants).Deliberative democracy has roots all the way back to Aristotle but deliberative processes have been flourishing over the past 20 years in local and global discussions (seeherefor many use cases). This method is currently utilized by the likes of the European Commission (to shape the directive on Food Waste, or the strategy on Virtual Worlds:https://citizens.ec.europa.eu/european-citizens-panels_en), national governments (more than 20+ such discussions have been held on Climate policy), or local governments (1000+ participatory budgeting discussions allowing citizens to allocate public funds to projects from the community).Tech platforms such asMetaandOpenAIhave explored deliberative processes among their users to discuss topics related to governing AI. In web3, Cosmos hasexperimentedwith deliberative processes to determine the process and principles for adding or removing chains to the Atom Economic Zone (AEZ).What are Deliberative Processes Useful For?More Informed Decision-Making: A deliberative process can aid a diverse group of voters with different perspectives and expertise in navigating complex topics without relying on popular opinions, resorting to groupthink, being pressured into conformity, or being driven towards partisanship.Greater Chance for Social Cohesion:Deliberative processes can incorporate varied viewpoints in the process of coming to a shared consensus and promote greater social cohesion between people from different backgrounds. We‚Äôve seen the opposite play out when the community has attempted to come to consensus in the absence of a structured deliberative process.Credibly Neutral Consensus:Structured deliberation gives participants an equal opportunity to discuss and debate the merits and drawbacks of multiple options among a representative sample rather than letting the loudest voices prevail in an unstructured social media debate. This process, facilitated by an expert external third party, can also reduce the influence of special interests (and the Foundation) in the formation of policy.Buy-In:Deliberative processes can increase the legitimacy of decision making via participation in the policymaking process. Voters may be more likely to commit to and/or abide by policies that have been proposed and agreed-upon amongst themselves.Retro Funding 4 DeliberationA subset of 50 Round 4 voters will be randomly selected to participate in the deliberative experiment. Randomly sampling individuals to make governance decisions (also called sortition) is common practice in deliberative democracy as higher quality discussion can be had with a smaller, but still representative, sample of the population. We will also experiment with sortition in Round 6.This subset of voters will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro Funding Round 4, facilitated by a team specialized in designing and running such processes (fromMissions PubliquesandRnDAO). This subset will be provided with balanced information on the topic to be debated in advance of the deliberations. Participants will work in a combination of plenary and subgroup settings across 2 sessions:Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft output of the deliberation. Also, the plenary moments of the sessions will be opened to the full set of voters in Round 4. This allows for the broader community to better understand and trust the decision-making process. The full Citizens‚Äô House will ratify the output of the deliberative process before Round 4 voting begins.The ratified outcome will be incorporated directly into the Retro Funding 4 voting mechanism.Next StepsIn 2024, you can expect to see a more scientific and interdisciplinary approach to research and experimentation in the Collective (thanks to our new Research and Experiments Lead,@elizaoak.) We‚Äôre excited to begin by testing a hypothesis that originated from a community member on the forums, and to experiment with an approach that empowers voters to address contested topics without interference from the Foundation.The Foundation will share additional details on the specifics of the deliberation on the forum before reaching out to the 50 randomly selected Round 4 voters via email.","Optimism's Retro Funding 4 will pilot a deliberative process to test if structured discussion improves consensus on contentious issues.  Fifty randomly selected voters will participate in two facilitated sessions, informed by balanced information and incorporating community feedback.

The results will inform future governance design, potentially scaling to larger groups and other Optimism systems, promoting more informed, cohesive, and neutral consensus building.

These Additional Signers will be tasked with double checking the transactions submitted by the Milestones and Metrics reviewers, and we expect ~3000 OP allocated to each Additional Signer in line with S6 Anticapture Commission‚Äôs signers rewards.7 total: 3 M&M Reviewers, 1 M&M Lead, 2 GC Reviewers, 1 DAB MemberBudget will include covering all hardware and software related to signing, as well as operations related expenses that arise for the M&M council. Examples may include funding a Dune dashboard creation to track grants impact, etc.Retroactive Funding Reserve Bonus: 20,000 OP total (new to S7)The Milestones and Metrics Council will not participate in Retro Funding for this SeasonSimilarly to the Grants Council 20,000 OP Reserve designated for algorithmic retroactive compensation. The algorithm will be designed and approved by the elected Milestones and Metrics Council members later in the season, ensuring fair and transparent distribution based on measurable contributions.Total Breakdown:Milestones and Metrics Reviewers (3): 75,000 OPMilestones and Metrics Lead (1): 35,000 OPMultisig Management/Ops Budget: 40,000 OPRetroactive Funding Reserve Bonus: 20,000 OPTotal: 170,000 OPHow should governance participants assess impact?User Experience KPIs:<5% of quality applicant drop off due to milestones issues<1 week turnaround from Grant completion to grants deliveryPerformance KPIs:Helping aid increase of TVL on Optimism in line with Season‚Äôs goals using these metrics: Total TVL, Stablecoin TVL, Wrapped Asset TVL, and Bridged Asset TVL.Helping aid increase of TVL on OP Chains using these metrics: Total TVL, Stablecoin TVL, Wrapped Asset TVL, and Bridged Asset TVL.Projects to be clawed back due to misunderstood timelines <5%Reviewing >95% of projects that have completed all milestones within 5 work days.Additional KPIs:Continuous decreased reliance on Foundation‚Äôs growth team for information on milestones and tracking and disbursements, subject to feedback from the Foundation; working closely with Foundation to keep on track.Justification for BudgetThis is the first season where the Milestones and Metrics team will be its own independent Council from the Grants Council, however, we expect to work very closely with the Grants Council as in prior seasons.For this reason, the Lead and each Reviewers‚Äô compensation will stay the same as S5 and S6. As mentioned above, the Foundation has recommended we increase the total team size to 4 to help with the increased quantity and scope of work.New to this season is the significant new responsibility of managing a multisig and taking over the fund disbursement task for all the grants from the Foundation. Specific details are still being worked out with the Foundation, and the proposed budget will fund the extra operational costs and bandwidth associated with this. Once the Council starts and understands the required workflow, an internal vote by the elected Milestones and Metrics Council members will be made to determine how to allocate this funding.There will be 3 Additional Signers to this multisig, 1 from the Developer Advisory Board and 2 from the Grants Council. These 3 Additional Signers will not be tasked with reviewing milestones and creating transactions, but will act as an additional layer of security to additionally check transactions. Each of these Additional Signers will receive the proposed allocations from the Reserve to compensate them for their time. Specific expectations around all signers are included in thecharter.New to this season is that similarly to the Grants Council‚Äôs proposedbudget, we will not be applying for Retroactive Funding. Our logic is very similar, in that the results of Retro funding often take at least a year to materialize, and even then, the impact is indirect and difficult to quantify. By focusing on our mandate and effectively holding teams accountable to their grant promises, ultimately driving TVL growth this season and executing on prior intents, this Reserve ensures our role remains distinct and avoids competing for funding in a program where its contributions are not easily comparable to other applicants, and lets future rounds focus on other projects. The Reserve is in line with the proposed Grant‚Äôs Council Reserve and is subject to change (decrease).",Summary not available

Elected  Representatives üíº,Developer Advisory Board - Season 7 Operating Budget,https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-season-7-operating-budget/9350,"Proposed Lead:Zach ObrontProposed Operating Budget:190,000 OP (+100,000 relative to previous Season)Contact Info:zobront@gmail.comPrevious Work & QualificationsI served as the Developer Advisory Board Lead for Season 6,delivering on our KPIsand working with the community to formalize and expand the role of the DAB.Outside of this role, I work primarily as asecurity researcher, with a focus on the OP ecosystem. For example, I placed 1st in theaudit contest on the Bedrock Upgrade, 1st in theaudit contest for Blast, and performed private audits for OP Labs, Base and Fraxtal.I organized and judged theFault Proof Audit Contest, which found multiple critical severity bugs in the Fault Dispute Game (leading to the fixes in theGranite upgrade).I led the buildout of the original version ofOP Succinct, the first upgrade to the OP Stack to allow teams to deploy full ZK validity proven chains.In a past life, I co-founded and ranScribe Media. This is irrelevant technically, but provided helpful experience in leading a team of 100+ people that carries over to this role.Board Charter:Link to S6 CharterLink to S7 Charter UpdatesTo summarize the changes:The DAB will expand its responsibilities from Season 6 based on requests by the Grants Council and Foundation.The Grants Council‚Äôs Audit Team will be disbanded, and responsibilities for the audit program will shift to the DAB. The DAB will be solely responsible for selecting projects for audit grants, while the GC will remain responsible for administering the grants.The DAB will be responsible for selecting applicants for all Foundation Missions (seeGuide to Season 7)The DAB will take an active role in crafting Missions, both by writing the ongoing Foundation Missions, and by providing support to the GC in writing Governance Missions. A Mission Scout role will be introduced to support with this responsibility.The DAB will provide ‚Äúdevrel for Missions‚Äù services, making ourselves available to help applicants through office hours, one on one questions, and exploring additional opportunities to attract more developers to contribute to the Collective.Given the large increase in responsibilities and the desire to keep the team from growing too much, we will shift feedback to the GC so that each project receives feedback from one DAB member, instead of two.Non-technical summaries by the DAB will be replaced by a detailed explanation of the DAB‚Äôs assessment of the safety and importance of the protocol upgrade. This will be shared by the Lead, and therefore the Upgrade Czar role will be removed.Breakdown of Council Operating Budget:All DAB members will be responsible for supporting Mission Applications. They will be divided into three subcommittees based on the types of applications they will be supporting.Lead (1)= 30k OP (+5k from last season)The Lead is responsible for ensuring that the DAB is both meeting its current objectives and finding opportunities to further support the Collective. This includes:(a) leading all board meetings and internal decisions.(b) overseeing the decisions and feedback of all subcommittees.(c) leading board discussions on approving protocol upgrades, and communicating these decisions (along with helpful voting context) to the community.(d) act as the tiebreaker for the Audit subcommittee and Foundation Mission subcommittee if the members disagree.(e) collaborating with other Council Leads to find opportunities to provide support across the collective.(f) tracking KPIs and drafting the Season 7 retrospective at the end of the season.Audit Request Team (2)= 12.5k OP each (-2.5k from last season in the GC)The Audit Request team will be responsible for evaluating and selecting applicants to provide subsidized audits for.They will start by using the existing Grants Council rubric and processes for this selection, but will be responsible for adapting these processes to achieve the best results. This includes coordinating with the Foundation‚Äôs Growth team to get their input on the value of various projects to the ecosystem.Eligibility Criteria: To be selected to the Audit Request Team, an applicant should have established themselves as a senior auditor, either with a role at a firm or through major successes in audit contests and bug bounties.Governance Mission Team (3)= 12.5k OP each (+2.5k from last season)The Governance Mission team will work with the Grants Council to provide technical feedback on all Mission applicants.Each cycle, applications will be divided between the members of this subcommittee, with one member providing feedback on each application providing their perspective on the technical feasibility, team quality, alignment of the project with the MR, appropriateness of budget, and other criteria that are helpful for the GC to make informed decisions on technical applications.Eligibility Criteria: To be selected to the Governance Mission Team, an applicant should have established themselves as a knowledgeable developer with a wide ranging understanding of the ecosystem. Ideally, they have directly contributed to important protocols or tools.Foundation Mission Team (2)= 12.5k OP each (new role)The Foundation Mission team will be responsible for selecting which teams are chosen to fulfill the Foundation Missions.These are larger grants with higher stakes, so these decisions will be slower and take a lot more thought, more like hiring than giving a grant.Eligibility Criteria: To be selected to the Foundation Mission Team, an applicant should have both deep technical knowledge and the ability to make high stakes assessments of teams and people. Ideally, they have worked in an engineering management role.OP Labs Representative (1)= 0 OP (equal to last season)The OP Labs Representative will provide support to all subcommittees of the DAB. With deeper knowledge of OP roadmap, they are able to act as a sanity check on priorities and decisions, and can provide extra support to whichever subcommittee has the highest work volume in a given cycle.After the election, the DAB will hold an internal vote to assign the following additional roles. These responsibilities will be taken on by existing members in addition to their subcommittee roles.Ops Lead (1)= 7.5k OP additional payment (equal to last season)The Ops Lead existed last season and was a crucial role in helping the DAB to manage a lot of details without dropping any balls. This role involves:(a) improving the IOPs,(b) scheduling meetings,(c) interfacing with other Councils,(d) organizing processes and tools for the DAB to perform its duties, and(e) looking for any other opportunities to make changes that will keep the DAB‚Äôs efforts focused and effectiveMission Scouts (2)= 7.5k OP additional payment (new role)This is a new role that will exist given the additional responsibility of crafting Missions. These two members will deeply understand the OP Labs roadmap, and be able to think creatively about missing gaps that Missions could fill. They must:(a) deeply understand the OP Labs roadmap, and thinking creatively about missing gaps that Missions could fill,(b) specifically, stay closely on top of interop developments, including protocol level changes and products being built,(c) conceptualizing, getting consensus on, drafting, and posting the ongoing Foundation Missions, and(d) working with the Grants Council to ensure their Mission process takes into account the specific technical outcomes that would most support the Collective.Finally, in line with theGrants Council BudgetandMilestones & Metrics Budget, we will be stepping away from any future compensation through RetroPGF. With that in mind, we will add aBonus Paymentof 50k OP (the same as was awarded to the S6 DAB in RetroPGF), to come at the end of the season and distributed in a way that will be determined along with the other Council Leads.KPIs & MeasurementsUser Experience KPIs:Did 100% of Protocol Upgrades have a non-technical summary posted within 72 hours and get approval or comments from the DAB?What NPS score would the Grants Council reviewers provide (answering: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1-10, if it were up to you, how likely would you be to renew the DAB next season?‚Äù)What NPS score would the Foundation give the DAB (answering: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1-10, if it were up to you, how likely would you be to renew the DAB next season?‚Äù)Performance KPIs:Did the number of Mission applicants increase in S7 as the DAB took on more devrel responsibilities to support applicants?Did the number of milestones missed by grant recipients decrease on DAB-approved grants relative to grants before the DAB?Did Missions authored by the DAB end up leading to meaningful technical progress, as evluated by the OP Labs team?",Summary not available
Elected  Representatives üíº,Anticapture Commission - Season 6 Retrospective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission-season-6-retrospective/9278,"Hello Collective, here is the Anticapture Commission‚Äôs Retrospective for Season 6.Reference:Season 6 - Anticapture Commission Amendment1. 	What is your assessment of the impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal at the start of the Season?Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?If not, why?Goal: Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens‚Äô House veto.Assessment: During the season, the ACC utilized the 10 million OP tokens delegated to the Commission‚Äôs multisig, and voted on all proposals that were subject to a Citizens‚Äô House veto. While casting the vote, the members of the ACC did not flag any instances of capture as a result of these governance proposals, that would put the governance at risk of capture to the benefit of any one individual or group.Goal: Provide alerts to the Citizens‚Äô House when capture occurs in the token house or during any proposal.Assessment: During the Season, the ACC did not receive any concern flagged by any member of the community indicating that a capture is likely to occur in the Token House governance. During the governance proposals of the Season, there were no instances where a risk was identified of any entity or group capturing governance.Apart from any flagged concerns, the ACC was active in discussing governance proposals that would eventually require the Citizen‚Äôs House inputs. One such proposal was the Accelerated Decentralization Proposal For Optimism, and the ACC initiated a discussion on this proposal with member Delegates, as well as the Foundation and the author of the proposal GFX labs.Additional and Aligned Goals:Goal: Increase votable supply- The ACC does not have a budget proposal, however one of the identified goals of the ACC was to increase the votable supply.Assessment: Since the Start of S6, the votable supply has increased by 18.5%, from 89.4m OP to 106m OP. This represents that the ACC has been able to achieve its KPI goal in terms of increased votable supply.Goal: Advocate for the continued decentralizationAssessment: The ACC initiated calls and discussions on furthering decentralization of various elements of Optimism. One suggestion was to have have additional voting UI/portals, so that the voting interface isn‚Äôt entirely dependent on Agora.2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?The ACC‚Äôs charter is to identify points of capture across the ecosystem, and utilize the OP delegated to the ACC to prevent the capture of Token Housetoken house by any one entity or group. To this extent, the output of the ACC‚Äôs members was able to support the overriding goals and charter of the ACC.Utilizing the OP tokens delegated to the ACC‚Äôs Multisig, the ACC voted on the Granite Network Upgrade Proposal and the Governor Update Proposal#3:Enable Onchain Treasury Execution, as these were the proposals in this Season of governance that were Subject to a Citizen‚Äôs House Veto, involving protocol and governance contract upgrades.3. What are the major problems you ran into over the course of the Season?During the Granite Network Upgrade, the members of ACC had flagged technical concerns with the way the proposal had been initiated, with the fallback mechanism being activated to disable fraud proofs. The Delegate members of ACC provided a suggestion to minimize such risks during network upgrade proposals. Although this did not involve a capture of the Token House, it was felt that the sudden introduction of the fall back mechanism could potentially lead to an attack or an incident, resulting in a compromise to the integrity of the network and requiring emergency remedial actions by the Security Council.During the season, ACC members also reported issues with the Agora voting portal, which were then outlined to the Agora team and subsequently resolved. Among the suggestions made to Agora was to allow voting delegates a brief period to change their cast votes if they notice an error, thereby providing an option for Delegates to revise or override their vote in cases of erroneous vote or UI malfunction.4. What are possible solutions that could be explored next Season?Some of the solutions that could be explored next season are:Apart from the current goals, the ACC could additionally help with the Milestone based Decentralization Model proposed by Foundation by being responsible to evaluate progress of decentralization across the layer and ensuring the various decentralization objectives are met. Also, the ACC can play a role in shepherding Phase II & Phase III, as outlined in the Accelerating Decentralization Proposal.Since the ACC serves as a system of checks and balances during critical situations that require Delegates to act on an emergency basis, if ACC members repeatedly abstain from voting on multiple proposals, a reprimand could be considered.If governance bandwidth permits, a dry-run for a capture situation could be experimented with.5. What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season?If you don‚Äôt believe the team‚Äôs operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.I recommend continuing the ACC for the next Season, with the similar identified goals of preventing capture in governance. The ACC given its limited scope, will likely continue to be a minimized governance meta-structure that can step in during emergency situations where there is a risk of capture in the Token House.Thank you to all Delegate Members of the ACC for their contributions, Members of the Foundation, and especially to Brichis and Max for their guidance throughout the Season.Web3magnetic.eth, ACC Season 6 Lead.",Summary not available

Elected  Representatives üíº,Security Council ‚Äî Season 6 Retrospective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-season-6-retrospective/9301,"Security Council Retrospective - Season 61. Assessment of Benchmark Milestones and KPIsThe Security Council (SC) did not submit a Budget Proposal for Season 6, as it is funded by the OP Foundation. However, key milestones and KPIs for Season 6 included:Successfully running the first Security Council election for Cohort A (completed).Meeting quorum for protocol upgrade signing ceremonies as an ongoing KPI (achieved throughout Season 6).Meeting liveness requirements (achieved throughout Season 6).The SC successfully achieved all its major milestones and KPIs during the Season.2. Impact AssessmentThe Security Council‚Äôs outputs strongly supportedIntent#1:Progress towards decentralization.Protocol Upgrades: The SC played a critical role in supporting upgrades aligned with Stage 1 decentralization requirements. The Security Council continued to impact the technical decentralization of Optimism.Elections: The successful completion of the first SC election for Cohort A was a significant step forward for the Optimism Collective‚Äôs decentralization goals. Completing this election contributed to the governance decentralization of Optimism.These efforts have advanced the Collective‚Äôs ability to operate in a decentralized manner, increasing the resilience of the protocol and the Security Council itself.3. Challenges FacedResourcing Limitations: The SC remains reliant on OP Labs for operational and technical support. While OP Labs is invaluable, this reliance could undermine the SC‚Äôs independence in the long term.Operational Friction: Compensation processing through the OP Foundation faced continued friction during the first half of the Season. This issue was resolved midway through Season 6 but highlighted inefficiencies in operational workflows.4. Suggested Improvements to OperationsTo address these challenges, the following solutions are proposed:Budget Autonomy: Allowing the SC to manage its own budget would improve operational efficiency, reduce reliance on the OP Foundation, and enhance resilience.Resourcing and Tools: Additional resources or tools to support technical independence could reduce the reliance on OP Labs and ensure the SC‚Äôs long-term sustainability.5. Adjustments to the MandateAs the Superchain governance framework evolves, the Security Council‚Äôs mandate should adapt to accommodate an extension in its responsibilities. The introduction of Blockspace Charters, temporary multisig structures, and the Superchain Registry may expand the scope of Security Council operations. To align with these changes, we propose addressing the following considerations on the next review of the Security Council‚Äôs mandate:Operational Changes: The Security Council should formalize processes for managing temporary multisig structures and integrating its operations with the Superchain Registry. These changes will ensure smoother coordination and clearer accountability for protocol upgrades involving multiple stakeholders.Emergency Procedures: Enhancing the Security Council‚Äôs emergency response mechanisms is critical to addressing risks such as governance capture or discrepancies in chain configurations. Clear, codified emergency procedures will empower the Security Council to act decisively while maintaining transparency. Any required infrastructure (such as third party apps or interfaces) should be put in place.Collaboration Tools: The Security Council should set up tools and workflows to facilitate seamless communication with key stakeholders, including the Optimism Foundation, Chain Governors, and other governance participants. This will ensure timely and effective decision-making across the Superchain.These adjustments aim to equip the Security Council with the necessary structure and flexibility to navigate the growing complexity of the Superchain while ensuring that its operations remain transparent, accountable, and aligned with the Optimism Collective‚Äôs guiding principles.6. Continuation of OperationsThe Security Council plays a critical element in the success of the OP Superchain. The scope and responsibilities of the Security Council should continue to evolve in a manner aligned with Blockspace Charters. Alongside evolving the technical scope of the Security Council, the Security Council should be equipped with the resources and budget to take on elements related to the execution of operations, building resilience and progressing continued decentralization of the OP collective.","Optimism's Security Council (SC) successfully completed Season 6, achieving all key milestones including its first election and maintaining quorum and liveness.  While its OP Foundation funding prevented a budget proposal, operational challenges included resource limitations and compensation processing friction.  Recommendations for improvement include budget autonomy, enhanced resourcing, and formalized processes for managing temporary multisigs and the Superchain Registry.  The SC's mandate should expand to encompass evolving Superchain governance, including improved emergency response and communication tools.  Continued SC operation is crucial for the OP Superchain's success and its ongoing decentralization.

Elected  Representatives üíº,Developer Advisory Board - Season 6 Retrospective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board-season-6-retrospective/9298,"The Developer Advisory Board came into its own this season, maturing from an experiment into a proper board with processes and significant impact on the Collective. It was amazing to see the results over the season, and we have many great ideas to expand that impact in future seasons.1. What is your assessment of the impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal at the start of the Season?The KPIs listed at the start of the season were:Did 100% of Protocol Upgrades have a non-technical summary posted within 72 hours and get approval or comments from the DAB? -YES!What NPS score would the Grants Council reviewers provide (answering: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1-10, if it were up to you, how likely would you be to renew the DAB next season?‚Äù) -10/10 (@Gonna.eth)What NPS score would the Citizens give the DAB (answering: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1-10, how much value do you feel the DAB provided the community this season?‚Äù) -6.86/10 (Telegram poll, 15 votes)Did voting participation on Protocol Upgrades increase (including abstains) since the non-technical summaries were implemented? -YES! Average total votes before summaries was 47M, after summaries was 56M, a 19% increase (data)Did the number of milestones missed by grant recipients decrease on DAB-approved grants relative to grants before the DAB? -It‚Äôs still too early to tellDid the quality of technical grants chosen increase, as evaluated by members of the OP Labs engineering team? -We were not able to gather this information2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?The DAB charter for this season included: (a) supporting the community in technical decisions like protocol upgrades, (b) supporting the GC in evaluating MR applications and (c) bringing additional technical perspective to the OP ecosystem (and exploring new ways we could support).On (a): We provided a plain English summary for the protocol upgrade this season. We also met with the OP Labs team to understand their roadmap, and have provided feedback on the Foundation‚Äôs Decentralization Roadmap and Product Vision, as well as the implementations of the Custom Gas Token and interop.On (b): We worked with the GC to provide detailed feedback on 179 Mission Request applications, which has proven to be very helpful in their evaluation process. We have integrated the DAB directly into Charmverse so we can engage directly with teams, and leave comments for the GC to consider. The Grant‚Äôs Council has given an NPS score of 10/10 for our help.On (c): We have hosted community calls to discuss additional ways to support the Collective in future seasons. Some of the big themes will be discussed below in#5. Additionally, many of us served as judges for Retro PGF 5.All in all, I feel the team was very successful in supporting the Intent.3. What are the major problems you ran into over the course of the Season?a) Early in the season, there was some work to hammer out logistics, but since that has all been buttoned up, things have run very smoothly.b) The big remaining problem is that it seems like there are so many ways the DAB can be helpful to the Collective, and only some of these ideas are being surfaced. Because we can‚Äôt see into every area of the organization, it‚Äôs hard to identify these opportunities. The community calls have been helpful, but I believe we can do a lot more.4. What are possible solutions that could be explored next Season?We‚Äôll continue to work closely with the GC to ensure our workflows fit nicely together, and host community calls to ask for the community‚Äôs support in seeing the areas of the Collective where we can provide the most value.It will also be helpful to integrate more closely with OP Labs, as having a clear vision for the product roadmap and technical details will allow us to serve as a kind of liaison to the community (for example, seeing opportunities for important Mission Requests, advising applicants about how their work fits in with potential future changes, etc.)5. What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season?With two seasons under our belts, the clear message seems to be that the DAB has many more ways to be useful, and can take on more responsibility within the Collective. Specifically, we are planning the following for S7:Take over the full program to assess audit requests from the Grants Council.Take full responsibility for selecting the teams that will deliver on Foundation Mission Requests.Take a more active approach to understanding the technical roadmap, and use this understanding to work with the Foundation to craft the rolling Foundation Mission Requests, and with the Grants Council to craft Governance Mission Requests.Experiment with acting as ‚Äúdev rel for the Collective‚Äù, playing a more active role in getting outside developers involved. For example, hosting office hours to help match developers with interesting projects, advising on writing good applications, a link to get in touch at the bottom of all Mission Requests, hosting demo days for completed MRs, etc.Explore an ongoing role for the DAB to help future Retro PGF rounds close the gap between badgeholders and the better results that expert voters achieved in RPGF 5.","The Developer Advisory Board (DAB) significantly exceeded expectations this season, evolving from a pilot program to a key Collective contributor.  All initial KPIs were met, including 100% protocol upgrade summarization and a 10/10 NPS score from the Grants Council. While community NPS was lower (6.86/10), voting participation increased by 19%.  The DAB successfully supported community technical decisions, aided grant application evaluations, and provided valuable technical perspectives.  Challenges included initially ironing out logistics and identifying all potential areas of support.  Future plans include expanded responsibilities, such as managing audit requests, mission request selection, and actively engaging external developers.  The DAB aims to become a central liaison between developers and the Collective, leveraging its expertise to enhance project selection and community engagement.

Elected  Representatives üíº,Code of Conduct Council - Season 6 Retrospective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-season-6-retrospective/9286,"CoCC -  Season 6 Retrospective1. What is your assessment of the impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal at the start of the Season?- Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?- If not, why?Reporter Experience KPIs:Response time and response rate on filed reports:respecting the season 6 council charter, a maximum of 5 labor days has been the rule for the council to identify and propose solutions to the cases that have appeared. Faster responses have happened with cases ofsevere violationsto the rules of engagement.Number of reports that de-escalated without enforcement actions:3Number of reports with enforcement actions:1Number of cases referred to mediation:1Accountability and transparency around the due processing of cases with recurrent posting on the forum:Threads for this purpose:Accountability reports S6,CoCC communication thread& this retrospective post.Number of updates to charters and operating procedures to match the functionality of the council to the evolving seasonal nature of Optimism:1 Update to the council charter, giving more clarity to the boundaries and scope of sanctions that can be enforced by the CoCC.Availability and ease of access to the council with monthly office hours where the community can raise or get information on cases processed: By the end of this season the CoCC delivers 4 public office hours, regular private weekly council meetings and someCFCmeetings with participation of the council‚Äôs lead.Performance KPIs:Number of community members that disengage/resign/offboard due to unmanaged conflict:From the council‚Äôs perspective, no community members have disengaged due to unmanaged conflict in season 6. Parties involved in cases have continued contributing to the collective, and only sanctioned members have been kept aside as a measure to protect the community and the boundaries for engagement.None, or least amount of token votes regarding Conflict management actions related to implementing rules of engagement:There was no additional voting overhead created from the code of conduct council duties. There was one snapshot vote that created governance overhead in the collective, but it was not related to the competencies of this council.Separate the collective from the visibility of conflicts managed, and their outcomes:We have ensured due diligence and confidentiality for the cases, successfully protecting the perceived wellbeing of the community and removing governance overhead from foundation and other participants.Mid and end-season analysis from the council about patterns identified in cases, to signal improvement opportunities:Mid season report already shared in the forum, and end of season report to be posted before 28th nov, at the ‚ÄúCoCC accountability reports S6‚Äù threadIndividual ideas From members:Juan‚Äôs take:Yes. This season we‚Äôve contributed to the wellbeing of the collective by managing the load from conflicting situations. We think that we could have made more impact in the community with preventive measures and education towards the desired types of interactions.Alex‚Äôs take:Yes, we have made progress towards the notion of de-escalating without enforcement actions while replacing the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct Violations.Pumbi‚Äôs take:Yes, we have worked on achieving all the KPIs proposed at the beginning of the season. We provided support to all parties where conflict situations arose and effectively removed this workload from the Foundation.Fuji‚Äôs take:Yes, we have made meaningful progress against the KPIs outlined at the start of the season. Our team has actively managed various conflicts, provided support to collectives and contributed to a more positive community experience. By addressing conflicts and taking on roles previously managed by the Foundation, we have helped shift the workload, resulting in more purposeful enforcement of the Code of Conduct within the group. While we have effectively achieved our conflict resolution goals, there is an opportunity to further strengthen proactive engagement through prevention education and clearer communication of expected behavior.CryptoReuMD‚Äôstake: Yes, our goal was to ensure timely responses and make the language of forms and communication kinder and more accessible for vulnerable members submitting reports. We aimed to respond cohesively as a team, working together as one interconnected network to meet deadlines and milestones effectively.Oxytocin‚Äôs take:Based on the KPIs established, this season the Council has accomplished what was set. Focussing on the experience for the token house, the Council has been able to successfully de-escalate conflicts which I believe could have ended up in a strong forum escalation were we not present to offer a solution. Additionally, the appropriate communication and responses were drafted on time, allowing for transparency for the delegates who have elected us.2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?Juan‚Äôs take:Our work is key to achieve the desired governance decentralization in the collective. Every member of this season‚Äôs council has been really professional and committed to their required duties of being a sensory node to the collective, opening paths to listen and process behavioral episodes without creating governance overhead.Alex‚Äôs take:I think we are on the right track, but changes are definitely required in the domain of this council. The outputs are relatively neutral, since several of the cases were simply outside our scope.Fuji‚Äôs take:We are working to improve transparency and accountability through updates to the IOP process and a more inclusive report form. We also handle reports from the community. These actions support the CoCC‚Äôs goal of strengthening collective value and increasing community trust.Pumbi‚Äôs take:The general feeling of the members of this Council is that by having a broader scope of action we would have achieved a more tangible impact on the Collective. We feel that the CoCC is currently dependent on other structures and cannot exercise or reinforce decisions autonomously without the intervention of other parties.CryptoReuMD‚Äôs take:This council season has shown us the importance of evolving our governance framework to meet the Collective‚Äôs growing needs. While we‚Äôve made significant strides in decentralizing decision-making and ensuring each council member serves as a crucial point, there‚Äôs still room to amplify our impact. Expanding our scope would allow for more decisive action, strengthening our shared vision by balancing autonomy with transparency and accountability.Oxytocin‚Äôs take:The team was able to do everything within their new scope established this season, with the key term in this question being ‚Äòauthorized‚Äô . We were able to fully accomplish everything with the tools being given, but in some cases, we would receive reports that we were not authorised to act upon, which while frustrating should not be counted towards the final impact.3. What are the major problems you ran into over the course of the Season?Juan‚Äôs take:The perception of the CoCC as only a punitive body, and not so much of a group that can intentionally support the awareness and embodiment of the collective values inside the rules of engagement and the code of conduct.Alex‚Äôs take:I think a big problem is receiving reports from third parties expecting us to act on something that is out of our control (which is frustrating for both parties).Fuji‚Äôs take:There are limitations on the CoCC‚Äôs authority to deal with issues that occur outside of the our platform, as seen in the reports on the Oekaki and Base communities. I think we can benefit from getting more community feedback about the perception of the CoCC‚Äôs duty in regards to neutrality and visibility.Pumbi‚Äôs take:Basically the limitation in our field of action. People come to us looking for a concrete solution to a problem that arises and in most cases the situation is out of our scope and our hands are tied.CryptoReuMD‚Äôs take:This is a very interesting question. I feel that we have high walls around our boundaries that prevent us from reaching and helping people effectively. Perhaps having a more private or encrypted way of communicating with the community could help decentralize our response process.Oxytocin‚Äôs take:I do not want to repeat what my colleagues have expressed, so instead of covering the lack of scope of action covered before, another major problem has been the lack of cohesive communication with other bodies of the token house.As elected members of only the Token house , our scope might always be limited, but I found that even within the Token House our interdepartmental coordination could have been improved. Luckily, the reports that were related to governing bodies were limited this season, but I felt that if a situation were to arise, we could have acted much quicker if these connections were pre-established.4. What are possible solutions that could be explored next Season?Juan‚Äôs take:I would love to see the CoCC more involved in educational efforts towards the embodiment of the collective values. This season there was an RFP that included some cultural education sessions, and the community did not receive them because the third party didn‚Äôt deliver fully the RFP. I think the collective should not miss this important aspect because of grants not being delivered fully.Alex‚Äôs take:Turn the Council into a general reporting service (one-stop shop for complaints) and, instead of giving decision-making power, provide admin people and communication channels to quickly contact whoever is necessary (and close the ticket until the case is processed by the actor in question).Pumbi‚Äôs take:That the CoCC has more authority to be able to exercise actions, as an example: the Lead should have permissions in the forum to hide a post and not dep end on the availability of a govNERD for this task. In short, more freedom of action.Fuji‚Äôs take:Developing more resources or checklists for team members to follow in handling standard cases can help us maintain consistency and ensure that actions taken are aligned with the Code of Conduct.CryptoReuMD‚Äôs take:I believe that the sensory nodes we‚Äôve established should interconnect between sessions, as the learning process delays the group‚Äôs actionability. Being a council member it‚Äôs a great honor, but we also need to work for the people that it‚Äôs outside and doesn‚Äôt have timing or season reflection periods.Oxytocin:As we are only empowered by the votes given by the Token House, I am not sure we can resolve the lack of authority for some actions. Instead , I feel there are two actions that might be worth exploring this season.Firstly, it might be worth exploring a renaming of the Code of Conduct council. The current name might suggest to outsiders that the scope extends much beyond our reach, and perhaps we should consider a term that makes it clear from the onset what our mission and abilities are. We would receive reports from private campaigns and discord servers that were optimism related, but realistically we could not exert any action upon. Perhaps something like the Governance Accountability Commission could convey a clearer meaning?Additionally, I believe deeper connection with other bodies of the Council could be beneficial. For instance, each council member could be assigned as a point of contact for some of the governance bodies (eg. Anti-capture commission, Grants Councils. etc), which would facilitate both the ability of asking clarifications from these bodies, as well as serve as a confidant were these institutions to have problems worth reporting as well.5. What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season?Juan‚Äôs take:Having feedback forms for the community to review the council‚Äôs perception of impact.Include CoCC contributions for governance retro funding rounds, same as of other councils of the collective.Giving the CoCC lead platform admin capacities to enforce the sanctions described in the rules of engagement.Support and follow up execution of proactive actions towards education and embodiment of collective valuesAlex‚Äôs take:I think we need broader and deeper spaces for conversation, especially if we want to take on initiatives beyond the analysis of reports.Fuji‚Äôs take:We suggest that the CoCC has a clearer process to strengthen the involvement of third parties, as arbiters of complex conflicts. Improvements incoordination across platforms and authorities will support the CoCC‚Äôs role in fostering harmonious communities in the future.Pumbi‚Äôs take:Modifying the scope is definitely an almost mandatory point to take into account. In my opinion the CoCC is a very valuable structure, but today it is not being used in the best way and we assume that the general opinion of the Collective is that ‚Äúthis council is not as important as other structures or does not generate a real impact‚Äù.CryptoReuMD take:Tooling, in this season we started using token gated access to documents, also we are using google meet for sessions and communication via email, and im sure that we can also make some sessions and create applications for the COCC.Oxytocin:As can be implied from my last answer, I believe that the conceptual mandate of the council is important, but requires a subtle honing to make it more intuitive. Placing greater emphasis on governance accountability for the rules of engagement would still allow us to act on rules of engagement and severe violations, but without the implied need of, for example, enforcing behavior from other chains or initiatives that are optimism-related but not enforceable by us.Finally, while we have built a very strong procedure for outside reports, the council could also have a more proactive role by actively looking out for the wellbeing of other representatives of the collective.6. (optional) If you don‚Äôt believe the team‚Äôs operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.We think that the code of conduct council is an important representative structure in the Optimism collective, since it decentralizes the monitoring and enforcement of the rules of engagement from the foundation, to the community, along with the autonomy and credibly neutrality that comes from electing and monitoring its members seasonally. That is why we encourage the continuity of this council for future seasons.Thanks@Pumbi@alexsotodigital@Oxytocin@CryptoReuMD@fujiar@juankbellfor contributing to the season 6 Code of conduct council in the Optimism collective","The Optimism Collective's Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) Season 6 retrospective reveals successful conflict resolution, exceeding response time KPIs, and deflecting governance overhead.  However, limitations arose from a perceived punitive role, handling out-of-scope reports, and lacking authority for proactive measures.  Council members suggest expanding the mandate to include preventative education, clearer communication, increased authority (e.g., forum moderation), and improved inter-departmental coordination to maximize impact and community trust.  Continued CoCC operation is deemed crucial for decentralized governance.

Elected  Representatives üíº,Guidance on Representative Structure Mandates,https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-representative-structure-mandates/9320,"The Evolution of Representative Structures in Season 7All representative structures in the Collective should work to achieve ourSeason 7 Intent.In determining Season 7 mandates, the Foundation will transition more autonomy to Prospective Leads. There are a few required stipulations, but otherwise the Foundation will  transition to an advisory role in the creation of Charters.The Foundation has waited to share new information about the evolution of representative structures until November 26th in order to:facilitate more focus on last Season‚Äôs performance (retrospectives) before focusing on how representative structures should evolve for the next Seasonreduce the advantage for incumbents. New entry and competition are critical parts of a healthy governance system and it‚Äôs important to have competitive proposals for representative structures, such as thealternative Season 6 DAB renewal proposalsfor example. To better facilitate this, the Foundation has created generalizedCharter,Budget, andInternal Operating Procedures.Timeline for Prospective LeadsNovember 26th:Budget Proposal WorkshopDane Lund, the previous Grants Council Lead, will facilitate a workshop on Budget Proposal creation on November 26th at 4PM GMT, which will not be recorded.November 26th to December 4th:All prospective Leads can draft and post Operating Budgets for Season 7.Drafts are due on December 4th at 19:00 GMT.December 5th - December 11th:Reserved for community feedback, discussion, and incorporation before these budgets move to a vote. The Collective Feedback Commission will play an active role in providing guidance and feedback and facilitating broader community conversations about Operating Budgets.All Operating Budgets require 4 Top 100 delegate approvals, which are due by December 11th at 19:00 GMTDecember 12th - December 18th:Operating Budgets will be voted on by the Token HouseDecember 19th:Members can nominate themselves for any Council, Budget, or Board using the process outlined here (Coming soon!)Nominations must be posted on the forum by January 3rd at 19:00 GMTSecurity Council candidates need 8 Top 100 delegate approvals by January 7th at 19:00 GMTJanuary 8th:Elections!January 26th:Internal Operating ProceduresAll Councils, Commissions, and Board Leads are responsible for publishing Internal Operating Procedures within 10 days of the start of Season 7.Foundation GuidanceBelow is the Foundation‚Äôs guidance on the evolution of each structure. Unless  marked as ‚Äúrequired,‚Äù these are suggestions which may be incorporated at the Prospective Lead‚Äôs discretion. The Collective Feedback Commission and the Foundation are available to provide feedback on early drafts (please tag@maxwellto facilitate feedback.)What‚Äôs a legislative role versus an executive function?Legislative roles develop policy on behalf of the Collective (for example, the policy by which grants are distributed from the Governance Fund.) Legislative roles are elected as legislation is created on behalf of tokenholders.See theDecision Diagramfor more context.What‚Äôs a civil servant?A civil servant is a non-elected role that completes executive functions that benefit the Collective. Civil servants complete important actions for the Collective and are meant to be non-political.See theDecision Diagramfor more context.Grants Council: Selection(Module I)  / Legislative StructureMembers of the Grants Council are elected to fulfill legislative duties. Specifically, the Grants Council selects which contributors will complete work supported by the Governance Fund.The scope of the Grants Council will no longer be restricted to OP Mainnet. The Grants Council may make grants to applicants deploying across the Superchain, so long as the grants work towards the success metrics.The Grants Councilis requiredto make grants that drive the ****success metrics outlined in theGrants Council Missionbut may follow whatever grants process it would like to do so. That means the Grants Council may use the existing Mission framework, or choose to use a different framework. It is at the discretion of the Grants Council to continue the Superchain grants program, or not. Selection criteriamustbe published on the forum before any grants are made (public rubrics, etc.)The Grants Council will be asked to reserve 500k OP to evaluate grants for a pre-approved list of applicants as part of theDecision Market experiment.The Grants Council may consider requiring the Token House to approve any grant over 1.5M OP and/or any grant proposed by a member of the Grants Council.It is requiredthat the Grants Council make grants in accordance with theCollective Grant Policiesand any other compliance requirements.Milestones and Metrics Council:Module H / Executive StructureIt is requiredthat that the Milestone and Metrics function become its own Council for four important reasons:The Milestones and Metrics function falls within the category of one of the most important functions in the collective: measuring impact. Measurement is an executive function, which means members on the Milestones and Metrics council should be fulfilled by civil servants, rather than elected representatives. While we need to develop more robust infrastructure in order to identify the most qualified civil servants to fulfill these functions, in the future this structure should transition to a non-elected model. In contrast, the Grants Council fulfills a legislative function, which should continue to be elected.Milestones and Metrics Members perform a fundamentally different role than Grants Council Reviewers. While the Grants Council Reviewersselectapplicants, the Milestone and Metrics committeeevaluatesand measures impact. This requires different skills, operations, and tooling.In Season 7, the Milestones and Metrics Council will manage a community multisig, delivering grants to recipients selected by the Grants Council. Separating the Milestones and Metrics committee out as its own structure, enables more efficient multisig management. The Foundation recommends adding 1+ members to the Milestones and Metrics Council to support the additional workload of delivering grants.The Grants Council is currently too large, violating ourDesign Principlethat effective teams are < 14 people. Separating Milestones and Metrics into its own Council, will allow both Councils to operate more effectively.The Foundation will work closely with the Milestones and Metrics Council to develop a robust output measurement system, which further automates the milestones tracking process.Security Council:Modules M-O / Executive StructureMembers of the Security Council are elected to fulfill executive functions. In the future, we believe executive structures should not be elected as execution functions should be executed by non-political civil servants. However, we need to develop more robust infrastructure in order to identify the most qualified civil servants to fulfill these functions.Elections for Cohort B will run alongside all other elections in Season 7. Details to follow.The mandate of the Security Council is not meant to change in relation to a Season‚Äôs Intents as the mandate of the Security Council is primarily determined by our level of technical decentralization.The Security Council executes mission critical work, which we don‚Äôt believe should rely on Retro Funding while the program is still in the early stages of development. Therefore, the Security Council may request an operating budget from the Governance Fund in Season 7 as the Foundation will no longer provide stipends to members.Code of Conduct Council:No Module / Institutional StructureThe Code of Conduct Council serves as an institutional structure which defines ethics and expectations.Members of the Code of Conduct Council are elected. While having an enforceable Code of Conduct is important, the Foundation believes having it enforced by an elected Council presents unnecessary and undesirable conflicts of interest.The Code of Conduct Council has played a valuable role in our experimentation to enforce the Code of Conduct in a decentralized and governance minimized way. All contributors to the Code of Conduct Council in both Season 5 and Season 6 have made important contributions to the Collective‚Äôs iterative and experimental approach to governance.However, the Foundation believes the role played by the Code of Conduct Council should be transitioned to non-politically selected (non-elected) members of a contribution path.Accordingly, the Foundation has put forward aCouncil Dissolution proposalin Season 7, which will be subject to approval by the Token House.Prospective Leads that believe the CoCC should continue to exist, may still submit an Operating Budget proposal at their discretion.Developer Advisory Board:Modules I and K / LegislativeMembers of the Developer Advisory Board are elected to fulfill legislative duties. Specifically, the Developer Advisory Board advises the Grants Council on selecting the contributors that complete work supported by the Governance Fund. The Developer Advisory Board also advises governance participants on Protocol Upgrades.The Developer Advisory Board will be asked to select applicants for Foundation Mission Requests. The Developer Advisory Board will continue to advise the Grants Council as determined by both structures in collaboration.The Developer Advisory Board may also be called on to perform expert evaluation if/when expert, qualitative assessment of impact is required.The Foundation encourages the Developer Advisory Board to play a larger role in Protocol Upgrades, drafting Mission Requests (if and when applicable) and / or helping builders make contributions better aligned with OP Labs‚Äô roadmap.Anticapture Commission:Governing Policy Module / Institutional StructureThe Anticapture Commission serves as an institutional structure that defines ethics and expectations around capture resistance in the Collective.Commission membership is programmatically determined, currently by voting power and participation, but membership selection criteria may benefit from experimentation to identify the best-suited participants.The Foundation originally proposed this program to last for two Seasons, the original time frame thought necessary to onboard the first set of OP Chains. As this onboarding has taken longer than initially expected.The Anticapture Commission may put forward a proposal to continue to receive delegation through the Governance Fund or may continue to operate, as a sort of interest group, via organic delegations only. The process to Amend the Anticapture Commission proposal, so that it may continue to receive delegation, is outlinedhere.Collective Feedback Commission:Governing Policy Module / Institutional StructureThe Collective Feedback Commission serves as an institutional structure which works with the Foundation to define the process by which governing policies are brought in front of governance. This is similar to the institutional role the Core Development Program plays in defining the process by which protocol upgrades are brought in front of governance.Commission membership is programmatically determined, currently by verifiable metagovernance contributions, but we are actively experimenting with membership selection models.The Collective Feedback Commission has already begun its second iteration, as outlined in thisCharter. The Collective Feedback Commission provides services directly to the Foundation and so does not go through a governance process.","Season 7 of the Collective refines its representative structures.  The Foundation transitions to an advisory role, empowering Prospective Leads with greater autonomy in creating Charters and Budgets.  A timeline is established for budget proposals (November 26th-December 18th) and elections (December 19th-January 8th).  Structural changes include the Milestones and Metrics Council becoming a separate, civil servant-led entity, while the Code of Conduct Council's future is subject to a Token House vote.  Other Councils (Grants, Security, Developer Advisory Board) maintain their roles, with some expanded mandates and revised selection processes. The Anticapture and Collective Feedback Commissions continue, with ongoing experimentation on membership selection.

Elected  Representatives üíº,Collective Feedback Commission Communication Thread,https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-feedback-commission-communication-thread/9270,"Welcome to the CFC Communication Thread!The Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) was piloted beginning in Season 5 as part of thepath to open metagovernance.As outlined in the Collective‚ÄôsWorking Constitution, the Foundation‚Äôs role is to bootstrap the governance system of the Collective over multiple years, gradually bringing more governance rights online until the system can manage itself. Metagovernance refers to the ability to propose changes to the design of the governance system. Given the importance of this responsibility, metagovernance is the last governance responsibility that will be transferred to the community.The CFC serves as an experimental training ground to develop a ‚ÄúCore Governance Program‚Äù that will allow the Collective to take on metagovernance responsibilities in the future. The inspiration for this program is Core Development Programs. The goal of the CFC is to enable the Foundation to become just one of many Core Governors proposing metagovernance proposals in the future (similar to how OP Labs is just one of many Core Developers proposing protocol upgrades.)ResponsabilitiesThe next iteration of the CFC began on November 4th and will run through the end of Season 7.Individual members of the Collective Feedback Commission will:Provide feedback on early Foundation design drafts, roadmaps, frameworks, etc.Participate in broader design discussions with the Foundation via monthly meetingsProvide feedback on community authored Mission Requests to ensure they align with Season 7 Intents and/or other strategic initiativesExecute on contributions as scoped by the Foundation (members of the Design Research track will do this via Project Partnerships)Note: The Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as an input but is not obligated to incorporate any individual piece of feedback or implement the recommendations in any contribution. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission members, and may be made publicly viewable by the entire community at the end of the Commission‚Äôs term. The Foundation will provide summaries of the impact of all contributions.Foundation Track Leads will:To the best of our ability, request feedback on regular feedback cycles.

Elected  Representatives üíº,Zach Obront - Developer Advisory Board Operating Budget,https://gov.optimism.io/t/zach-obront-developer-advisory-board-operating-budget/8141,"Proposed Board Lead:Zach ObrontProposed Board Operating Budget:90,000 OP (+20k from last season)Contact Info:zobront@gmail.comPrevious Work & QualificationsI work primarily as asecurity researcher.My work focuses substantially on the OP ecosystem. For example, I placed 1st in theaudit contest on the Bedrock Upgrade. I‚Äôve also audited Base, Blast, and Fraxtal (all OP stack chains).I am organizing theFault Proof CTFevent this summer, which will serve as the final line of defense for the security of fault proofs before deploying to mainnet.I served on the Developer Advisory Board for Season 5, taking an active role in streamlining DAB processes to ensure the members were well coordinated.In my work with the DAB, I provided private feedback to the Grants Council, as well as providing public feedback on many Mission Requests and applications (ex:1,2,3).In a past life, I co-founded and ranScribe Media. This is irrelevant technically, but provided helpful experience in leading a team of 100+ people that will carry over to this role.Board Charter:Link to original Charter:Season 5 CharterThe Developer Advisor Board should be greatly expanded in Season 6 to make better use of the technical expertise of the group.Here is the proposed & expanded charter:Support the Optimism community through important technical decisions.Provide plain English explanations of all protocol upgrades for the community.Act as one of four delegate approvals that will be required before a Protocol Upgrade can move to a vote.Be available for consultation by delegates regarding important technical decisions, especially protocol upgrades.Support the Grants Council on evaluation technical Mission Requests.Review Mission Request drafts and provide guidance to the Grants Council, specifically focusing on their technical merits and whether the grant size is reasonable.Review applications for Mission Requests and provide guidance to the applicants as well as the Grants Council, specifically focusing on the team‚Äôs detailed plan and whether they seem to be capable of executing on the mission.Review work product delivered for milestones on existing grants to provide guidance on whether the milestones have been successfully achieved.Use ‚Äúveto power‚Äù to keep Grants Council technically grounded (ie. a unanimous ‚Äúno‚Äù vote by the DAB on any of these topics will block the Grants Council from voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù).Bring an additional technical perspective to thinking about the vision of the OP ecosystem and what needs to happen to get there.Be available for discussions for any core OP devs to provide an outside voice on technical and security related decisions.Support in finding technical talent to fill important roles at OP Labs.Generate ideas for theBuilders Ideaslist to spur community contributions.Other Logistics:All members will be accountable to governance as they remain removable via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in theOperating ManualBreakdown of Board Operating Budget:Lead (1)= 25k OP (+5k from last season)The increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities based on the changes outlined in this proposal.Specifically, the Lead will be responsible for:(a) leading all board meetings,(b) interfacing with other areas in OP governance to ensure the DAB is supporting where possible,(c) working with Upgrade Czar on approving protocol upgrades,(d) providing feedback for DAB members on their performance,(e) exercising decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus, and(f) writing & sharing the retrospective after Season 6 on changes to improve the DAB going forward.Upgrade Czar (1)= 17.5k OP (+5k from last season)This role did not exist last season. All Members were paid 12.5k OP, and the increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities.Specifically, the Upgrade Czar is responsible for:(a) understanding the OP Stack deeply and reviewing all upgrades,(b) leading the DAB in discussing and approving these upgrades, and(c) writing up non-technical summaries of the changes for the communityOps Lead (1)= 17.5k OP (+5k from last season)This role did not exist last season. All Members were paid 12.5k OP, and the increase in pay for this role represents the increase in responsibilities.Specifically, the Ops Lead is responsible for ensuring that all DAB tasks are well orchestrated and happen on time, including:(a) improving the IOPs,(b) scheduling meetings,(c) interfacing with other Councils,(d) organizing spreadsheets for feedback, and(e) looking for any other opportunities to make changes that will keep the DAB‚Äôs efforts focused and effectiveOP Labs Representative (1)= 0 OP (equal to last season)Additional Members (3)= 10k OP each = 30k OP (-7.5k from last season)All Members were paid 12.5k OP last season, but also shared some of the responsibilities that will be taken on by the other roles this season.I believe 10k OP is sufficient to incentivize top talent to participate, especially given the possibility for RetroPGF.Note: If you‚Äôre paying close attention, you‚Äôll see that the math on the changes doesn‚Äôt exactly add up. This is because, last season, one of the members (Noah) was unpaid. However, this budget includes the ‚Äúworst case‚Äù assumption that all Members are paid, although it is possible that Noah (or someone else) opts to forfeit compensation.KPIs & MeasurementsUser Experience KPIs:Did 100% of Protocol Upgrades have a non-technical summary posted within 72 hours and get approval or comments from the DAB?What NPS score would the Grants Council reviewers provide (answering: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1-10, if it were up to you, how likely would you be to renew the DAB next season?‚Äù)What NPS score would the Citizens give the DAB (answering: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1-10, how much value do you feel the DAB provided the community this season?‚Äù)Performance KPIs:Did voting participation on Protocol Upgrades increase (including abstains) since the non-technical summaries were implemented?Did the number of milestones missed by grant recipients decrease on DAB-approved grants relative to grants before the DAB?Did the quality of technical grants chosen increase, as evaluated by members of the OP Labs engineering team?","Zach Obront proposes leading Optimism's expanded Season 6 Developer Advisory Board (DAB), with a $90,000 OP budget.  His extensive experience in security research (including auditing OP stack chains and organizing the Fault Proof CTF) and leadership (co-founding Scribe Media) qualifies him. The expanded DAB will provide technical expertise, support protocol upgrades, advise the Grants Council, and enhance community engagement.  The budget allocates funds for the Lead ($25,000), Upgrade Czar ($17,500), Ops Lead ($17,500), and three additional members ($10,000 each). Key performance indicators (KPIs) focus on user experience (NPS scores from Grants Council and community) and performance (increased voting participation, fewer missed grant milestones, improved grant quality).

Elected  Representatives üíº,Code of Conduct Council - Retrospective Season 5,https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-retrospective-season-5/8064,"Retrospective - Season 5First of all,thank youfor allowing the members of this Council for Season 5 to be part of the Collective. We have learned a lot and worked in favor of the participants of the Collective. We have conducted this Retrospective internally and want to share some important points with all of you.Please note that in some responses, there are various conclusions. We believe that seeing the different perspectives of the members is more important than reaching a consensus when submitting a Retrospective.1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?We believe we have achieved progress based on our mandate, there has been less governance overhead in the management of conflicts by the Foundation, and less voting around the Code of Conduct sanctions, contributing to theseGoals, by replacing the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct Violations and eliminating enforcement responsibilities for Token House delegates by entrusting the Code of Conduct Council to process disputes. To create accountability for the Code of Conduct Council, the Token House may veto enforcement actions at any timeGenerally, the introduction of Optimistic Enforcement of actions alone has already led to fewer votes needed from the Token House on these matters, we think we were effective at these goals.While the CoCC wasn‚Äôt perfect, we successfully achieved these goals by soaking up governance overhead that would have otherwise fallen on the token. Our small group size (as opposed to the large Token House) meant we could dedicate more time and attention to each case than the Token House could, which would have ideally led to more optimal outcomes for the cases. Finally, the fact the CoCC Members were drawn from rank-and-file members of the Optimism Community, increased the decentralization of Optimism Governance and minimized the need of the Foundation to remain in control.2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?All reports were discussed, with different perspectives being given for each case from members. The biggest output I am impressed with the Council has been the communications on the thread, with many members being able to handle publicly very sensitive threads.We managed cases that were a load on the Foundation and the community, taking off weight to specific areas and taking care of the public image of the collective. Managing conflict is one of those areas whose impact is invisible, and trying to measure it is paradoxical. It‚Äôs hard to reach a consensus in dicotomic situations and there will be a certain amount of descent to decisions we make. If we want to have conflict, to prove our capacity to manage it, we are incentivizing the first unwanted premise. If there are a few conflicts, we may think the group is not needed. It‚Äôs good that the conflict management offices are prepared for any emergency, and also that there are moments without conflict that prevention.I think it‚Äôs less important to discuss the team‚Äôs outputs, and more important to focus on the indirect benefit to the Optimism Collective that the CoCC provided. Our inner workings and outputs ultimately minimized governance overhead for the Token House, increased decentralization of the Collective, and led to better outcomes among disputes. Our group activities and communication across Optimism‚Äôs online platform and community events appeared to reduce the frequency of disputes, reduce incivility on the online platforms, and provide a support mechanism to community members who felt they had been wronged or generally unsafe in the community; i.e. We were always there if people needed us, and it appeared as if many in the community knew this.3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP‚Äôs)?Incentivizing people in the community to be closer to the COCC. We should be able to know about conflicts when they are small. If we are not seen close to the community, it will be harder to access cases and we‚Äôll only perceive them when they are big.I think an important goal is to keep the IOPs simple, clear, and easy to understand and adhere to. With this as a goal, I am pleased that the CoCC did indeed dedicate significant time and energy to creating and/or refining the IOPs, while always seeking feedback from the community and the Foundation.4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter.Open the forms to not only strong Code of Conduct violations but also tearings of the social fabric, allowing feedback loops and notification of issues when they are small as fast as possible. Leading to not only Yes or No decisions, but to transforming polarities into informed dialogue spaces.A change that I‚Äôve previously discussed, is that Reports should be received, processed, and reported on with 2 consecutive Voting Cycles, and not only one (i.e. the same) Voting Cycle. I believe this change would improve decision-making by the CoCC reduce pressures on CoCC Members and minimize conflicts among CoCC Members.Giving more space for innovation within the CoCC to innovations, for example, for this initial Season we started exploring within the Council the option to use Attestations within our decisions and roles, this was something that wasn¬¥t part of the Charter, but I believe adding within the Charter a research or investigative area that includes an open mandate to innovate as Council would be seen by the members as an open playground. I also believe that working more closely with other members of the community generates a broader impact, for example, in future mandates, the CoCC can work more closely in experimenting under Missions or similar. Cross-collaboration is key, for the Attestations a member of the community,@LauNaMu, helped us understand more about Attestations and how these could be implemented within the Council in favor of the Collective. Something that also was in our conversations, was to see how could the CoCC could work together with other Protocols, such as Arbitrum, for issues that expand our borders, and are out of our scope, but still relevant to the Collective.5. What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season? If you don‚Äôt believe the team‚Äôs operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.I feel that ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) and report voting could be parallelized. The Council‚Äôs role in voting on behalf of the Token House cannot be assumed by any other entity, however, with additional resources we could expand and potentially onboard a more comprehensive method for resolutions beyond the council members themselves.I think we should continue next season, and be given support to pivot cases to facilitation of ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution). I think this experiment was fun and beneficial to the community and the participants of the COCC (Code of Conduct Council). In my opinion, for next season we can continue polishing and iterating based on what was built to support the community and the foundation in the better identification and processing of code of conduct violations and overall management of conflicts in the Optimism ecosystem.I think there can be two parallel streams to handle Reports. While the CoCC should remain the first ‚Äòport-of-call‚Äô or ‚Äòfirst responder‚Äô for all Reports, the CoCC should have the option to off-ramp selected cases to an external ADR body or process. The external ADR provider could provide increased expertise and dedicated time and staff for the longer term (supported or created by adequate funding) that could better handle these embedded, but recoverable disputes, in comparison to the direct CoCC. Cases that are not off-ramped to ADR would remain the responsibility of the CoCC, and the CoCC could increase the specialization, efficiency, and effectiveness in investigating, processing, adjudicating, and reporting on cases that lean more to obvious abuse, infractions, or breaches, as opposed to the human, personality or political disputes that are more likely breakdowns in the social fabric of the community but can still be recovered (i.e. these cases are handled by the ADR body).The mandate of the CoCC is of high importance to the Collective because due process is required when members of the Token House are subject to any kind of sanction, especially when this sanction involves not only deleting a post but also imposing higher sanctions such as limiting their ability to participate in the Forum.Potentially, this could be the last post from the members who are part of this initial experiment. We have forged bonds that we know will always be there among us. We thank you immensely once again for this opportunity.Regards,@gene@Axel_T@Juanbug_PGov@Oxytocin@juankbell@teresacd","The Optimism Collective's Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) Season 5 retrospective highlights successful progress towards reducing governance overhead and decentralizing dispute resolution.  The CoCC effectively managed conflicts, improving community relations and reducing the burden on the Foundation.  Key achievements include decreased Token House voting and improved communication.  Future improvements include community outreach to identify conflicts early, simplifying internal operating procedures, expanding the scope to address social fabric issues, and potentially using external Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) for complex cases.  The CoCC recommends continued operation in Season 6, potentially incorporating ADR to handle a wider range of disputes efficiently.

Elected  Representatives üíº,Code of Conduct Council Communication Thread,https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-communication-thread/7453,"Voting Cycle#17- Summary of Enforcement DecisionsHello Optimists,As per the Code of Conduct Councilcharter, the Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) must publish a report of summary of enforcement actions during each voting cycle‚Äôs review period. This report in turn ‚Äúwill be added to the Voting Roundup and optimistically approved. In this context, optimistic approval means the Council‚Äôs decisions are assumed to be approved unless the Token House explicitly vetos an enforcement action.‚ÄùSo, taking this charter structure on board, this Forum Thread will act as the formal Report to summarize the enforcement actions of Voting Cycle#17, and begin a conversation with any interested members in the community here.To provide context for this cycle‚Äôs deliberations:There were no new Code of Conduct Violation Reports from the start of the new year, and through the first two weeks of Season 5.There were however three (3) legacy Code of Conduct Violation Reports that had been submitted at the latter end of 2023 that had not been handled by the Foundation (since the new Code of Conduct Council was pending at the time).Thus the CoCC was tasked with assessing, deliberating, and deciding on three (3) reports that claimed a code of conduct violation.The process is taken by the CoCC Members:All members of the CoCC were provided with raw details of the three legacy violation reports at the end of 2023.Over the new year break, individual CoCC members conducted preliminary research into the three cases.In the 2nd week of January, the CoCC met to discuss the main issues of the three cases (along with having discussions around administrative matters of the newly formed council).Post this meeting, the reports and report summaries were transferred to a shared online document where over the following week each individual CoCC member added their thoughts, opinions, and reasoning on each case to the shared document. The shared document was indeed a living document as each member‚Äôs opinion or thought led to the next member‚Äôs response.On January 16th, a final vote was taken by members of the council to finalize a decision on each of the cases. The voting was conducted electronically, with a variety of alternate actions to choose from, and a ‚Äòfirst past the post‚Äô voting system was used.NOTE: While all the processes mentioned above appear as discrete events, it‚Äôs worth noting that the council members have been in discussions on an almost daily basis since late November 2023 via a private CoCC Telegram group.None of the three cases had unanimous voting decisions, but using the voting system mentioned just prior, three resolutions were decided upon.The briefcase summaries are decisions are described below:REPORT 1:An anonymous complaint was made against@alexcutlerdotethWhile there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement in December 2023, the complainant claimed that Alex had cyberbullied community members, harassed community members, and incited others to harass them.Decision: No action to takeReasoning: The Code of Conduct Council has decided not to proceed with any sort of enforcement type related to the presented report. It has been reviewed along with the supporting documentation and has concluded this matter will not be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct, as the information presented only contains factual details of an alleged grant misusage, and is then considered whistleblowing. Whistleblowing is not considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.*Parties involved in this case should please see ‚Äòimportant notes‚Äô belowREPORT 2:An anonymous complaint was made against@0xWeston.While there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement in December 2023, the complainant claimed that Weston harassed community members, did not have a positive impact through adding value, and failed to keep the community safe.Decision: Warning (with a request to make a redeeming public apology or clarification of allegations)Reasoning: With substantial documentation to support the violation report there was a prima facie case that Weston had misused or heavily mismanaged a grant provided by Optimism. However, considering the timing of the grant and the lack of formal grant rules around this period, the CoCC found it inappropriate to issue a stronger enforcement action when it would need to be applied retroactively. Therefore, a warning from Optimism to Weston was the agreed-upon decision. Beyond this, and in the interests of inclusivity, redemption, and self-directed decentralized activities, the CoCC invites Weston to address the community on the Forum to either apologize for the poor behavior and/or otherwise acknowledge the weaknesses of the grant management while fully explaining and clarifying what happened in this case.*Parties involved in this case should please see ‚Äòimportant notes‚Äô belowREPORT 3:An anonymous complaint was made against kuso.eth.While there was a rescoping of the Code of Conduct and the Rules of Engagement in December 2023, the complainant claimed kudo.eth engaged in discrimination based on identifying features, such as religion, sexuality, ethnicity, or geographical location.Decision: SuspensionReasoning: The CoCC believed that the reported violation was a clear and unambiguously serious violation of the Rules of Engagement and that any enforcement needed to convey the clear boundaries of what are the acceptable and not acceptable interactions within this human-driven community. While on-chain activities cannot be controlled by the CoCC or the Collective at large, a suspension from all of Optimism‚Äôs online platforms hopes to communicate how seriously the CoCC took this issue and how unequivocally it wanted to act.NOTES FOR THE COMMUNITY:This Code of Conduct Council is a new type of live experiment that the current council members are carrying out. We‚Äôve had our teething problems, and we are the first to admit that the structures and processes do not yet meet the highest standards that each of the council members envisioned when first elected. But we can assure the community that we are doing our best to learn fast and iterate, to be open, available, and transparent with the community and all other stakeholders, and we aim to continually improve over Season 5 so we can hand over a well structured and highly functioning Code of Conduct Council to the council members of Season 6.IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PARTIES INVOLVED IN THESE CASES:A member of our council said something important in relation to these first three decisions, ‚Äú(The CoCC is) setting a precedent for what the CoCC is. How we can be fast with things that are clearly violations of the rules, and careful with breaches in the social fabric? How also instead of a punitive council, we are restoring optimism from its own contributors.‚ÄùThis statement was quickly agreed upon by other members of the council.What is trying to be said here is that Reports 1 and 2 appear to be cases that relate more to a breach in the social fabric of Optimism, and importantly we do NOT want to be a punitive council but instead one that inspires and engenders optimism.And, thus in that vein, we don‚Äôt necessarily want to ‚Äòclose the books‚Äô on the dispute(s) here, and just wash our hands of it. Instead, we would like to offer any of the disaffected parties here an opportunity to reach out and contact the Code of Conduct Council if you wish to discuss your situation further. The Council currently has members who are experts in conflict resolution, mediation, alternative dispute resolution, and DAO coordination. We would like to use these skills and experience to offer you a more optimal outcome, beyond the cut & dry of the Code of Conduct Council decisions. We‚Äôre happy to work with you to find the outcome to the complaint you want or ideally find happiness and satisfaction in the situation that you thought the hoped outcome would bring. So, please, if you are still unsatisfied then please reach out to us atcodeofconduct@optimism.ioWhile there will be upcoming office hours, and discussions with the CoCC here on the Forum and on Discord, our next formal report of enforcement decisions will be delivered by the end of the next review period.As the implementation of the Council is an ongoing experiment, each of us is committed to making every effort to modify and improve as deemed necessary. We will accept any critique or criticism of our process thus far and will work to amend our process to reflect our learnings.Thank you for your time,Members of the Code of Conduct Council","The Optimism Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) reviewed three legacy Code of Conduct violation reports from late 2023.  One report, against @alexcutlerdoteth, alleging cyberbullying, resulted in no action; the CoCC deemed it whistleblowing, not a violation. A report against @0xWeston, concerning grant mismanagement, resulted in a warning and a request for a public apology.  Finally, a report against kuso.eth for discriminatory behavior led to a suspension from Optimism platforms.  The CoCC acknowledged its processes are evolving and offered further mediation to dissatisfied parties.  Future improvements and transparency are planned.

Other sections of the Code of Conduct fall under the responsibility of other councils of the collective, such as the Grants council.Deliberation of sanctions (temp ban, permanent ban)Process documented, privacy preservedOutcome published to the forumCOCC conflict management steps and times1. Identification: communication phase. Estimated time, up to 5 working days.It shouldn‚Äôt take longer than a week after a triggering fact, for the CoCC to inform the parties that a case has opened and that cooperation will be requested to advance on the next steps of the process.Were the informed party not reply within 5 working days after being reached out by the Code of Conduct Council, the Council will decide unilaterally the course of action to be taken and whether to advance to the Screening stage.No member of the board will seek to react directly to any conflict, but rather to gather the opinions of other members in order to define the next steps.2. Screening: Gathering of information. Estimated time, up to 5 working days.After a case is identified, If the violation is clear and manifest, the council can deliberate without further mapping. If the issue requires to raise more information to make an informed decision, the council will be able to decide if the following week can be a deliberation week, if the case pivots to the mediation provider, if they are ready for voting on the next steps of the case, or if it‚Äôs considered to extend the screening process up to 10 additional working days.In the event that a member commits a severe violation and immediate action is required, the COCC will suspend the member from the spaces while the screening process is complete.The COCC will maintain constant contact with the suspended member to maintain a flow of information.3. Deliberation: Estimate time, up to 5 working days.Once the screening phase is complete, an informed decision is made by consent or by simple vote in the council. This decision contains next steps on the case, including if, and what sanction applies.A decision can be made by consent when there is no objection (i.e., a warning that the decision could pose a danger to the collective) from the members.4. Follow up: 3 month period (half a season)Since the CoCC is a persistent structure in Optimism governance starting in season 6, If this follow up period happens between seasons, the previous CoCC members would have to handoff the issues and share the registry of cases to the new council, considering that members may change.After the deliberation phase, follow up is where we will review if the proposed actions were effective to deal with the situation, by having accountability on the parties responsibilities. If during the follow up period, new information arises, reconsideration can be made by the council, returning to the screening phase, for a new deliberation on the case.Definition of warnings:A warning is a response to inappropriate behavior that has the intention to prevent scaling of conflicts. Warnings play a pedagogic and corrective role in an incremental structure of graduated sanctions.As stated in the Rules of Engagement,Rules of Engagement 2.0EnforceabilityIf possible, on a case-by-case scenario, Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms may be recommended.If you do not abide by the rules above, you will receive a warning. After two warnings, you may receive a suspension for 1 month. After that, you may receive a 3 month suspension. If you continue to violate the above rules, you may be permanently removed from all Optimism community spaces. Any violation that rises to the level of those discussed in the Guidance on Severe Violations will immediately result in a one month suspension.Additional considerationsRegistry of cases will be handled privately between the CoCC and the foundation.These Internal operating procedures can be updated twice per season after being published in the forum.Mid and season reports are expected with analysis of patterns on conflicting cases and self evaluation of the council for transparency.","The Optimism Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) manages disputes within the Optimism Collective.  Members, elected by the community, address violations of the rules of engagement.  Reporting can be anonymous.  Cases are categorized as small, medium, or large, with escalating responses from de-escalation and mediation to temporary or permanent bans.  A four-stage process (identification, screening, deliberation, follow-up) is employed, with timelines and documentation.  Warnings are used incrementally before suspensions.  The CoCC maintains a private case registry and reports bi-seasonally on performance.

As stated in theCharter:Communication and coordination among the participants;Secure key management;Verifying and promptly enacting Optimism Governance-approved upgrades and permission changes;Notifying the other participants of, and collaborating in good faith to promptly resolve, defined emergency situations; andProving continued access to keys via periodic liveness checks, where participants must prove they can access their keys within a set time limit.Members will be supported by OP stipends, pending Operating Budget submission by the Council Lead and approval by the Token House. Operating expenses will be reimbursed by the Foundation.The Security Council legal agreement also covers participants against certain liabilities.For security purposes, details of these procedures should remain private among the Council.Lead ResponsibilitiesAs stated in theCharter, the Council Lead, meanwhile, is responsible for supporting the implementation and operationalization of the aforementioned procedures, including by:Alerting key holders of upcoming protocol upgrade or role permissioning proposals going through Governance;Managing required timelines;Scheduling, setting agendas, and hosting Council meetings and facilitating discussions;Monitoring compliance with the procedures;Onboarding new Council participants; andCommunicating with external stakeholders, including Optimism Governance, as to Council operations. All Security Council participants are expected to perform these responsibilities with the awareness that OP Chains, the OP Stack, the developing Superchain, and the associated products, tools, and documentation are in a rapidly evolving nascent state. To the extent that unforeseeable circumstances or ambiguities arise (including in connection with potential responses to Exception Events), the participants will work in good faith to resolve them consistent with theCharterand theLaw of Chains.In line with standard Council processes, the Lead will submit an Operating Budget to the Token House to request OP stipends from the Governance Fund.Note:  the Council Lead is not a key holder.Finally, all Security Council participants are all subject to removal via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in theOperating Manual.Nomination ProcessAnyone meeting the eligibility criteria outlined below may self-nominate to join Cohort A (including existing members) by completing the requirednomination templateand posting to thenomination threadby August 14th at 19:00 GMT.8 delegate approvalsfrom the top 100 delegates will be required by August 19th at 19:00 GMT for any nomination to move to a vote. There is no limit to the number of terms a Security Council participant may serve.Top 100 delegates may provide approval by pasting the below language as a comment under a candidate‚Äôs nomination:‚ÄùI am an Optimism delegate [link to yourdelegate commitment] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.""Eligibility ConsiderationsParticipants on the Security Council may be either individuals or entities.Entity requirements:Active and offers a service that benefits the blockchain communityOperating for at least one year with sufficient runway to continue for at least one yearAll participants on the Security Council, whether individuals or entities, should be selected in accordance with the following criteria:Reputation.Known, trusted individuals or entities that have demonstrated consistent alignment with the Optimistic Vision.Technical competency.Baseline proficiency with the OP Stack and secure key management and signing standards.Additionally, candidates may be asked to sign into the OP Atlas app, connect GitHub, verify their wallet and calculate an expertise score. There is no minimum requirement for an expertise score, but it can serve as an indicator to help delegates evaluate a candidate‚Äôs technical expertise.Alignment.Participants should not possess conflicts of interest that will regularly impact their ability to make impartial decisions in the performance of their role. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Optimism competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects or self-dealing, etc. There should be no more than 3 members serving on other Security Councils.Ability to participate.A candidate‚Äôs willingness and ability to actively participate and fulfil the member responsibilities, dedicating an average of approximately 5 active hours per month hours per month, should be considered. Please note that there is an ‚Äúon-call‚Äù aspect to this role that is not fully encompassed in the active hours estimate.Geographic diversity.The number of participants that reside in any country should be less than the quorum required for multisig action.  The Foundation is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If a new member would surpass the threshold of signers from any one country, the next qualifying runner up will fill their place.Diversity of interests.No more than 1 elected member is associated with a particular entity, or that entity‚Äôs employees or affiliates. The Foundation is responsible for ensuring this criteria is met. If multiple members from the same entity are elected, the next qualifying runner up will fill the place of any duplicate positions held by the same entity.The Optimism Foundation may appoint nominees after the self-nomination deadline, or take such other administrative steps as necessary or appropriate, if there are fewer than 7 eligible member nominees and 1 Lead nominee.As with other Councils, the Foundation will facilitate a town hall to help delegates assess candidates. The town hall will take place Tuesday, August 20th at 2pm EST / 6pm GMT.ElectionsElections will run from August 22nd - 28th at 19:00 GMT. Elections use approval voting. Approval voting is set up such that delegates can place a vote for any number of nominees with their full voting power. In the case of approval/ranked choice votes, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions.Once elected, all participants will be required to pass an eligibility screening process before being added to the Council. This process may include KYC/AML and sanctions screening, and a requirement that the member sign a standard contract, which will be implemented at the discretion of the Optimism Foundation. If a candidate fails the screen after being elected, the next qualified runner up to pass the screening may take their place.Newly elected members that pass the Foundation‚Äôs screen will begin their 12 month term on February 9th.Removal of Council membersAll members are subject to removal via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual. A valid Representative Removal proposal related to a Security Council member must be posted to the forum and must receive 8 delegate approvals (which is higher than the default for this proposal type) to initiate a Token House vote in the next nearest voting cycle (a delay of 3 weeks maximum).The Security Council or Foundation can also act unilaterally to remove a participant who fails to satisfy the requirements of the Charter if such failure falls within the defined scope of emergency powers.In either of the above removal scenarios, an election for a removed member‚Äôs replacement should occur in the same, or next nearest, voting cycle as the removal. The Foundation will maintain a shortlist of strong candidates that are interested in joining the Council and could be nominated quickly, subject to the eligibility requirements, if need be.There is no emergency replacement procedure as the required signing threshold is automatically lowered in the case a liveness check or emergency removal by the Security Council or Foundation.Key Dates for Candidates- Now through August 14th at 19:00 GMT:Post your nomination to thisthreadusing thistemplate- Before August 19th at 19:00 GMT:Nominations must receive 8 Top 100 delegate approvals to be considered valid- Tuesday, August 20th at 2pm EST / 6pm GMT:Approved candidates should join the town hall- August 22nd - August 28th:Security Council Cohort A Lead elections take place atvote.optimism.io-August 26th - September 1st:Security Council Cohort A Member elections take place atvote.optimism.io- In the meantime:Candidates must pass Foundation screening and complete rehearsals- February:12 month term begins for the new Cohort A!","The Optimism Security Council (OSC) is holding elections for Cohort A, starting August 14th.

Before that,Unipigwas one of the earliest proof of concepts in Ethereum application scaling.Uniswap is one of the most used applications across all Superchain L2s (here) as well as the most popular DEX on Optimism with 60%+ market share (here).In addition to the scale and positive impact of Uniswap stemming from our deployment on multiple Superchain L2s, the Uniswap Foundation (‚ÄùUF‚Äù), along with many Uniswap community members, have made additional positive contributions to the community, including:With the OP Grant to Uniswap early 2023, the UF alongside Uniswap community members were able to successfully deploy 3 Liquidity Mining campaigns for relatively sticky liquidity on major OP pools working with delegates from both the Optimism and Uniswap governance communities.The work done by Uniswap community members, Uniswap Labs, and Across onERC-7683focuses on establishing standards for crosschain intent fulfillment, which greatly reduces the interop friction for any dapp users needing users to bridge assets or fill transactions across chains.The UF recently co-sponsored a proposal with Whetstone Research to introduce new fee tiers on Base in order to provide more competitive pricing to swappers (here). If successful, the insights gathered will be informative and we may expand these fee tiers to other Superchain L2s.Please demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:Our team has helped to grow the Uniswap governance community over the past two years, building strong working relationships with a large number of delegates from a wide range of organizations, recently hosting 40 delegates at a governance-specific workshop called Govswap the day before EthCC in Brussels. Working with these members of the community, we have seen the UF‚Äôs participation as a major stakeholder in Uniswap governance proposals (delegating votes to post a proposal or posting it ourselves) drop from ~60% in 2023 to ~25% so far in 2024.  We have an acute appreciation for the human and technical intricacies of various governance processes, and will act as good stewards in this role‚Äôs ‚Äúoracle‚Äù responsibilities.Elsewhere, we have recently taken a more active role in developing and auditing smart contracts for use by the Uniswap ecosystem, including Uniswap v4, where a team member is a leading contributor to theperiphery repoand is intimately involved in the audit process, and Unistaker, where we managed mechanism design, contract development, and the security audit process.Please elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle (this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to your nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):Chirag Narangwas most recently VP of Product at Dapper Labs, where he was responsible for Flow‚Äôs strategic direction and execution across core protocol, smart contract language, and developer experience, managing a team of 50 Engineers and 6 PMs.Erin Koenspent two years (2020-2022) as a full-stack engineer at Avantgarde Finance, working on the Enzyme asset management app and its supporting infrastructure.

We regularly coordinate between members of not only the Uniswap Protocol ecosystem but also across other DeFi and chain ecosystems. We have also helped to manage the execution and implementation of technical projects including smart contract and app development, security audits, and governance votes. We maintain close working relationships with stakeholders of all stripes and pride ourselves on being thorough and responsive.Further, we have managed the creation and execution of numerous onchain votes for the Uniswap Protocol since our founding two years ago and stay informed regarding those votes in which we are not principal participants. This experience can easily translate into prompt, safe execution of Optimism Governance-approved actions.Finally, our team manages onchain accounts to administer our UNI treasury as well as a portion of our grants budget. The signers on those accounts have developed and maintained protocols for transaction hygiene as well as key management.Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:Coming from the Uniswap ecosystem, we understand that security is paramount to the longterm success of protocols. Often times security only becomes a focus after a crisis, but we believe that best practices for proactive security is how we maintain operational excellence as Council members. This is manifested in Uniswap through consistent audits and reviews to help establish frameworks for best understanding risks as we did with theCrosschain Bridge Assessment report.While we can do everything to protect against security risks, unfortunately we must also plan for worst case scenarios. This involves war rooming at any hour, constant and transparent communications, as well as the technical competency to participate in recovery. Although we have been fortunate as a protocol, it comes with hard work behind the scenes and working with trusted partners across the ecosystem.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,[FINAL] Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage Enforcement,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-proposal-to-reclassify-grant-misusage-enforcement/7384,"Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage EnforcementAfter discussions with the elected Token House Code of Conduct Council and the Grants Council, the Foundation would like to propose a change to two proposal types pertaining to grant misusage. The goal of these changes is to eliminate delegate responsibility for grant misusage enforcement. This is based on strong feedback from delegates that they do not wish to vote on enforcement actions and the establishment of an experimental Token House Code of Conduct Council, which could instead process grant misusage reports as representatives of the Token House.Currently, Collective grants may be clawed back for failure to meet critical milestones. The Grant Clawback is a proposal type, outlined in theOperating Manual, that currently requires a full Token House vote. Based on delegate feedback that delegates do not want to vote on Code of Conduct matters, this proposal would remove the Grant Clawback proposal type from theOperating Manualand re-classify Grant Clawback as an enforcement option under theGrant Policies(which are processed under the Code of Conduct, by the Token House Code of Conduct Council.)Currently, the Token House may implement a Future Grant Freeze against grant recipients that have violated theGrant Policies, enforceable via theCode of Conduct. We propose removing Future Grant Freeze as an enforcement action approved by the full Token House and replacing it with theGrant Misusage Process. This process outlines a clear protocol for the objective reporting and verification of grant misusage, to be documented in a public database that can be referenced by anyone when making future grant decisions. We believe this is a governance-minimized way to maintain accountability for grant recipients without requiring Token House delegates to be involved in enforcement decisions.This proposal is put forward by the Foundation and, therefore, does not require delegate approvals. This proposal will move to a vote in Voting Cycle#17.",Summary not available
Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Upgrade Proposal #11: Holocene Network Upgrade,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-11-holocene-network-upgrade/9313,"Proposal Title:Holocene governance proposalProposal Type: Protocol UpgradeExecutive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Dragan, a technical program manager at OP labs working on the OP blockchain development team, and a core contributor of the OP Stack. I reviewed this proposal in collaboration with Sebastian Stammler, Adrian Sutton, George Knee, Matt Solomon from the OP labs team and with Roberto Bayardo from the Base team.Neither OP labs nor I represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.Holocene contains three changes:Holocene block derivation: a set of changes that render the derivation pipeline stricter and simpler, but also improve worst-case scenarios for Fault Proofs and Interoperability.EIP-1559 configurability: The elasticity and denominator EIP-1559 parameters become configurable via theSystemConfigL1 contract, allowing gas target and gas limit to be independently configured.MIPS contract upgrade: Updates to support additional calls made by the newop-programversion.Motivation:We are submitting this proposal to make our community aware about all the improvement we made to our derivation pipeline and adding EIP-1559 configurability options.I believe we should adopt the listed changes since we are getting a lot of improvements to the current codebase with this upgrade.Also the listed changes are opening the doors for future Fault proofs and Interoperability project, since they both need improvement to our block derivation.Specifications:Blockspace Charter:This Protocol Upgrade is scoped to theStandard Rollup Charter.Corresponding changes are specified in this PR:Holocene Standard Rollup CharterTechnical Specification:The Holocene network upgrade (spec overview) activates the following features:Holocene derivation(Holocene L2 Chain Derivation) comprises the following changes to the derivation process:Strict Batch Orderingrequires batches within and across channels to be strictly ordered.Partial Span Batch Validitydetermines the validity of singular batches from a span batch individually, only invalidating the remaining span batch upon the first invalid singular batch.Fast Channel Invalidation, similar to Partial Span Batch Validity applied to the channel layer, forward-invalidates a channel upon finding an invalid batch.Steady Block Derivationderives invalid payload attributes immediately as deposit-only blocks.EIP-1559 configurability(Dynamic EIP-1559 Parameters) allows configuring the elasticity and denominator EIP-1559 parameters via the L1 SystemConfig. A new config update event was added, which is parsed by CL clients and then inserted into the extra field of the payload attributes in a special encoding format. These parameters, in turn, are then read by the EL clients during block building and applied accordingly. Aswithother SystemConfig updates, setting this is restricted to the SystemConfig owner.Simplified Fee Scalar Configurationwith new methods in theSystemConfig- this allows chain operators to change fee scalars in a more direct way, reducing the chance of user errorsSecurity ConsiderationsConsistent withOP labs audit frameworkwe did not have the contents of Holocene audited; however, Coinbase and OP Labs engineers did perform asecurity review(Failure Mode Analysis) of these changes. The linked FMA can be consulted for details.As for any hardfork that changes derivation, there is a risk that either the spec itself has a bug or that any implementation has a bug.We‚Äôve mitigated these risks by thorough internal reviews of the spec and unit and end-to-end tests of the implementations in Go and Rust.Also, we have added differential tests of the derivation changes between the Go and Rust fault-proof program implementations op-program and Kona for the first time.Holocene has also already been activated on internal devnets of Base and OP Labs, and it was confirmed that these networks operate as expected and that the new EIP1559 reconfigurability works as intended.Specific security considerations for the Holocene upgrade are discussed in therespective section of the Holocene derivation spec. A noteworthy change in Holocene derivation behavior is that invalid payload attributes got second chances to replace valid, future payload attributes.Because they are immediately replaced by deposit-only attributes with Holocene, there is a theoretically heightened risk for unsafe chain reorgs; however, it is only if a buggy or malicious sequencer batches an invalid block. To the best of our knowledge, we haven‚Äôt experienced this on OP Mainnet or other mainnet OP Stack chains yet.Such a scenario would still be automatically resolved: the batcher would detect the reorg and submit the reorged unsafe section of the chain.With the stricter derivation rules, some complexity gets shifted from the derivation pipeline to the batcher because it now has to adhere to stricter rules in order not to produce invalid channels or batches.We‚Äôve implemented a set of improvements to the batcher to guarantee the stricter ordering rules by design. Next to that, the Holocene contains the fail-safe rule that any first frame of a new channel replaces old buffered frames of non-completed channels. An invalid batch forwards-invalidates any remaining batches and the channel that contained the batch.This means that an emergency batcher restart should be able to resolve any deadlock in the derivation pipeline if it were to occur.Impact SummaryWe do not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.Bringing Holocene derivation changes is making our derivation pipeline stricter and simpler.It also allow us to improve and unlock new development paths for Fault Proofs and Interoperability features.EIP-1559 configurability allows chain operators to change the gas target independently from the gas limit. Before, a workaround had to be taken to raise the limit to indirectly raise the target, and then enforce the old limit via a sequencer block building policy.Precommitment impact review:This Upgrade Proposal does not impact any of the precommitments in the Standard Rollup Charter.Collective Fee Take: no modification or onchain implementation introduced.Governor/Servicer Role Separation: no change to role structures or authorization patterns.Ossified GasLimits: this upgrade does make it easier to configure Gas Limits, but does not ossify them.Direct Fee Margin Controls: no change to the relevant configuration structure and authorization. Some helper methods for get/set logic are added to the SystemConfig, but do not fulfill the overall intent of this precommittment.Action Plan for this releaseIf this vote passes, the Holocene upgrade will be planned for execution on the9th of Jan 2025 18:00:01 UTC.The upgrade will occur automatically for chains on the Granite mainnet release if those chains have opted-in to activate at Superchain times via their superchain-registry configuration (i.e., have thesuperchain_timeset to a timestamp before or at the mainnet activation time, or have set theirholocene_timedirectly). The mainnet release will be prepared at a later time during the governance process, but no later than 4 weeks before the proposed activation time.Holocene is code complete in the optimism monorepo at a tagop-node/v1.10.2-rc.1and op-geth at tagop-geth/v1.101411.4-rc.2.Contract updatesThe following contracts are updated to OP Contractsv1.8.0-rc.3 release:MIPS: 1.2.1FaultDisputeGame: 1.3.1PermissionedDisputeGame: 1.3.1SystemConfig: 2.3.0SystemConfig UpdateTheSystemConfigL1 contract will get upgraded to version 2.3.0  (the implementation is deployed at this address:(‚Äú0xAB9d6cB7A427c0765163A7f45BB91cAfe5f2D375‚Äù).This is a shared implementation of the Mainnet SuperchainThe upgrade will happen after the Holocene activation.

This transaction has to be executedbeforethe actual Holocene activation to avoid a broken Fault Proofs system after the activation.Updates to the MIPS contractAs part of the Holocene upgrade, the Go compiler was updated from 1.21 to 1.22. This impacts the op-program as the go1.22 runtime makes additional syscalls that are not supported by the pre-Holocene MIPS Fault Proof Virtual Machine (FPVM).As such, Holocene includes an update to MIPS.sol that supports go1.22 programs. This change to the FPVM is very minimal; an update to thefcntlsyscall emulation that was partially implemented by the pre-Holocene FPVM. In order to make sure we implemented this in a proper way, we conducted an external audit for this change. In order to make sure we implemented this in a proper way, we conducted an external audit for this change, which is open for reviews under thislink- no major findings reported.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the network upgrade after Granite titled Holocene.

Whereas today, proposals on Optimism are voted onchain, but executed manually by the Optimism Foundation according to the outcome of the vote, this upgrade will make it such that for OP token transfer proposals are executed fully onchain, automatically, and without relying on the Foundation.Note that for non-treasury token transfer proposals (such as protocol and governance upgrades) execution will continue to be conducted the by OP Foundation as before.As part of this update, we‚Äôre also introducing minor patches that address findings from aprevious audit.If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to the new implementation specified below.MotivationOnchain Execution of treasury transfers moves us along the path towards progressive decentralization, in line with the strategy outlined in theWorking Constitutionand theLong-term Onchain Governance Architecture.With this proposal, we‚Äôre incredibly excited to take the first of a series of steps towards decentralization.SpecificationsContract ChangedOptimism governorTheOptimism Governorwould be changed as part of this upgrade.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Season 6: Standard Rollup Charter Ratification,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-standard-rollup-charter-ratification/8135,"Season 6: Standard Rollup Charter// This draft will be ratified by the Token House in Voting Cycle#29. For more context on the Blockspace Charter Framework, seehere.IntroductionThe Standard Rollup is the Optimism Collective‚Äôs flagship, high-security blockspace product. The Standard Rollup targets the Collective‚Äôs highest bar for security, uptime, and decentralization.This Charter applies the principles of theLaw of Chainsto the specific context of Standard Rollups, and does not modify or supersede the Law of Chains in any way.  All conflicts between this Charter and the provisions of Law of Chains will be resolved in favor of the Law of Chains.Optimism Governance is responsible for upholding the standards and policies outlined in this Charter and ensuring their consistency with the Law of Chains.  All potential changes to the Standard Rollup should be treated with careful consideration by the governance community, to enable long-term, sustainable ecosystems to be built around Standard Rollup blockspace with confidence.CriteriaThe criteria for being a Standard Rollup consist of:A set of deterministiconchain criteriato ensure that chains are well-configured, on an up-to-date version, and have authorized the Optimism Security Council to perform upgrades.A set of lightweight,offchain criteriachecked by the Optimism Foundation, which are expected to carry on until they are ready to be safely transitioned to Optimism Governance.Completion of a ‚Äúhistory integrity check‚Äù by the Optimism Foundation, which is expected to be deprecated in the future (as chains deploy directly as Standard Rollups from day 1).Onchain CriteriaThe onchain criteria for Standard Rollups consist of two components: aversion checkand aconfiguration check.Version ValidationThe most important onchain criteria is that a chain be on a standard, governance-approved release of the OP Stack. This check is performed by comparing all bytecode for the chain‚Äôs L1 smart contracts to the standard bytecode corresponding to a governance-approved release of the OP Stack.Version validation is a strict, critical requirement. To securely hand over upgradability to the Collective, a chain‚Äôs L1 smart contracts must match the release tags defined bythis TOML filein the Superchain Registry. At the time of writing, this corresponds toop-contracts@v1.6.0.For those interested, the code currently used in the Superchain Registry to perform version (and configuration) checks can be foundhere. The Optimism Foundation may, from time to time, update this code (e.g. for quality-of-life improvements or other refactors),so long as it does not violate the semantic interpretation of the above TOML files, which are subject to Governance approval.Configuration CheckBeyond being on a standard version of the OP Stack, all configuration values for the chain must be within high-security, well-tested bounds, and all administrative roles must be  set correctly. There are two main components:Parameter Configuration: A set of requirements for the ‚Äúprotocol parameters‚Äù of a chain ‚Äî things like block time, gas metering, and other low-level variables ‚Äî to either equal a certain value, or fall within a specified range. The specific requirements can be foundhere.Role Configuration: A set of requirements for the privileged administrative roles for the chain. The specific requirements can be foundhere. Primarily, these checks involve ensuring that the Security Council holds authorization to perform upgrades, and other minor Stage 1 requirements (seehere).A more human-readable breakdown of these requirements, including supporting rationale choices, can be found in theconfigurability pageof the OP Stack docs. However, the ultimate source of truth for configuration requirements are the two TOML files linked above, as modified from time to time by Optimism Governance.The Optimism Foundation may, from time to time, update thevalidation codeused in the Superchain Registry to perform these checks,so long as it does not violate the semantic interpretation of the above TOML files, which are subject to Governance approval.Role Configuration ExceptionsCertain chains‚ÄôL1ProxyAdminrole shall satisfy the Standard Rollup Criteria, without the default address0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A, so long as that role is a 3/3 gnosis SAFE between the Chain Governor, Optimism Foundation, and Security Council. These chains are:BaseUnichainThese Chain Governors have publicly committed to using their upgrade key consistent with the ‚ÄúNormal Operation‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmergency Response‚Äù sections of the Security Council Charter.While not currently anticipated, the Optimism Foundation may propose expansions of this list from time to time, subject to governance approval via the Protocol Upgrade process.Offchain CriteriaIn addition to the above deterministic criteria, the Optimism Foundation may perform a limited set of manual, offchain checks at its discretion before inclusion as a Standard Rollup. These checks include:ChainID check: ensuring that the Chain ID is unique and does not collide with a pre-existing EVM chain.Gas Limit check: ensuring that the Chain‚Äôs initial GasLimit is configured to a reasonable value based on the then-current status of OP Stack performance testing. (See below for additional context on Gas Limit policy.)Security Monitoring: ensuring certain standard monitoring tools have been deployed for every chain.Governor/Servicer verification: verifying at the social layer that the chain is indeed deployed and operated by the parties in question, and are not being impersonated.Other checks: running other checks (e.g. compliance-related checks) as deemed appropriate.Given the fundamentally subjective nature of these checks, they are expected to be administered by the Foundation until they can be safely transitioned to Governance.History Integrity ChecksThe Optimism Foundation has implemented a suite of history integrity checks, which can be used to identify historical discrepancies between chains and manually assess their impact. The Optimism Foundation will assess these discrepancies on an as-needed basis. If it believes that these discrepancies risk violating the Law of Chains (e.g., User Protections) in the future once the chain is added as a Standard Rollup, it will deny the chain‚Äôs inclusion, even if all other criteria in this document are met.The importance of history integrity checks should quickly diminish over time towards deprecation, since the expectation is that all Standard Rollups launched after the ratification of this Charter are deployed correctly at launch.For more information on the motivation for history integrity checks, seethis post.Note on Superchain RegistryThe ""promotion‚Äù of a chain (i.e. setting itssuperchain_levelto1) in thesuperchain-registryrepo will be the canonical indicator of passing the offchain criteria and history integrity checks. Thus, the community can determine whether a given chain falls under the scope of this Charter by checking that:The Chain passes all Onchain Criteria checksThe Chain has been included by the Foundation in thesuperchain-registryrepo.Even after history integrity checks are deprecated, it should be expected that the Foundation‚Äôs subjective checks are also either eliminated, or transitioned to a process run directly by the community, so that inclusion may be determined purely by onchain data.Governing PoliciesThe Standard Rollup‚Äôs governing policies implement additional ‚Äúreactive‚Äù procedures in the event that one or more stakeholder protections in the Law of Chains are violated in such a way that the protocol cannot naturally handle them. Each of these governing policies include reference to a specific protection in the Law of Chains.As such, these governing policies are applications of the existing principles of the Law of Chains. Subject to the provisions of the Law of Chains, these policies are intended to establish predictable enforcement paths for an illustrative (but not exhaustive) list of potential violations of that document.In its current form, all governing policies‚Äô relevant enforcement actions would be taken by theL1ProxyAdminrole, which is held by the Phase 0 Security Council, a 2/2 shared by the Foundation and the Optimism Governance-approved Council (or in the case of the chains listed in ‚ÄúOnchain Criteria‚ÄìRole Configuration Exceptions‚Äù above, a 3/3 with the Phase 0 Council plus the Chain Governor). As such, all enforcement actions are expected to follow the standard Protocol Upgrade vote procedure, which is the existing path used for governance to exercise theL1ProxyAdminrole. In the future, policies may include different enforcement mechanisms (e.g. via unilateral action by other councils, or via direct onchain governor outcomes given explicit authority in the protocol.)Governor Key RecoveryIn the current version of the OP Stack, theSystemConfigOwneris permitted to change certain chain configuration values. According to the Law of Chains, control of some of these values are afforded to the Chain Governor (e.g. transaction fee margin), and others are afforded to the Chain Servicer (e.g. the batcher hotkey).For convenience, the Configuration Check in the above criteria permits either the Chain Servicer or the Chain Governor to be theSystemConfigOwner, so that Chain Governors can delegate all configuration updates to Servicers. However, because the Chain Governor is also protected by the Law of Chains tobe able to switch between Chain Servicers, ultimate control of theSystemConfigOwnerrole should belong to the Chain Governor.In the event that a Chain Servicer stops fulfilling the wishes of the Chain Governor for those values which the Law of Chains states they should be able to control, or refuses to transfer control of theSystemConfigOwnerrole in the event that the Chain Governor desires to switch to a different servicer, then the Chain Governor may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to have the Security Council recover the role to an account they control.Sequencer CensorshipIn the event that a sequencer is determined to be maliciously censoring valid user transactions, or experiencing unreasonable downtime impacting applications on the chain, they are violating the User Protection ofSecurity, Uptime, and Livenessin the Law of Chains.In the event that a Chain Governor refuses to change its sequencer in reaction (after it has clearly been put on notice of the violation), the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand appoint a new non-censoring sequencer.Responsible GasLimitsThe OP Stack is rapidly evolving and the boundaries of its performance continue to be pushed. As such, the protocol currently does not implement a hardcoded upper bound on the Gas Limit for a chain. However, this ability must be responsibly exercised to ensurefulfillment of User Protections. Thus:Before any GasLimit increase, Chain Governors should submit to the community a public load test which demonstrates stability at that limit.After any GasLimit increase, if the chain experiences a significant degradation in performance or stability, the GasLimit should promptly be lowered back to its previous value.If a Chain Governor fails to take these steps, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand lower the GasLimit.Responsible Batch SubmissionThe current version of the OP Stack allows for batches to be submitted with up to a 12 hour delay after initial reception by the sequencer (the ‚Äúsequencing window‚Äù). However, Sequencers are expected to submit at least twice as frequently (i.e. every 6 hours). This affords sufficient time to batch submit in the case of failures or downtime, fulfilling the User Protection toSecurity, Uptime, and Liveness.In the event that a Chain Governor refuses (after it has clearly been put on notice of the violation) to change its sequencer which repeatedly and intentionally violates this practice, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand appoint a new compliant sequencer.Fee MarginsThe Law of Chains affords Chain Governors the ability to set fee margins for the chain. However, setting the fee margin significantly high can be a form of economic censorship ‚Äî by making transactions prohibitively expensive to submit, the Governor couldeffectively violate the User Protection to censorship resistance.The Standard Rollup should allow a maximum fee margin of 100% (i.e., the average cost of transactions should not exceed twice the cost of batch submission). If a Chain Governor sets the fee margin in excess of this, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the Chain Governor as theSystemConfigOwnerand lower the Fee Margin.ResourceMeteringTheSystemConfigOwnerrole is currently able to modify theResourceMeteringstruct, a low-level set of values which set certain properties of L1‚ÜíL2 message rules. This is a low-level variable with no reason to be changed outside of a protocol upgrade.If aSystemConfigOwner(either Servicer or Governor) changes this value, the community may submit a vote to Optimism Governance to remove the relevant party and revert the change.PrecommitmentsThis section commits to anticipated changes (or lack thereof) for future upgrades to this Charter.  While by no means an exhaustive description of the Standard Rollup‚Äôs full future development path, the following commitments are core to the expectations of existing and future Superchain ecosystem participants.  The Collective should endeavor to do everything in its power to ensure the following commitments are actualized, understanding that non-adherence will fundamentally and irrevocably undermine the legitimacy and trustworthiness of Optimism Governance.Collective Fee TakeThis Charter specifies a fee split of the greater of 1) 2.5% of transaction fee revenue and 2) 15% of chain profit (fee revenue - L1 submission cost).It is extremely important to provide stakeholders in the Collective with a reliable economic model on which they can build sustainable long-term ecosystems. By ratifying this Blockspace Charter, the Collective is signaling its precommitment toall Standard Rollupsthat it will not modify the fee split parameters outlined above until December 31, 2029 (at the earliest).This does not preclude changes or improvements to the implementation of the fee split contracts, so long as they preserve the original economic spirit. In the event that new sources of fees (or operating costs) are introduced to the protocol, the economics should be updated with minimized impact to the existing expectations and ecosystems in the Superchain.Governor/Servicer Role SeparationSome policies above (e.g. Governor Key Recovery) arise from an overloading of theSystemConfigOwnerrole to control configurability options which the Law of Chains affords separately to Governors and Servicers. In a future upgrade (or upgrades), the Collective should transition to a model which establishes independent roles for the Governors and Servicers of Standard Rollups, allowing them to modify the configuration values afforded to them independently. This change should also remove controllability of the Resource Metering Config without a protocol upgrade.Ossified GasLimitsBecause the OP Stack‚Äôs performance is rapidly improving, the onchain GasLimit criteria is bounded above by a significantly higher value (based on the limits of fault provability) than what chains in practice require for stability. The Governing Policy above reflects the fast-paced nature of gas limits today, in which chains frequently increase their gas limits to test stability. However, as the rate of change slows, the Collective should set a more realistic upper bound, which can only be changed via upgrade.Direct Fee Margin ControlsToday, the ‚Äúfee margin‚Äù discussed in the relevant Governing Policy above is only indirectly influenceable via the control of multiple other configuration variables. In the future, the Collective should implement a protocol improvement which allows the margin to be set more directly, and which imposes a strict upper bound of 100%, to remove the ability to perform economic censorship even temporarily.",Summary not available
Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Insights into Optimism‚Äôs Chain Composition,https://gov.optimism.io/t/insights-into-optimism-s-chain-composition/9215,"Our team,ProbeLab, has recently ran an analysis on the Optimism network (OP Stack Chain ID).

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Solution to improve DAO governance process,https://gov.optimism.io/t/solution-to-improve-dao-governance-process/7272,"1. Motivation:I believe Optimism is very serious about the its Governance Process and involving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work has go into this document (Optimism Governance Process)I‚Äôm a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the implementation of Optimism‚Äôs governance process without any changes to the current setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions instead of getting lost in tech stuff.2. Problem Now:I see 3 existing problems in implementing Optimism governance process:The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance process to avoid making mistakes.The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as Discord, Forum,‚Ä¶ for each step of the process.Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its current setup and adopt a new one.3.How We Solve It:Syncvote provides a chrome extension. It works as a unified front-end for any DAO member that wants to make a proposal to Optimism. It acts like a central hub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and handle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages ‚Äì all in one interface.Why Syncvote will fit nicely into the current Optimism practice:Non-invasive, there isn‚Äôt any new platform to familiarize with, just open the extension and click ‚Äústart new proposal‚Äù to start.The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don‚Äôt need to make any changes to your current setup.It‚Äôs free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely on-chain, so until Optimism decides to write data on-chain; it won‚Äôt cost you anything.My co-founder‚Äôs created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO:Syncvote Demo4. Next Steps to Implement:To implement this transformative solution for Optimism we propose the following steps:After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the Governance Process into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.After that, Optimism will start announcing to community members on forum, announcement channels on discord and twitter‚Ä¶ that they can start using Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.In conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to smooth governance experience for Optimism community members. I would be grateful if Optimism adopts Syncvote.Thank you for reading my post. I would like to have your feedback on this topic.","Syncvote, a free Chrome extension, streamlines Optimism's governance process.  Currently, Optimism's process burdens proposers with technical details and requires navigating multiple platforms. Syncvote acts as a centralized hub, enabling proposal creation, tracking, and management within a single interface without requiring any changes to existing infrastructure.  Its non-invasive design integrates seamlessly with current platforms.  Implementation involves converting the governance process to a Syncvote-compatible format, followed by community announcements.  This straightforward solution enhances user experience and reduces administrative overhead.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Updates to the Standard Rollup Charter,https://gov.optimism.io/t/updates-to-the-standard-rollup-charter/9067,"//This post outlines the key changes made to the Standard Rollup Charter since the v0.1 draft‚Äôs introduction earlier this year. For an introductory post explaining how Blockspace Charters work, please seethis post. The updated version of the Standard Rollup Charter proposal can be foundhere.Since the Optimism Foundation introduced the first draft of the Standard Rollup Charter earlier this year, we have had the pleasure of iterating based on conversations with Chain Governors, real-world testing via theSuperchain Registry Beta, and overall feedback from the broader community. As we seek ratification of this Charter, we wanted to provide a standalone post to outline two of the key changes made since introduction, and provide more color on their motivations than would be appropriate in the charter itself.  These two changes are:Introduction of temporary control structures: the ability for a limited set of chains to be included as a signer on a 3/3 upgrade multisig for their chain. This measure aims to mitigate the risks posed by malicious Chain Governors while allowing for confident, incremental adoption of Optimism Governance.Moving history integrity checks to offchain tooling:in operating the Superchain Registry Beta, the Optimism Foundation uncovered significant operational overhead in programmatically identifying all historic discrepancies between legacy chains. As a result, history integrity checks have been moved to offchain tooling, to ensure a better balance between Superchain inclusivity and security.Let‚Äôs dive into both in more detail!Intermediate Control StructuresA small set of Chain Governors have expressed a strong desire for the ability to retain a blocking right over Protocol Upgrades for their specific chain, to prevent against governance or Security Council capture. This is a valid, but nuanced, request.On one hand, Optimism Governance is still evolving, and we feel that it is reasonable for chain governors entrusting the Collective to upgrade chains with large amounts of value to request some form of oversight as governance continues to mature.On the other hand, affording Chain Governors blocking rights over protocol upgrades for their specific chain poses meaningful risk. The Optimism Collective‚Äôs most crucial responsibility is to uphold the Law of Chains and its Protections when performing upgrades on behalf of its stakeholders. A malicious Chain Governor with a blocking right over protocol upgrades could, among other things:Block emergency security upgrades for their chain, resulting in loss of assets and violating the User Protection of state transition and messaging validity.Block regularly scheduled Protocol Upgrades for their chain, breaking blockspace homogeneity and violating the User Protection of Universal, Governance-approved Upgrades.As such, this updated draft of the Standard Rollup Charter includes a temporary solution intended to balance this tradeoff. In particular:A limited number of Chain Governors may be approved by Optimism Governance to have their upgrade keys held in an interim 3/3 multisig consisting of: (1) the Optimism Security Council, (2) the Optimism Foundation, and (3) the Chain Governor.These chains must be proposed by the Optimism Foundation via a Protocol Upgrade, and are subject to governance approval via the existing Protocol Upgrade Process.The initial chains, which would be subject to approval by ratification of the initial Standard Rollup Charter, are twofold: Base, and Unichain.We believe that this solution strikes a fair balance between empowering Optimism Governance and limiting the downside of malicious Chain Governors, while preserving the ability for key contributors to confidently and incrementally adopt Optimism Governance.Offchain History Integrity ChecksThe introduction of this Charter represents a transitional moment for the Superchain, and for the Collective; a unification of chains which were deployedbeforethe existence of Blockspace Charters or the Standard Rollup. As a result, it is important to consider not just the current version and configuration, but also the historic state of a chain which was deployed in the past. Historic chain management decisions can theoretically introduce future security vulnerabilities, even if the chain  passes all of the ‚Äúpresent-day‚Äù checks listed above.To date, there have been a number of observed  discrepancies between different chains which were previously launched, including:Deployment of intermediate versions: some chains were launched via intermediate commits of the OP Stack (i.e. commits ‚Äúin-between‚Äù two governance-approved releases)Temporary bugfixes, patches, and maintenance:some Chain Governors and Servicers have performed manual maintenance for purposes of security or quality-of-life, which caused short-lived deviations in their history.Inconsistent fork activation heights:some chains have activated forks at different times in their history.Predeploy inconsistency:some chains are missing certain predeployed contracts (e.g. the EAS) or have differing predeploy contracts (e.g. certain fee faults)These discrepancies may largely be reasonable, since they stem from actions taken before the clarity and specificity presented in this document. However, they vary in nature, and it is infeasible to capture them all through a constrained set of deterministic validation checks to prove that they are ‚Äúsafe.‚ÄùAs such, the Optimism Foundation has implemented a suite of history integrity checks, which can be used to identify historical discrepancies between chains and manually assess their impact. The Optimism Foundation will assess these discrepancies on an as-needed basis. If it believes that these discrepancies risk violating the Law of Chains (e.g., User Protections) in the future once the chain is added as a Standard Rollup, it will deny the chain‚Äôs inclusion, even if all other criteria in this document are met.The importance of history integrity checks should quickly diminish over time towards deprecation, since the expectation is that all Standard Rollups launched after the ratification of this Charter are deployed correctlyat launch.","This post details key updates to the Standard Rollup Charter since its v0.1 draft.  Two significant changes are:  1)  The introduction of temporary control structures allowing a limited number of chains (initially Base and Unichain)  a veto right in a 3/3 multisig for protocol upgrades, mitigating risks from malicious Chain Governors during Optimism Governance's maturation. 2) Shifting history integrity checks to off-chain tooling.  This addresses the operational overhead of programmatically identifying historical discrepancies across legacy chains, prioritizing Superchain inclusivity while maintaining security.  These off-chain checks assess historical deviations, ensuring compliance with the Law of Chains before chain inclusion.  The need for these checks will diminish as new Standard Rollups adhere to deployment standards.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Mofi, a protocol engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This upgrade is proposed in response to security vulnerabilities identified during a series of third-party security audits by Spearbit, Cantina, and Code4rena. None of the vulnerabilities have been exploited, and user assets are not and were never at risk. However, out of an abundance of caution, the permissioned fallback mechanism has been activated in order to avoid any potential instability while the vulnerabilities are patched. For more information on the permissioned fallback mechanism and the OP Stack‚Äôs defense-in-depth approach to Fault Proof security, see thedocumentation.The upgrade includes both a set of smart contract upgrades to fix the vulnerabilities identified in the audit as well as an L2 hardfork to improve the stability and performance of the fault proof system. In addition, we propose extending the capabilities of the Guardian and DeputyGuardian to set the anchor state for the fault proof system in order to prevent referencing invalid anchor states. Aside from implementing these fixes, the primary impact of this upgrade would be to reset user withdrawals at the planned time, similar to the initial Fault Proof upgrade.MotivationAs described in the original upgradeproposal, our rollout strategy for Fault Proofs focuses on securing the fundamental security mechanisms first, then building confidence on the correctness of the rest of the system over time. Successfully performing this strategy requires that:The fallback mechanisms are activated whenever there is a risk of a security vulnerability.Any vulnerabilities that may arise are swiftly patched.Therefore, the Foundation (via the Deputy Guardian role) activated the permissioned fallback which restricts output proposals to a trusted proposer and we at OP Labs created this proposal to resolve the vulnerabilities identified by the security audits. Note that the Guardian role is generally authorized to enforce ‚ÄúSafety over Liveness‚Äù in the system, meaning that it can pause and unpause withdrawals and as part of the Fault Proofs upgrade was authorized to intervene in the event that a bug would allow an invalid L2 output to be finalized.SpecificationsThe specification for the proposed changes can be found in thespecs repo. Details of the individual audit issues are enumerated in the Audit Issues section below.Technical DetailsIn the section below, we will summarize each of the audit issues we are fixing as well as the smart contracts/off-chain components affected by the upgrade. The full reports for each audit can be found here:SpearbitCantinaCode4renaNote that this upgrade only contains the most important issues (in our opinion) from each audit. We plan on addressing other, lower-severity issues in future upgrades.Audit IssuesThe table below lists all the audit issues that are fixed in this upgrade. Issue severities have been updated to match theOptimism ImmuneFi bounty. While the auditors did discover some high severity issues, no user assets were ever at risk. All of the audit issues listed below can be detected by our monitoring tooling. Had an exploit been detected, the Deputy Guardian role - which is held by the Optimism Foundation and revocable by the Security Council - would have been expected to blacklist any exploitable dispute games or activate the permissioned fallback.Note that we have updated the spec to clarify some assumptions around the Cannon VM and program. Specifically, we trust that the Go compiler will emit proper MIPS32 programs. As a result, the Cantina issues that reference problems related to invalid MIPS32 programs are considered out-of-scope and will not be fixed.Unless otherwise noted, vulnerabilities in the dispute game all occur at MAX_GAME_DEPTH and are therefore classified as medium.Issue IDSeveritySummaryCantina 3.1.1: Allocation overflow could allow for arbitrary code executionHighMmap calls did not perform memory bounds checking, which allowed memory pointers to wrap around to zero and access the entire memory of the fault proof program including the data and text sections of active MIPS programs. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the VM, effectively breaking the VM‚Äôs correctness guarantees. No PoC was given, and it is our belief that such an exploit is infeasible due to memory protections employed by the Go runtime. Nevertheless, given the potential impact of the issue we worked with the auditors to classify this as a high severity issue and deploy a fix.C4 H-01: Invalid DISPUTED_L2_BLOCK_NUMBER is passed to VMHighAn attacker can counter a valid output claim by providing a trace containing one block after the original claim. For example, if an output root is proposed for block 13, the attacker could counter using a trace that includes valid blocks up to block 14. This issue is classified as high severity since it occurs above MAX_GAME_DEPTH.Spearbit 5.1.1: PreimageOracle.loadPrecompilePreimagePart an outOfGas error in the precompile will overwrite correct preimagePartsMediumSee section below.C4 H-02: The LPP challenge period can cause malicious and freeloader claims to be uncounterable and can also cause freeloader claims to be abused to entrap honest challengersMediumThe clock extension mechanism is designed to give an honest actor time to counter freeloader claims, even though in that case they will inherit the opposing chess clock which may have very limited time remaining. Since the LPP challenge period was longer than the clock extension period, the clock extension granted in that case would not be sufficient to allow the honest actor to complete a call to step. While the overall game still resolves correctly, the challenger would lose bonds posted in attempting to counter the freeloader claim.C4 H-05: An attacker can bypass the challenge period during LPP finalizationMediumAn attacker can bypass the large preimage challenge period by calling addLeavesLPP with _finalize set to false. Since the challenge period timestamp is never set, attackers can then call squeezeLPP, thereby bypassing the challenge period and inserting invalid data into the preimage oracle.Cantina 3.3.5: Wrong implementation of sravLowThe srav instruction does not mask the 5 lower bits of rs, which is nonconformant with the MIPS specification. This could lead to undefined behavior.Cantina 3.4.2: Location of registers array in memory should be verifiedLowThe on-chain MIPS VM does not verify that the registers array is allocated right after the state struct. Validating this would make the code more defensive.Spearbit 5.2.5: Preimage proposals can be initialized multiple timesLowinitLPP() does not check if a proposal already exists. This could lead to loss of funds if a user provides the same LPP UUID multiple times.Spearbit 5.2.3: Extension period not applied correctly for next root when SPLIT_DEPTH is set to 1 or lessLowWhen SPLIT_DEPTH is set to 1, the extension period for the next root is calculated as zero which results in no extension period being applied. If SPLIT_DEPTH is set to zero, subsequent game moves will result due to an integer underflow.Spearbit 5.1.2: Invalid Ancestor Lookup Leading to Out-of-Bounds Array AccessLowAn out of bounds array access can occur when MAX_DEPTH = SPLIT_DEPTH + 1. While this is unlikely to happen in practice, we have updated the FDG constructor to require that SPLIT_DEPTH + 1 >= MAX_GAME_DEPTH.Spearbit 5.2.4: Inconsistent _partOffset check and memory boundaries in loadLocalData functionLowThe _partOffset parameter is handled inconsistently in some places within the loadLocalData function.Spearbit 5.2.6: _clockExtension and _maxClockDuration are not validated correctly in DisputeGame constructorLowIf a dispute game is initialized with a clock extension set to more than half of the max duration, move transactions during the execution trace bisection will revert since the difference between 2 * the clock extension and the game‚Äôs max duration will underflow.Notes on Spearbit 5.1.1By calling loadPrecompilePreimagePart with less gas than necessary, an attacker could produce an outOfGas error in the precompile. If there is enough gas left in the loadPrecompilePart function, a valid preimage could be overwritten with the outOfGas error itself. This would result in an incorrect game outcome.The function of the loadPrecompilePreimagePart method is to allow certain expensive precompiles - namely ecrecover, ecpairing, and kzg_point_evaluation - to be accelerated. Accelerated precompiles offload their execution to an L1 oracle. Since precompiles are implemented natively rather than via EVM opcodes, this improves Cannon‚Äôs performance and allows challengers to quickly generate traces for blocks filled with these computationally expensive calls. To address the outOfGas issue, we‚Äôre adding a minimum gas requirement to the PreimageOracle to ensure there‚Äôs enough gas to accelerate precompiles on L1.Another related issue with loadPrecompilePreimagePart is that the gas required to accelerate precompiles on L1 may be insufficient given the cost of executing them on L2. This is because the gas provided to the precompile accelerator contract on L1 can never exceed 63/64th of the gas limit on L2. This is a problem for precompiles that have a dynamic gas cost of execution. Of the accelerated precompiles, ecPairing is the only one that contains this vulnerability as its gas cost scales with its input size.To fix this problem, we are proposing an L2 hardfork to limit the maximum input size provided to the ecPairing precompile to 112687 bytes. This number is high enough to enable all known use cases of the ecPairing precompile, but low enough to enable the challenger to generate traces for larger blocks in a timely manner. While this is technically a divergence from the EVM, our on-chain data has found no calls to the ecPairing precompile with an input size over 1187 bytes. The provided limit is therefore 2 orders of magnitude larger than any known use case, which we believe is sufficiently safe.Additional FixesIn addition to the audit fixes above, we are also proposing the following additional fixes:We propose reducing the ChannelTimeout value from 200 blocks to 50. Canon has a limited amount of memory - approximately 1.1GB - and is not currently garbage collected. The longer channel timeout caused Cannon to run out of memory on OP Sepolia, and was close to the limit on mainnet. Reducing the ChannelTimeout significantly increases the amount of memory available to Cannon and reduces the risk of an OOM occurring.An ImmuneFi bounty hunter noticed that DelayedWETH‚Äôs recover function is not robust against transfers which need more than 2300 gas. We propose modifying DelayedWETH such that the owner can always recover funds regardless of how much gas is required.We have updated the Guardian and DeputyGuardian roles to have the permission to set the anchor state back to a valid game. This allows the DeputyGuardian to fix the anchor state registry in the event that a game with an invalid proposal incorrectly resolves asDEFENDER_WINS. Referencing existing game ensures the Guardian or Deputy Guardian can‚Äôt set an arbitrary anchor state - it has to be one that the fault dispute game found to be valid.All proposed contract changes can be found in the op-contracts/v1.6.0release.Impacted ComponentsThis upgrade involves both L1 smart contracts as well as the node and execution client software.The following contracts are modified as part of this upgrade:On-Chain MIPS VM:MIPS.solPreimageOracle.solDispute GameFaultDisputeGame.solPermissionedDisputeGame.solDelayedWETH.solDeputyGuardianModule.solAnchorStateRegistry.solOP Node has been updated to process the reduced ChannelTimeout. OP Geth has been updated to limit the maximum input size to ecPairing.Security ConsiderationsThese changes are all in response to vulnerabilities discovered during external security audits. No vulnerabilities were found in the fallback mechanisms, which were themselvesauditedprior to deploying Fault Proofs in June.As per theAudit Framework, the dispute game and MIPS contracts fall into the liveness/reputational risk category which do not require audits. The fallback mechanisms make any bugs simple to recover from and  pose no risk to user funds. Therefore, we have opted not to pursue a fix review for the changes made in this proposal. We propose addressing any additional issues discovered in a similar manner to the way they are being addressed here, specifically:Depending on the issues at hand, Labs recommend that the Deputy Guardian trigger the fallback or blacklist specific dispute games.Labs or (others in the core developer community) would create a governance proposal to resolve the issues.There‚Äôs quite a bit of nuance to when the fallbacks should be activated. In light of this audit, we propose adopting the following rubric to decide if/when the fallback should be activated. If an issue is costly to exploit - e.g., it requires playing the game to MAX_GAME_DETH - then we propose disclosing it immediately and using the dispute game blacklist to mitigate any attempts to exploit it. The dispute game blacklist will seize any bonds paid by an attacker, and makes attempting to exploit dispute resolution deeply unprofitable. On the other hand, if issues are not costly to exploit then we propose activating the fallback prior to disclosure. In both cases, fixes for the vulnerabilities would be proposed as a regular protocol upgrade in the nearest voting cycle.Consistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, we have not had the contents of the hardfork audited. However, OP Labs did perform a security review of these changes. Risk analysis of each L2 change is below.Limiting the size of ecPairing‚Äôs input is considered alow-riskchange. Implementation bugs would not put user assets at risk. Even though this is technically a divergence from the EVM, our data suggests that there have been no usages of the ecPairing precompile with an input size > 1152 bytes, which is far below the limit we will be imposing.Reducing the ChannelTimeout is considered alow-riskchange. Implementation bugs would not put user assets at risk.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.If this proposal is approved, node operatorsmustupgrade their node software prior to September 11th in order to avoid a chain split.As a result of triggering the fallback,all pending withdrawals will be invalidated. Users with pending withdrawals will need to re-prove them against an output proposal submitted by the permissioned proposer.This means that withdrawals initiated less than one week before the upgrade is executed will only be finalized one week after the upgrade is complete.For example, a withdrawal initiated 6 days before the upgrade would take a total of 13 days to finalize.In addition, proposals made within a week of the permissionless game being reactivated will also be invalidated.Users will be unable to provide more than 112687 bytes of input to the ecPairing precompile.Proposers (other than the trusted proposer operated by OP Labs) will be unable to propose their own outputs until the fallback is deactivated following the L1 upgrades.All client-side tooling is unaffected.Action PlanIf this vote passes, the Granite upgrade will be scheduled for execution on September 11th at 16:00:01 UTC. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked-in activation time. Granite is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit a81de910dc2fd9b2f67ee946466f2de70d62611a and op-geth at commit 0f5b9dcfd2ac66f6fd8faae526b1549721f5f392. The smart contracts release is op-contracts/v1.6.0-rc.1. The op-node and op-geth releases will be finalized if this proposal passes.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the Sepolia Superchain in coordination with Base and Conduit.The overall upgrade plan is as follows:Update the Absolute Pre-State:Prior to the hardfork activation, we will update the absolute pre-state as done in the Fjord upgrade. This ensures that the new op-program can be used with the upgraded protocol, and must be performed prior to hardfork activation. See the Fjord upgradeproposalfor more details. This upgrade is transparent to users, and no action is required.Activate the Hardfork on L2:The hardfork will activate on the L2 network at the scheduled time. Node operators must upgrade to the versions described above to avoid a chain split. Once upgraded, no further action is required.Update the L1 Smart Contracts:Finally, we will update the L1 smart contracts to new versions that contain fixes for the audit issues. This upgrade is transparent to users, and no action is required. This update will also deactivate the fallback mechanism, and revert back to permissionless proposing.The Security Council and Optimism Foundation must sign the transactions for steps 1 and 3 prior to the hardfork activation. This sequence is crucial to prevent breaking the fault proof system.Emergency CancellationThe releases above will contain a Granite activation at the above-mentioned time. If a critical security issue is found between approval and rollout, the Optimism Foundation and Security Council should coordinate an emergency cancellation. Node operators can quickly react by using the --override.granite flag on both op-node and op-geth.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the Granite network upgrade, which responds to security vulnerabilities identified by third-party auditors. This upgrade brings better security and performance to the fault proof system.Proposal Edit Changelog8/21/2024 - InAdditional Fixes- clarified the reason the Guardian and DeputyGuardian roles have extended capabilties.8/21/2024 - Added etherscan references to the newly deployed contract implementations.8/29/2024 - Fixed etherscan links to the deployed contract implementations","This proposal details the Optimism Granite network upgrade, addressing security vulnerabilities uncovered by Spearbit, Cantina, and Code4rena audits.  No vulnerabilities were exploited, but a permissioned fallback mechanism was activated as a precaution.  The upgrade includes smart contract fixes and an L2 hardfork enhancing fault proof system stability and performance.  It also extends Guardian/DeputyGuardian capabilities to prevent invalid anchor states.  While some high-severity issues were found, user assets were never at risk. Pending withdrawals will be reset, requiring re-submission. Node operators must upgrade by September 11th to avoid a chain split.  The upgrade is scheduled for September 11th, 16:00:01 UTC.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Quality standard for OP Stack chains,https://gov.optimism.io/t/quality-standard-for-op-stack-chains/8647,"We believe that the Superchain has reached a level of maturity where a basic quality standard is a good next step.  An Optimism quality standard would give third parties an understandable means to trust the software of the L2/3 of the Superchain. This forum post is looking for support from the Optimism community for this idea. Even if funded, without active support from the Optimism community any quality standard would simply be an easily ignored set of documents.  But creating this standard Optimism shows maturity and the advantages to using the OP Stack.The purpose of this forum post is to test if there is interest in proceeding further.Why develop a quality standard now?Imagine the question ‚ÄúWhich is safer, Base, Blast, Mode or OP?‚Äù  The answer should be simple, they are all safe as they are all based on the same OP Stack.  Instead, this one question drives 100 unanswered questions. How do you define safe? What version of OP Stack are they running? Is it the latest? Did they make changes on it? Did they test those changes? Should they? Why does the website and docs not address any of these questions? All of this makes the safety of the chains a question mark when it should be clear and transparent.A quality standard would answer all of these questions in a simple, clear and auditable way. It would give Superchains the incentive to do the boring but not excessive effort to prove they meet the quality standard.Broadly speaking what are the steps?Build a quality standardGet support from 3rd parties (protocols, bridges, insurance groups) that would prefer chains that use the standardHave the standard approved via an OP voteBuild a OP doc set so that Superchains understand the steps to take and how to show they are following them.Implementing the standard is optional, but if 3rd parties show advantages, the whole thing should be accepted by the chains.Update and improve the standard as time goes bySince I started DeFiSafety in 2020, I have been reviewing DeFi protocols on best practices and transparency.  So quality standards in DeFi has been my full time activity for four years.  I have found that on my own my impact is limited.  This is why active support from OP members is crucial to getting a standard accepted and in use.A quality standard for OP L2‚Äôs is low risk, low cost, achievable task that will help improve transparency and quality of the OP Superchain as it evolves.  I think it deserves consideration.","This proposal suggests creating a quality standard for Optimism Superchains to enhance trust and transparency.  Currently, comparing the safety of different Superchains built on the OP Stack is difficult due to a lack of standardized information.  A quality standard, developed with community support, would address this by providing a clear, auditable framework for evaluating Superchain security and adherence to best practices. This low-risk initiative would improve the overall quality and adoption of the Optimism ecosystem, benefiting third-party protocols, bridges, and insurance providers.  The author, with four years of experience in DeFi safety, seeks community support to make this happen.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Enable Custom Gas Token on OP Stack,https://gov.optimism.io/t/enable-custom-gas-token-on-op-stack/7834,"1.SummaryThis proposal from BNB Chain Core Team to allows Layer 2 networks that build on OP Stack to define its own gas token independently, instead of being limited to Layer 1‚Äôs gas token.2.AbstractIn the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a transaction call can be simply represented as a tuple{from, to, value, data, gaslimit}. OP Stack has implemented a seamless cross-chain transaction call between L1 and L2 layers: A transaction call happens on the source chain and will be fully executed on the target chain. Introducing the custom gas token will fundamentally change the meaning of thevaluefield in the tuple: the different gas tokens on L1 and L2 mean that the value of gas tokens is no longer equal. By adjusting the token handling logic in the cross-chain communication layer(PortalandL2toL1MessagePasser), OP Stack can keep the semantic of cross-chain transaction calls the same, reducing the impact on other components.The fee of cross-chain transactions is influenced by custom gas tokens due to the different prices of gas tokens. By implementing a token price oracle and considering token prices for fee calculations, the system can still maintain financial balance even if the income and expenses are two distinct tokens.3.MotivationMany projects aspire to deploy their own layer2 or even layer3 solutions for various reasons:Low Transaction Fees: Scenarios like GameFi, SocialFi, and DEX platforms demand extremely cost-effective transaction fees.Customized Chain Requirements: Projects often require customized features and rapid iterations such as precompiled contracts, shorter block times, and customized Abstract Account solutions.They often want to enhance project value by issuing tokens that can serve as gas tokens on Layer 2. However, OP Stack currently lacks support for this feature. Therefore, this draft focuses on enabling custom gas tokens on the OP Stack codebase.4.Specification828√ó250 21.7 KBThe current OP Stack‚Äôs cross-chain communication follows a layered model comprisingapplication layerandcommunication layer.4.1 Communication LayerThe communication layer is accessible without permission. Developers can build their cross-chain applications on this communication layer, and native Token Bridge is one of the applications.The communication layer is primarily responsible for two key functions.ÔºöImplement cross chain transaction calls. This is achieved through the collaboration ofPortal,MessagePassercontracts on two chains, along withop-node. The cross chain call can be represented as{from, to, mintValue, value, data, gaslimit}, themintValuemeans the amount of minted L2 gas token when deposit to L2, thevaluemeans the the transfer amount of L2 gas token to the to account.Verification of Cross-Chain messages. In the process of L1 to L2, the op-node observes the events on L1 and includes deposit transactions into blocks, verification passes only if it can reach state consensus. The tx from L2 to L1 is verified through Merkel proofs and fraud proofs.The introduction of custom gas tokens mainly impacts the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô field in cross-chain transaction calls. To remove ambiguity about the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù on both chains, we get two options here.4.1.1 Option1: Enhance Cross Chain Transaction CallA cross-chain transaction call can be represented asÔºö{from, to, mintValue, Value, remoteMintValue, remoteValue, data, gaslimit}.remoteMintValueandremoteValuerefer to the amount of gas token on another chain in a cross-chain transaction. ThePortal,MessagePasserand also theEVMneed to adapt to this change to handle the remote tokens.For example, thedepositTransactionofPortalneed to chargethe _remoteValueof custom gas token in ERC20 format, the logic will be like:On the other hand, when the L2 EVM handles theDepositTx, it will require to mint the L1 gas token on L2 in ERC20 format and transfer to the target account. These happen during the EVM transaction pre-execution phase, not within smart contracts.4.1.2 Option2: Wrap Cross Chain Transaction CallFor L1 to L2 transaction calls, invokingPortalwithmsg.valueis no longer allowed, a new parameter ‚ÄòmintValue‚Äô will be introduced. ThePortalneeds to transfer the mintValue amount of L2 custom gas token in ERC20 format frommsg.senderto itself. The previousopaqueData = abi.encodePacked(msg.value,_value,_gasLimit,_isCreation,_data)should be change toopaqueData = abi.encodePacked(‚ÄòmintValue‚Äô,_value,_gasLimit,_isCreation,_data)in thePortalcontract.For L2 to L1 transaction calls, invokingL2toL1MessagePasserwithmsg.valueis no longer allowed, a new parameter ‚ÄòcallValue‚Äô will be introduced. TheL2toL1MessagePasserneeds to transfer thecallValueamount of L1 gas token in ERC20 format frommsg.senderto itself. TheWithdrawalTransactioninL2toL1MessagePasserwill be changed from{ nonce: messageNonce(), ‚Ä¶ value: msg.value‚Ä¶} to { nonce: messageNonce(), ‚Ä¶ value: callValue‚Ä¶}4.1.3 ComparisonOption1‚Äôs framework is clearer but will require changes across multiple modules, including op-node and EVM. Option 2 is a simple and lightweight solution, however, its capability is slightly weaker than option1. Overall, the architecture of option1 is better .4.2 Application LayerTheMessengerandBridgemodules together form the entire application, enabling tokens to flow freely between two chains.Messengermanages message nonces and failure retry mechanisms.Bridgeacts as the gateway, providing user interfaces and managing token mapping relationships.The introduction of custom gas primarily impacts theBridgemodule in two aspects:interfaces changed; Introduce two new interfacesdepositGasTokenandwithdrawGasTokento reduce confusion, along with their correspondingfinalizeinterface on the other chain.the processing logic of gas tokens on both chains changed. Because the gas token is an ERC20 token on the other chain, this part should be properly handled.4.3 L1 to L2 FeeWhen a user initiates a deposit transaction on Layer 1 and specifies a gas limit, this transaction will ensure that an equivalent amount of gas limit is executed or burned on Layer 1 as a form of fee charge. This mechanism serves to prevent DoS attacks on Layer 2 through cross-chain transactions.If L2 adopts the custom gas token solution, there will be no need to charge fees by burning gas tokens on L1. When the gas limit exceeds a certain threshold, an amount ofgaslimit * L2 base feeof L2 custom gas token will be transferred from the user‚Äôs account to a treasury account in ERC20 format. In the ResourceConfig contract of L1, there are two parameters:minimumBaseFeeandmaximumBaseFee. By considering the prices of two gas tokens, setting these two parameters appropriately can makegaslimit * L2 base feeapproximately equal to the cost of executing this transaction on L2. The operator of L2 subsequently has the authority to withdraw L2 custom gas tokens from the treasury.4.4 L2 to L1 FeeWhen users send transactions on L2, they are required to pay anL1Feeto cover the costs of DA and fixed overhead. The calculation formula forL1Feeis:L1Fee = L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * FeeScalar. TheL1GasUsedis related to the length of transaction raw data and compression rate.Considering the different prices of gas tokens on two chains, a new operator will be introduced:TokenPriceRatio. The formula will be:L1GasPrice = L1GasPrice * TokenPriceRatioL1Fee = L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * FeeScalarHowever, the value ofTokenPriceRatiocannot be automatically calculated by the system; it requires an Oracle mechanism where an off-chain service feeds the price into the L2 contract. Price feeds come in different forms and algorithms, OP Stack can leave it to the maintainer of L2. Even if the price feed lags or is inaccurate, it won‚Äôt cause major financial losses, but may create an imbalance between income and expenses in a short period.4.5 Wrap Gas TokenSince the gas token is a wrapped ERC20 token on another chain, the ERC20 needs to be deployed in advance and maintained as globally unique. Typically, the gas token wrapped in L1 already exists, so all that‚Äôs required is to pre-deploy the ERC20 format contract of the L1 gas token on L2. The issue of other L2 tokens remains unchanged.","This proposal allows BNB Chain's OP Stack Layer 2 networks to utilize custom gas tokens, rather than relying solely on the Layer 1 token.  This addresses project needs for lower transaction fees and customized features.  The proposal modifies the cross-chain transaction call structure (Option 2 is preferred for simplicity) to accommodate the custom token's value.  A token price oracle will manage fee calculations, ensuring financial balance despite varying token prices.  The Layer 1 to Layer 2 fee will be managed by transferring a custom gas token amount to a treasury, while the Layer 2 to Layer 1 fee will utilize a token price ratio provided by an oracle.  Finally, the necessary ERC20 tokens must be pre-deployed.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Zk fault proof for OP Stack,https://gov.optimism.io/t/zk-fault-proof-for-op-stack/8648,"Hi, We are the cryptographic team in the BNB Chain. We are constantly updating our knowledge of the latest zero-knowledge proof techniques for layer 2s and other use cases.Recently, we proposed a zero-knowledge-based solution (partially utilizing the circuit proposed by the Polygon Zero team) for opBNB fraud-proof, and we think it could also be used for OP Stack.We respectfully submit our proposals here for your consideration and feedback.As a new user, I can only upload one embeddable picture. If you want to review the full article, please kindly visitZk fault proof for opBNB - opBNB - Build N Build Forum (bnbchain.org)Background - generic VM v.s. custom circuitIn the last year, Optimism initiated aFoundation Mission Requestto develop the Op Stack Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for verifying the correctness of its fault proof program. Once implemented, this ZKP can reduce the challenge period for Optimism from 7 days to 12 hours and avoid complicated interactive challenge procedures. Optimism accepted and funded three proposals from Risc Zero, O(1) Labs, and the ETH Storage team. Each team proposes a similar approach, where the fault proof program, written in Go or Rust, is compiled into a generic instruction set such as RISCV, WASM, or MIPS. These compiled instructions are then verified for correctness using zkVMs like zkRISCV, zkWASM, or zkMIPS, which we refer to as the generic VM approach. An alternative approach involves developing a custom circuit for the fault proof program, which we believe offers better performance compared to the generalized VM method. Recently, Polygon Zero announced the development of a highly performant type1 zkEVM, which aligns with our expectations for creating a custom circuit for opBNB‚Äôs fault proof program. Therefore, we have decided to develop a proof of concept (PoC) based on Polygon Zero‚Äôs type1 zkEVM codebase to demonstrate the performance advantages compared to the generalized VM approach. The PoC involves the protocol specific to Optimism, and can be used to generate ZKP for Optimism blocks. The figure below illustrates the simple workflow of the two approaches. It is worth noting that our proposal aims not only to improve performance but also to enhance the robustness of the Optimism multi-proofs system.image844√ó630 58.6 KBCurrent Fault Proof OverviewBefore delving into the ZK fault proof design, Let‚Äôs quickly review the current optimism fault proof design.The offchain fault proof program consists of two parts:Derive the disputed block from the anchor L1 block hash;Execute the disputed block based on the agreed L2 state root and compare the execution result with the claimed output rootThe onchain fault dispute game works as following:The attacker and defender take turns initiating on-chain actions based on the claims submitted on-chain by their opponents until they agree on the disputed L2 block;They then repeat the above challenge process until they agree on the disputed instruction of the off-chain fault proof program, which uses the disputed L2 block as the input;Then invoke the on-chain MIPS contract to execute the disputed instruction which will determine the winnerThe above fault proof design has following disadvantages:The attacker or defender needs to send many on-chain transactions, resulting in significant gas cost;The attacker or defender is susceptible tocensorship attacks, where transactions become harder to include in the L1 chain due to congestion created by either party. To mitigate this risk, the on-chain dispute game must allocate sufficient time for each player to act, resulting in the long challenge periodArchitecture of ZK Fault ProofThe ZK solution for fault proof is designed to address the aforementioned disadvantages. The following figure illustrates the components and workflow of the ZK fault proof design.As a new user, I can only upload one embeddable picture. If you want to review the full article, please kindly visitZk fault proof for opBNB - opBNB - Build N Build Forum (bnbchain.org)Optimism Block Execution Circuit: This circuit processes L2 blocks according to the Optimism state transition protocol and generates an execution proof to verify the correctness of the L2 block;Optimism Block Derivation Circuit: Derivation means deriving L2 blocks from L1 data. This circuit encodes the Optimismblock derivation logicfrom an L1 block hash and produces a derivation proof to verify the correctness of the derived L2 block;Fault Proof Circuit: This circuit encodes the ZKP verification logic to validate both the execution proof and derivation proof, and includes the consistency check logic between the public inputs of the circuits;zkFaultProofVerifier Contract: This contract resides on the L1 chain and is used to verify the correctness of the ZK fault proof, determining which party wins.The challenger monitors the L2 output root proposed on-chain by the proposer. Upon finding an invalid output root, the challenger can generate a ZK fault proof for the disputed L1 block and submit it to the zkFaultProofVerifier contract. If the verification passes, the challenger wins.The ZK fault proof approach has the following advantages:Challenger only needs to submit one on-chain transaction to the L1 which greatly reduce the gas cost;Since the dispute result can be determined with just a single transaction, the challenger is less susceptible to censorship attacks. Therefore, the challenge period can be appropriately reduced to improve user experience.Our workTo demonstrate the performance advantages of the custom circuit, we quickly developed a POC based on type1 zkEVM. This POC only includes the Optimism block execution circuit, which is the most time-consuming of all the circuits mentioned above. The adoption work we have done is as follows:Changed the gas fee calculation mechanism according to Optimism/opBNB protocol;Optimism/opBNB transaction fees consist of two components: the Execution Gas Fee and the L1 Data Fee. The Execution Gas Fee covers the cost of executing transactions on L2, similar to Ethereum‚Äôs gas fee. The L1 Data Fee covers the cost of publishing L2 transaction data on Ethereum. More information can be foundhereAdded the handling logic for Deposited Transaction and Deposit Receipt;Deposited Transactions are derived from L1, and included in a L2 block. There are two kinds of deposited transactions: L1 attributes deposited transaction (submits the L1 block‚Äôs attributes to the L1 Attributes Pre-deployed Contract) and User deposited transactions (transactions derived from an L1 call to the deposit contract). More information can be foundhereFix bugs in the MPT trace generation codes;Add parallelization code for transaction proof generationPerformance TestingWe conducted a performance test for the same L2 batch using the opBNB custom circuit and Zeth developed by Risc Zero. The opBNB custom circuit is more efficient than the generic VM approach, generating 10 times fewer ZK cycles and proving 5-6 times faster than zeth.

For the same batch, the number of ZK cycles generated by the generic VM method is 10 times that of the type1 zkEVM;From the perspective of proving time, when we consider the fixed server costs for the opBNB custom circuit and zeth, the opBNB is 5-6 times faster than zeth;Similarly, when considering generating ZKPs within the same time window, we can conclude that the opBNB custom circuit approach is 5-6 times cheaper than zeth based on the generic VM approach.There are some batches(113963903, 114223488, 114511643) where the performance of the opBNB custom circuit doesn‚Äôt meet expectations.Future workThe type1 zkEVM is currently in development, with features like continuations designed to make proof generation more parallel-friendly. Additionally, efforts are underway to enhance the performance of the backend proving system. The opBNB team can contribute to these planned improvements. We believe that the performance of the opBNB custom circuit approach will significantly improve as the performance of the type 1 zkEVM continues to advance.To achieve a complete ZK fault proof for Optimism or opBNB, we need to implement all the components such as the block derivation circuit, fault proof circuit, and the on-chain zkFaultProofVerifier contract. These will be important tasks for the next phase of our PoC.Once the development of the opBNB custom circuit design is complete, the opBNB team will contribute this work to the Optimism ecosystem to enhance the security and performance of the multi-proof system.","The BNB Chain cryptographic team proposes a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) solution for opBNB fraud proofs, leveraging Polygon Zero's zkEVM.  This custom circuit approach, unlike generic VM methods (e.g., zkRISCV), significantly improves performance, achieving 5-6 times faster proving time and 10 times fewer ZK cycles than a comparable system (Zeth).  Their proof-of-concept, focusing on the most computationally intensive Optimism block execution circuit, demonstrates this advantage, although further optimization is anticipated with zkEVM advancements.  This ZKP solution reduces gas costs and enhances resistance to censorship attacks by requiring only a single on-chain transaction to resolve disputes, aiming to shorten challenge periods.  Future work includes implementing remaining circuit components and contributing the complete solution to the Optimism ecosystem.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Upgrade Proposal #9: Fjord Network Upgrade,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-9-fjord-network-upgrade/8236,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Roberto, an engineer at Coinbase working on the Base blockchain, and a core developer of the OP Stack. I reviewed this proposal in collaboration with Sebastian Stammler and Dragan Zurzin from the OP labs team.Neither Coinbase nor I represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.This is a proposal for the Fjord network upgrade, which includes the EIP-7212 precompile to reduce gas costs of many smart wallet applications, supports Brotli batch compression for ~5-15% lower data availability costs, and improves the robustness of L1 data pricing. The upgrade also increases and hardcodes the max-sequencer-drift parameter, giving chain operators more time to respond to L1 node issues without facing a potential L2 chain halt.SpecificationsTechnical SpecificationWe propose the Fjord network upgrade (spec overview), which activates:RIP-7212: Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support (spec)Brotli as a channel compression option (spec)FastLZ based L1 data availability cost calculation (spec), including an upgradedGasPriceOracleL2 predeploy to compute it (spec).Parameter changes:Max sequencer drift becomes a constant with value increased to 1800 seconds (spec)Increased values forMAX_RLP_BYTES_PER_CHANNELandMAX_CHANNEL_BANK_SIZE(spec)The Fjord hardfork activation block, which includes several transactions to perform all L2 contract deployments, upgrades, enablements, and proxy updates. (spec)The upgrade also updates and deprecates:getL1GasUsedmethod of theGasPriceOraclecontract (spec)L1GasUsedfield of the transaction receipt (spec)Security ConsiderationsConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, we did not have the contents of Fjord audited; however, Coinbase and OP Labs engineers did perform a security review of these changes.The Fjord upgrade‚Äôs inclusion of EIP-7212 involves use of the reference implementation that is already live on other blockchains, which we consider low risk.Brotli compression is also a low-risk change since it is already used by other L2s and was evaluated for both its runtime performance and compression improvements across four different OP-stack chains. It‚Äôs usage is also optional and must be activated by the chain operator after the upgrade in order to be applied.The introduction of the new L1 data fee cost function required updates to the GasPriceOracle L2 predeploy, and changes op-geth to compute the fee values. The contract extension allows developers to continue using the GasPriceOracle to compute the data fee, and affects only helper functions that are outside of consensus.  We extensively evaluated the accuracy of this new function compared to multiple variants as well as the previous one across various timeslices of OP mainnet and Base mainnet transactions (analysis repo). The new function consistently produced significant improvements in mean-squared-error and mean-absolute-error across each, and we were unable to find any instances where the new function could wildly diverge from ground truth. (We computed ground truth by putting the transaction in a simulated batch, compressing the entire batch with Brotli-10, and returning the number of bytes occupied by the transaction in the result.) Bugs in the op-geth computation might still lead to under/over payment for L1 data fees by users. Significant underpayment could result in revenue loss for the chain operator, but the system provides parameters that can be updated quickly via the SystemConfig in order to quickly compensate for such scenarios. Overall we feel this change remains low risk.Similar to the previous upgrade, Fjord uses a special upgrade block to perform the contract deployment and activation on the L2. Bugs in this code could lead to an incomplete fork with missing contracts or contract functionality expected by the upgrade, in the worst case leading to chain halt. Since this approach to automating the upgrade has been used successfully in the past, we consider this low risk.Security considerations for the parameter changes are discussed in the upgrade specificationhereandhere. These changes are also straightforward and we consider them low risk.Impact SummaryWe do not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.Bringing EIP-7212 to the OP stack will benefit applications such as smart wallets that want to support many common authentication methods (such as Apple‚Äôs FaceID) that would otherwise be too gas intensive.We evaluated Brotli compression compared to the previous compression algorithm (zlib) on 4 OP stack chains (OP mainnet, Base, Zora, and Mode) and found compression ratio improvements ranging from 5-15% under Brotli quality level 10. This will directly translate to a 5-15% reduction in L1 data availability costs, so we expect most chains will want to activate this feature immediately following the upgrade.The FastLZ based L1 data fee function will more accurately charge for L1 data usage on a per transaction basis. Previously, highly incompressible transactions might be undercharged for L1 data usage, and a large number of such transactions might lead to an inability to recover revenue without the chain operator having to take action by re-tuning fee parameters.  We expect this new function to far more accurately detect the (lack of) compressibility of each individual transaction and reduce the chance of revenue recovery drifting from its intended target.The main impact of the parameter changes is that chain operators will have more time to respond to L1 node outage issues before the L2 chain stalls (30 minutes instead of 10 minutes).Action Plan for this releaseIf this vote passes, the Fjord upgrade will be scheduled for execution on July 10th at 16:00:01 UTC. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Fjord is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commitf8143c8cbc4cc0c83922c53f17a1e47280673485and op-geth at commit7c2819836018bfe0ca07c4e4955754834ffad4e0. The op-node releasev1.7.7and op-geth releasev1.101315.2contain these changes.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the Sepolia Superchain in coordination with Base and Conduit.Fault Proofs UpdateThis is the first protocol upgrade that will activate on mainnet following the launch of Fault Proofs, which has recently been accepted bygovernance. However, its version of the op-program and Fault Dispute Game doesn‚Äôt contain the Fjord mainnet activation yet, so we need to perform an update of the Fault Proofs L1 infrastructure before the Fjord activation on mainnet. This is the first time that we need to perform this exercise.This update involves a new release of theop-program(v1.2.0) that contains the Fjord activation and generate the so-calledabsolute pre-statefor it, which is a commitment to the program and its starting state. It also requires deploying newFaultDisputeGameandPerimissionedDisputeGamecontracts to L1 Mainnet with the new op-program pre-state hash. These are deployed at addresses0xf691F8A6d908B58C534B624cF16495b491E633BAand0xc307e93a7c530a184c98eade4545a412b857b62frespectively. After the veto period has ended, we will ask the Security Council to sign transactions to update theDisputeGameFactoryto begin using these new contract implementations. This transaction has to be executedbeforethe actual Fjord activation to avoid a broken Fault Proofs system after the activation.Emergency CancellationThe optimistic mainnet releases will contain a Fjord activation at the above mentioned time. If there is a critical security issue found between approval and rollout, the Optimism Foundation and Security Council will work to coordinate an emergency cancellation.  We have included functionality for node operators to quickly react by using the--override.fjordflag on both op-node & op-geth.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the network upgrade after Ecotone titled Fjord. This network upgrade brings reduced execution fees for certain (e.g. smart wallet) applications, lower data availability costs, and more robust L1 data pricing. We expect that this upgrade will not result in any downtime and will occur on Wednesday, July 10 2024 at 16:00:01 UTC.","The Fjord network upgrade enhances the Optimism OP Stack, reducing gas costs for smart wallets (EIP-7212), lowering data availability costs (Brotli compression), and improving L1 data pricing accuracy.  It increases the max-sequencer-drift, preventing chain halts.  Security reviews were conducted, and risks are deemed low.  The upgrade, scheduled for July 10th, 16:00:01 UTC, includes updated contracts and requires a Fault Proofs infrastructure update beforehand.  No downtime is anticipated.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,[FINAL] Governor Update Proposal #2: Improvements to advanced delegation allowance calculations,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-governor-update-proposal-2-improvements-to-advanced-delegation-allowance-calculations/8164,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend atvote.optimism.io. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This Governor upgrade introduces improvements to the Alligator allowance storage system that enabled partial delegation and sub delegation for OP voters. Since it‚Äôs launch in December of 2023, delegates using advanced delegation, especially those who received delegation using absolute and relative amounts, could have ended up with less voting power than they should have had. We identified this and other related cases where recorded votes were preventing correct calculation of voting power, which resulted in the additional tests and the logic refactor being proposed.If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade the governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.MotivationAs part ofthe v2 upgrade of the token housewe shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called ‚Äúadvanced delegation‚Äù, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements.This improvement builds on the real world experience of using advanced delegation and Alligator in the wild and covers scenarios that we did not capture during testing, especially situations such as:A partially delegates to B and CC partially delegates to D and EE partially delegates to FY partially delegates to W and ZZ partially delegates to A and FWithout this change, depending on how these votes were partially delegated either via absolute or relative weights, there is a chance that F‚Äôs voting power would have been less than it should have been. It‚Äôs important to note that this hasn‚Äôt happened in production, and this update to make sure it doesn‚Äôt.We identified this and other related cases where recorded votes were preventing correct calculation of voting power, which resulted in the additional tests and the logic refactor being proposed.Impact to voters:Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience especially if they find themselves in complex delegation states where some users delegated to them with relative power, and other delegated to them with absolute power.Note on timing:We‚Äôre aware that delegates were previously asked to vote on another advanced delegation upgrade proposal, so some may be wondering why these updates were not batched. The reason for this is that, due to auditor availability, we could only ship the full scope of changes several weeks after they were completed. Some of the changes included improvements to the voting experience ‚Äì so we worked out a deal with the audit team to audit that part first so that voters may benefit from that change asap. This current vote is for the rest of the changes.SpecificationsContract ChangedTheOptimism Governorwould be changed as part of this upgrade.

the m‚Ä¶ain correction comes from the assumption that:
- absolute allowances are related to **all votes cast by a delegate** regardless of authority chains
- relative allowances are related to **votes cast by a delegate via a certain authority chain**

this should fix should solve most scenarios, but more tests (especially fuzz) are needed to make sure all edge cases are covered and the desired outcome is always achieved.

There are no state changes to any governance contracts in this upgrade.Security ConsiderationsThis change has been audited by Open Zeppelin. There were no issues identified given that it‚Äôs a minimal change which doesn‚Äôt affect the rest of the contract logic.

Password to view is:1jw2KTKDdJ356UMbImpact SummaryAgora does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade. As of this proposal there is a small number of users with advanced voting power, therefore the potential exposure is minimal.Action PlanIf approved by governance, the Optimism Foundation admin will set the new implementation of governor proxy at0xcDF27F107725988f2261Ce2256bDfCdE8B382B10to new implementation deployed at0xb7b1c8d8cc590b91623f493af3ee8c0a0a282b74If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, Agora will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.ConclusionThis proposal outlines changes to the governor that will allow for more complex delegation states to be achieved by OP voters using the Alligator contract. These improvements have been audited and no issues have been found.","This proposal upgrades the Optimism Governor contract to improve its Alligator allowance system, addressing issues with advanced delegation impacting voting power calculations.  A December 2023 upgrade introduced ""advanced delegation,"" allowing complex voting power delegation. This update corrects calculation flaws identified in scenarios involving partial and sub-delegation, ensuring accurate voting power reflection.  The OpenZeppelin-audited changes enhance user experience for delegates with complex delegation structures.  No downtime is anticipated; the upgrade involves replacing the existing governor proxy with a new implementation.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,[FINAL] Protocol Upgrade #7: Fault Proofs,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Adrian, a protocol engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This protocol upgrade reduces the trust assumptions for users of OP Mainnet by enabling permissionless output proposals and a permissionless fault proof system. As part of a responsible and safe rollout of Fault Proofs, it preserves the ability for the guardian to override if necessary to maintain security. As a result, withdrawals no longer depend on the privileged proposer role posting an output root, allowing the entire withdrawal process to be completed without any privileged actions. The trust assumption is reduced to requiring only that the guardian role does not act to intervene. Combined with theGuardian, Security Council Threshold and L2 ProxyAdmin Ownership changesproposal, we believe this satisfies the criteria to have OP Chains reach Stage 1 status.If this vote passes and becomes the new governance-approved version of the OP Stack, the upgrade will be deployed to OP Mainnet by the Security Council (currently in Phase 0, which is a joint 2/2 multisig between the Security Council Safe and the Foundation‚Äôs Safe) shortly after the end of the veto period.MotivationSecuring withdrawals with a Fault Proof system is a key requirement for meeting thestage 1decentralization milestone with the ultimate goal of enhancing the security of user assets.This upgrade enables a permissionless Fault Proof system which allows anyone to propose output roots and participate in the dispute system. As a result, users will be able to withdraw assets from L2 to L1 without relying on the sequencer or any other centralized infrastructure.As part of a responsible and safe rollout of Fault Proofs, it is required that at this stage, the existingGuardian rolecapabilities are carried over to this new version, meaning that the Guardian can disable the Fault Proof system in the event of emergency. While this means the system is still not fully trustless - as is the nature of Stage 1 designation - it reduces the trust assumption to requiring only that the Guardian role does not act maliciously, rather than requiring a single permissioned proposer to actively propose. This proposed upgrade extends the Guardian role‚Äôs pause ability to be able to disable the fault proof system, an extension of its existing capabilities in the fault proofs context. For more info on how the Guardian role is expected to be permissioned, seethis post.This upgrade also includes a smart contract framework that provides a solid basis for a future multi-proof system, allowing additional proof systems to easily be added. This will further reduce trust assumptions in later upgrades as the OP Stack moves towards achieving Stage 2 decentralization.SpecificationsThe full specifications for the fault dispute system are availablefrom the specs repo. If this proposal is approved, the fault dispute system specs will be promoted from the experimental section of specs, to be part of the canonical spec.Technical DetailsThis upgrade does not affect the node or execution client software.Prior to the upgrade, the fault dispute system contracts have been deployed:DisputeGameFactory(implementation:0xc641A33cab81C559F2bd4b21EA34C290E2440C2Bproxy:0xe5965Ab5962eDc7477C8520243A95517CD252fA9) - a factory for creating dispute games that can be used by the upgradedOptimismPortalas the source of proposed output roots.FaultDisputeGame(0x4146DF64D83acB0DcB0c1a4884a16f090165e122) - an implementation of a dispute game that uses permissionless, interactive bi-section of the chain stateThis is initialized with anABSOLUTE_PRESTATEof0x037ef3c1a487960b0e633d3e513df020c43432769f41a634d18a9595cbf53c55. This is the initial state for the Cannon MIPS VM to runop-programtagged in the optimism repo at commita6d4eeda11477adfcd106e03131625a40334e3a6(tagged as releaseop-program/v1.0.0). This prestate can be rebuilt using themake reproducible-prestatecommand (docs)PermissionedFaultDisputeGame(0xE9daD167EF4DE8812C1abD013Ac9570C616599A0) - extendsFaultDisputeGameto restrict participation to privileged roles. This can be used as a fallback in the event of failure of the fault dispute game.AnchorStateRegistry(implementation:0x6B7da1647Aa9684F54B2BEeB699F91F31cd35Fb9proxy:0x18DAc71c228D1C32c99489B7323d441E1175e443) - stores the latest ‚Äúanchor‚Äù state for each availableFaultDisputeGametype. By using stored anchor states, new FaultDisputeGame instances can be initialized with a more recent starting state which reduces the amount of required offchain computation.This is initialized with the starting anchor forCANNONandPERMISSIONED_CANNONgames set to block number 120059863 and output root0x2694ac14dcf54b7a77363e3f60e6462dc78da0d43d1e2f058dbb6a1488814977.As the fault dispute system contracts are deployed ahead of time and are permissionless, it is possible for dispute games to be created prior toOptimismPortalbeing upgraded. If these games resolve that the output root is valid, theAnchorStateRegistrywill be updated with the new value. The validity of the current value of theAnchorStateRegistrywill be manually verified as part of the upgrade process.DelayedWETH(implementation:0x97988d5624F1ba266E1da305117BCf20713bee08proxy:0xE497B094d6DbB3D5E4CaAc9a14696D7572588d14) - an extension to WETH9 that allows for delayed withdrawals. This introduces a time delay before bonds posted as part of aFaultDisputeGamecan be withdrawn, allowing the Guardian role to change the allocation of bonds if there is a bug in theFaultDisputeGameto preserve incentive compatibility.PreimageOracle(0xD326E10B8186e90F4E2adc5c13a2d0C137ee8b34) - stores validated pre-images that can be retrieved by hash. This is used byop-programand other fault proof programs to retrieve data required to perform the derivation process and validate the output root.MIPS(0x0f8EdFbDdD3c0256A80AD8C0F2560B1807873C9c) - the Cannon MIPS VM implementation. Executes a single MIPS CPU instruction on-chain as part of thestepcall to determine the validity of claims at the bottom level of the dispute game.There are also two off-chain programs provided to support users interacting with the fault proof system:op-challenger- implements the honest actor algorithm for theFaultDisputeGameto automatically challenge invalid output root proposals and defend valid ones.op-dispute-mon- monitors the fault proof system, exposing a variety of metrics that enable monitoring and alerting of the fault proof system, such as when games are forecast or have resolved with a status that is inconsistent with the localop-nodeused byop-dispute-mon.The following changes are being introduced with the upgrade:Upgrade theOptimismPortalcontract (0xe2F826324b2faf99E513D16D266c3F80aE87832B) that uses theDisputeGameFactoryas the source of output proposals. (spec)TheproveWithdrawalTransactionmethod is modified, retaining the same signature function but with the second argument now providing an index within theDisputeGameFactory‚Äôs list of created games.Enforces an air-gap requiring a period of time (DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS) to have elapsed since the game resolved before the game can be used in a call tofinalizeWithdrawalTransaction.The Guardian role can blacklist dispute games or change theRESPECTED_GAME_TYPEto invalidate dispute games in the event of failures in the fault proof system.Users are now able to reprove their withdrawals at any time. Previously, a user could only reprove their withdrawal if the output root was removed from theL2OutputOracleby the guardian, but with this upgrade users will be able to reprove their withdrawal at any time. This allows users to change the dispute game their withdrawal is proven against if needed without waiting for the game to actually resolve as invalid. The 7 day withdrawal finalization delay resets when a user reproves their withdrawal to ensure there is still a full 7 day air-gap between proving and finalizing the withdrawal.TheL2OutputOraclecontract is no longer usedTheSystemConfigcontract (0xF56D96B2535B932656d3c04Ebf51baBff241D886) is updated to:reference theDisputeGameFactoryaddress instead of theL2OutputOracleaddress.enforce a maximum block gas limit of 200,000,000 to prevent the gas limit being raised to the point where block execution is too resource intensive to be processed in cannon as part of the fault dispute system.remove thesetResourceConfigsetter to prevent theSystem Config Owner, from misconfiguring the resource config and preventing force inclusions from L1 (e.g. by setting the maximum deposit gas too low). The resource config can now only be changed by upgrading theSystemConfigcontract which is controlled by theL1 Proxy Admin(a 2-of-2 multisig with the Optimism Foundation and Security Council).These contracts are tagged in the optimism repo at commit547ea72d9849e13ce169fd31df0f9197651b3f86(tagged as release candidateop-contracts/v1.4.0-rc.4).Security ConsiderationsOur design philosophy has been to focus on fundamental safety mechanisms first. We acknowledge that gaining certainty in the correctness of the complex logic found within the FaultDisputeGame contract, its dependencies, and the offchain op-challenger software will take time. Therefore, we have included a number of fallback mechanisms designed to maintain the safety of the system even in the event of a complete failure of those complex components - in particular the ability for the Guardian role to pause withdrawals and disable the Fault Proof System.The Sherlock community completed asuccessful bug hunt, focused on issues which would allow these fundamental safety mechanisms to be subverted. See thefinal reportfor further details. The reported issues have been addressed. As none of the reported issues circumvented the fundamental safety mechanisms we decided not to pursue a fix review.Impact SummaryAs part of the upgrade, all pending withdrawals will be invalidated. Users with pending withdrawals will need to re-prove their withdrawals against an output proposal submitted in the form of aFaultDisputeGamewhich will restart the withdrawal delay period.This means that withdrawals initiated less than one week before the upgrade is executed will only be finalized one week after the upgrade is complete.For example, a withdrawal initiated 6 days before the upgrade would take a total of 13 days to finalize.Users reading output roots from theL2OutputOraclecontract will need to update to read from theDisputeGameFactory.OP Labs does not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade, and node operators are not affected.While the normal case for dispute games allows them to resolve within the 7 day withdrawal delay period, the maximum possible time for a dispute game to resolve is 16 days which may lengthen the withdrawal delay for withdrawals proven against that dispute game. Extending a game to this point incurs a significant cost and users may reprove their withdrawal against a different output root at any time. TheGame Clock section of the specsprovides further details.Tooling that performs withdrawals will need to be updated to use the newDisputeGameFactoryas the source of output roots when proving withdrawals. New versions of the Optimism SDK and viem have already been released with this support.Action PlanIf this proposal passes a Token House vote, the L1 contracts will be upgraded following the completion of the Citizens‚Äô House Veto Period following Voting Cycle#23a. Prior to upgrading, the anchor state in theAnchorStateRegistrywill be validated manually. If the value is invalid due to a game having resolved incorrectly prior to full deployment, a replacement version of theAnchorStateRegistrywill be deployed using the starting anchor in this proposal, before upgrading contracts. The upgrade will be completed atomically such that all affected L1 contracts will be upgraded within a single transaction.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the op-sepolia testnet.As this is a L1 contracts-only upgrade, no action is required by node operators.To prepare infra and the community for withdrawal flow changes, we will be rolling out mainnet messaging starting this week. This will expand on thepreparation for breaking changesimplemented with contributors for OP Sepolia, which we coordinated with ~30 infra teams and several rounds of public posts. Mainnet communication will include:Comms: At least two rounds of public messaging on OP social channels notifying users of the changes to withdrawal flow, and of the impact on withdrawals during the upgrade window.Contributors: Coordinate with bridge infra contributors, including maintainers of popular frontends to the standard bridge, to post banners notifying users of the changes.Support: Prep developer support team for inbound support tickets about transactions that need to be reproven due to not finishing the first proof in time before the changes.Bridges:Notify bridges and other infra contributors whose operations might be impacted due to the withdrawal flow changes.If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, OP Labs will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.ConclusionThe deployment of a permissionless Fault Dispute System to OP Mainnet is a major step forward on the path to decentralization. This proposal is a responsible approach to the roll out, preserving the safety checks and functionality of the Guardian role while still benefiting from permissionless output proposals and laying a foundation for reaching stage 2 decentralization.","This OP Labs proposal upgrades Optimism's OP Mainnet to a permissionless fault proof system for withdrawals, reducing trust assumptions.  Anyone can now propose output roots and participate in dispute resolution, eliminating reliance on a privileged proposer.  The Guardian role retains override capability for safety.  This upgrade, combined with other changes, aims to achieve Stage 1 decentralization.  Pending withdrawals will be invalidated, requiring reproving.  The upgrade, already tested on devnets and testnets, involves updating L1 contracts and requires no node operator action, though tooling and bridge infrastructure will need updates.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,"[FINAL] Protocol Upgrade #8: Guardian, Security Council Threshold and L2 ProxyAdmin Ownership changes for Stage 1 Decentralization",https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-8-guardian-security-council-threshold-and-l2-proxyadmin-ownership-changes-for-stage-1-decentralization/8157,"Hi Maurelian here, I‚Äôm a protocol security engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.Executive SummaryThe protocol upgrade is intended to increase the security and decentralization of the Superchain by meeting the following requirements:Increasing the Security Council Safe‚Äôs signing threshold, from 4 to 10, out of 13 owners. This meets the 75% threshold requirement for a Stage 1 rollup outlined inL2Beat‚Äôs Stages framework.Reassigning the role of Guardian from the Foundation to a new Guardian Safe with the Security Council Safe as its sole owner. This moves the Superchain closer to satisfying the 1 weekexit windowrequirement for Stage 1.Additionally the Foundation is appointed to the new DeputyGuardian role which is able to act as Guardian through the Guardian Safe. This appointment can be revoked by the Security Council Safe at any time.Even though the appointment of the DeputyGuardian is closer to a change in configuration than version, it is a fundamental component of the Superchain‚Äôs security model and thus we are requesting governance approval (as would, we believe, any decision to use the Security Council Safe to modify the DeputyGuardian).Note that the Guardian role is generally authorized to enforce ‚ÄòSafety over Liveness‚Äô in the system, meaning that it can currently pause and unpause withdrawals, and following the Fault Proofs upgrade will be able to intervene in the event that a bug would allow an invalid L2 output to be finalized.Reassigning the owner of the L2ProxyAdmin contract from the Foundation to the Security Council (currently in Phase 0, which is a joint 2/2 multisig between the Security Councils Safe and the Foundation Safe). This ensures the Security Council Safe has a blocking vote for L2 predeploy upgrades and is a requirement for Stage 1.If this vote passes, we recommend the upgrade be deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.SpecificationsThe full specifications for the Liveness Extension and Deputy Guardian system are availablefrom the specs repo.Technical DetailsThis upgrade does not affect the node or execution client software.The following outlines the full set of changes to the existing system:TheSecurityCouncilSafeis modified to:Increase its threshold from 4 to 10. The current owner count is 13 and will remain unchanged with this upgrade.Extend its functionality by enabling newLivenessModuleandLivenessGuardcontracts.This module and guard comprise a liveness checking mechanism intended to ensure that any loss of access to a signer‚Äôs keys is identified and addressed within a predictable period of time.The maximum time during which an owner will be considered live without having signed a transaction or else explicitly calling the guard to demonstrate liveness, will be3 months14 weeks. Should an owner not be live during that time, the Module will enable that owner to be removed without requiring a threshold of owners to sign. The duration of 14 weeks is chosen to be slightly longer than 3 months, so that liveness can be demonstrated on a regular quarterly cadence.In the unlikely event that enough owners are removed to reduce the total number of owners below 8, then the module will enable all owners to be removed and be replaced with the Foundation as the sole owner.A newGuardianSafeis deployed, which has a threshold of 1, and the Security Council Safe as its only owner.A newDeputyGuardianModuleis enabled on thisGuardianSafe. This module enables theFoundationSafeto call any of the Guardian authorized actions in theSuperchainConfigandOptimismPortalcontracts.This architecture will allow the Foundation to maintain the fast incident response system it has established, while providing the Security Council Safe with the ultimate authority to:override and reverse any Guardian actions taken by the Foundation.revoke the capacity to act as the Guardian by disabling theDeputyGuardianModule.TheSuperchainConfigcontract is upgraded with theGuardianSafein theGuardianrole (the code is unchanged).TheL2ProxyAdminOwneris set to thealiasedaddress of theL1ProxyAdminOwner, which is the Phase 0 Security Council.TheL1ProxyAdminOwner(i.e., the Phase 0 Security Council) can now sendbridging messagesfrom L1 to L2 to upgrade predeploy contracts on L2. This ensures the Security Council Safe has a blocking vote for L2 predeploy upgrades.TheL2ProxyAdminOwneris changed by callingtransferOwnership()onL2ProxyAdminwith the aliased address of the L1ProxyAdmin.These contracts are tagged in the optimism repo at commit9047beb(tagged as release candidateop-contracts/v1.5.0-rc.1).Security ConsiderationsCode SecurityConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, OP Labs had the code audited by aCantina contestwhich ended on May 10th. A Lead Security Researcher from Spearbit was also engaged to audit the system in parallel.This audit uncovered no High severity issues, however a number of improvements were identified which we elected to make in order to reduce the potential for issues resulting from human error. A draft of the report can be viewedhere. It will be finalized after the completion of judging and escalation, however OP Labs has reviewed the findings with assistance from the Cantina/Spearbit team and are confident that no High severity issues were identified.Those changes (all in theLivenessModule) are:A constructor check was removed, which enforced that the Safe‚Äôs threshold was greater than 75% of the owner count at the time of the module‚Äôs deployment. This check reduces the likelihood of the module being enabled on a misconfigured Safe, but also made the deployment and upgrade process more difficult. The check will instead be done at upgrade time, thus ensuring no loss of safety (PR here).Error message handling was modified to be more consistent with other portions of the codebase (PR here).The module will be deactivated in the event that ownership of the Security Council Safe is transferred to theFALLBACK_OWNER(the Foundation Safe). This mitigates the risk of unexpected behavior when the Safe is operating below the expected minimum number of owners (PR here).Operational SecurityWe will also establish monitoring systems for detecting events associated with the code. These systems will detect and alert on the following events:In theLivenessModuleWhen a signer on the Security Council Safe is no longer live and can be removed.When a signer is added or removed.When the fallback owner is activated.On the Security Council Safe:When either theLivenessModuleorLivenessGuardare removed or replaced.When any other module or guard is added or removed.On theDeputyGuardianModule:When any of the Guardian actions are taken using the module, including:Callingpause/unpauseon theSuperchainConfigcontract.CallingblacklistDisputeGame,setRespectedGameTypeon anOptimismPortalcontract.Proxy Admin Owner SecurityAccording to theStages framework, one of the requirements for Stage 1 is that ‚ÄúUsers‚Äô withdrawals cannot be censored by the permissioned operators‚Äù. This means that any vector to halt or censor users‚Äô withdrawals OR steal users‚Äô funds must be controlled by the Security Council.An attack vector exists whereby theL2ProxyAdminOwnercan potentially steal users‚Äô funds by upgrading L2 predeploy contracts. The specific attack is:Upgrade theL2toL1MessagePassercontract,Insert false entries to the[sentMessages()mapping](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/maur/guardian-module/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L24),One falsified withdrawal per asset is required to access the full balance of each ERC20 (in the Bridge) or ETH (in the Portal)Withdraw ERC20s from the Bridge and ETH from the PortalTo ensure ‚Äúno permissioned operators‚Äù can censor users‚Äô withdrawals or steal users‚Äô funds (and therefore satisfy Stage 1 requirements), theL2ProxyAdminOwneris being transferred from the Foundation Safe to the L2aliasof the Phase 0 Security Council. The Security Council Safe will now have a blocking vote on all L2 predeploy upgrades.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade. Node operators are not affected. Existing contracts retain their current interfaces in order to remain backward compatible with any existing integrations.These changes primarily affect the system of ownership and authorization, and serve to increase the decentralization of the Superchain.Action PlanIf this proposal passes a Token House vote, the L1 contracts will be upgraded following the completion of the Citizens‚Äô House Veto Period following Voting Cycle#23a. The upgrade will be completed atomically such that all affected L1 contracts will be upgraded within a single transaction.No action is required by node operators, as this is change affects contracts only.If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, OP Labs will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.ConclusionThis upgrade moves the Superchain forward in terms of decentralization, while preserving existing incident response capabilities and providing safety against potential liveness failures.","This proposal, from OP Labs, upgrades the Optimism Superchain to enhance security and decentralization.  Key changes include increasing the Security Council Safe's signing threshold to 10/13, reassigning the Guardian role to a new Safe controlled by the Security Council, and transferring L2ProxyAdmin ownership to the Security Council.  These actions address L2Beat's Stage 1 rollup requirements, mitigating risks of withdrawal censorship and fund theft.  A thorough audit revealed no high-severity issues.  The upgrade requires a Token House vote and will be deployed atomically after the veto period, with no downtime expected for node operators.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first Governance,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133,"Season 6: Introducing Blockspace Charters: Superchain-first GovernanceIn Season 6 of Optimism Governance, we intend introduce theBlockspace Charter: a new, technical-focused governing document (and framework) for the Superchain. This post will serve as an introduction to Blockspace Charters, explaining what they are and what their purpose is. We will also present, and eventually seek ratification for, the first charter‚ÄîtheStandard Rollup Charter‚Äîin a parallel post. An initial draft of the Standard Rollup Charter for community feedback can be foundhere.The Reflection Period will be used to build understanding of the underlying concepts presented below. Ratification for the Standard Rollup Charter will occur during Season 6, and updates to the corresponding Protocol Upgrade framework will follow. In the meantime, the Foundation will conduct an AMA as part of the Token House Community Call on Tuesday, May 14 to answer any questions and collect community feedback. Followup calls may be scheduled as necessary.MotivationThe Superchain is quickly blossoming into a robust ecosystem of OP Stack-based chains. However, these chains are not all technically equivalent:Different chains may use differentversionsof the OP Stack‚Äîsome projects have made modifications to the stack, and others are on outdated versions of it.Even within chains that are on the same version, some may beconfigureddifferently ‚Äî that is, deployed with different values for various parameters, admin roles, and so on.Open source, permissionless innovation is key to the Collective‚Äôs success. At the same time, ecosystem fragmentation also poses challenges:Users and developers need an easy way to understand what blockspace has which properties and guarantees.Optimism Governance needs to understand how to make decisions about these different forms of blockspace, which may make different commitments and have different control structures.The Law of Chainsis a neutrality framework designed to provide a guiding light for the Superchain and its stakeholders to make decisions and uphold protections. However, the Law of Chains is intentionally agnostic to any specific details of the protocol. This allows for it to beapplicable over many iterations of the protocol, but also means that it can fail to provide clear guidance at the granularity described in the above bullets.This makes the Law of Chains analogous to theWorking Constitution of the Optimism Collective. It defines the guiding principles for the Collective‚Äôs governance, but it does not define the specific mechanisms of voting cycles, quorums, and so forth.  Blockspace Charters are the equivalent to theOperating Manual, providing the specific implementation details for different types of Superchain blockspace.What is a Blockspace Charter?At a high level, a Blockspace Charter consists of three primary components:Criteria,Governing Policies, andPrecommitments.Criteriaare the specific technical parameters which define which chains are under the scope of a given charter.  The charter‚Äôs criteria should provide anobjective definitionfor which chains are under its scope.  Generally, there are two components to blockspace criteria:Version:The version of the OP Stack which the chain is using, as determined by commit-hash/release. This refers to the specific protocol code powering the blockspace.Configuration:the accepted range of parameterizations of the software in the OP Chain‚Äôs deployment. Configuration can include static variables defined at genesis, like the Chain ID, and dynamic variables, like the chain‚Äôs sequencer or upgrade keys. Configuration bounds state what values those options must fall within to satisfy the charter‚Äôs criteria.Solvency:This involves ensuring that a chain‚Äôs history does not include any invalid withdrawals, or invalid outputs, which could cause the bride to be undercollateralized.Governing Policiesare the specific rules, procedures, and principles which stakeholders participating in the charter‚Äôs blockspace follow.Generally, Governing Policies will be related to how the differentconfigured rolesshould behave or interact, and how that isenforced.  For example, if a charter‚Äôs blockspace criteria requires that upgrade keys configured be held by the Security Council, and allows the chain‚Äôs sequencer to be configured to be anybody, then the governing policies could define:The required behavior of the sequencer, which, if violated, would be grounds for removal, and the methods by which the community can check for violations.The governance process (i.e. proposal type) by which governance could vote to remove a sequencer found in violation.The signing procedure which would be subsequently taken by the Security Council to remove the offending sequencer.As you will see in theStandard Blockspace Charter draft, governing policies should be mapped back to theLaw of Chainsguiding principles.  For each protection in the Law of Chains, the governing policies make explicit how those protections can be upheld for the charter‚Äôs blockspace.Precommitmentsserve as a commitment mechanism, outlining anticipated changes (or anticipated consistency) for future upgrades to the charter.They are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the long-term vision and stability of the governance framework. By committing to specific parameters or outlining planned evolutions of the charter, Precommitments help mitigate uncertainty and foster a stable environment for growth and innovation within the Superchain ecosystem.Precommitments can address various critical aspects of OP chains, such asfee split models,role separations, andtechnical parameterslike gas limits and fee margins.The specificity of Precommitments can vary from extremely specific anticipated changes to protocol code, to anticipated changes to Governing Policies‚Äô enforcement procedures, to implementation-independent economic guidance or principles.How will Blockspace Charters be rolled out?Blockspace Charters will be rolled out alongside two supporting components: theSuperchain Registry, a Github repository which manages addition of new chains according to Charters‚Äô Criteria, and animproved upgrade proposal processwhich maps upgrade proposals to a particular Charter (seehere.)Superchain RegistryTheSuperchain Registrywill play a crucial role in the Blockspace Charter framework by serving as an accessible index of what chains are a part of the Superchain. It acts as the source of truth for which chains have been accepted under a specific charter and documents the specific configuration values which have been chosen for each chain. This registry is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability within the Superchain ecosystem.The Superchain Registry implements thevalidation logicreferenced in Charters‚Äô Criteria via an automated test suite. This ensures that all chains meet the criteria outlined in their respective Blockspace Charter before being added, ensuring consistency and security across the Superchain.As a public index, the Superchain Registry also serves asunified, accessible documentationfor what OP Chains exist, and what kind of blockspace they implement (i.e.‚Äîwhat charter, if any, they fall under). Note that the Superchain Registry may include different chains in the superchain which meet different charters‚Äô criteria (or which meet no charters‚Äô criteria). This means thatinclusion in the Superchain Registry only implies inclusion in the Superchain.The Superchain Registry implements an extensible categorization system to clearly delineate which chains fall under which criteria (and therefore which Blockspace Charter), which further implies what ‚Äúpart‚Äù of the Superchain it is in.Incremental Rollout (Beta Registry)While the process outlined in this document brings a great deal of clarity to Superchain governance, the Collective already votes on protocol versions independent of the chains in question. As the Security Council currently enacts all Protocol Upgrades, we do not view it as strictly necessary for the Standard Rollup Charter to be ratified before the Phase 1 Security Council becomes responsible for upgrades on additional OP Chains.Therefore, in close coordination with the Security Council and relevant Chain Governors and Servicers, we plan to roll out a ‚Äúbeta registry‚Äù and begin onboarding some initial chains to the Phase 1 Security Council and Superchain Registry, if we know they are on the governance-approved version of the OP Stack.  We plan to use this as an opportunity to iron out any frictions and get the Security Council comfortable with the end-to-end process, before before the charter is ratified and the process is scaled.Improved Upgrade Proposal ProcessCorresponding to Blockspace Charters being able to rigorously define specific types of blockspace, upgrade proposals will now be changed to correspond to specific charters. Together with the Superchain Registry, this will allow the Collective to clearly understand exactly which chains are in the scope of an upgrade, and rigorously consider the impact on stakeholders.The updated Upgrade Proposal template can be foundhere.  The template is relatively similar to that in previous seasons, with the difference that:Upgrade proposals now specify a Blockspace Charter to be upgraded.Upgrade proposals must link to a pull request for an updated charter. This will be the version of the charter that, if successful, applies post-upgrade.TheImpact Summarysection of the upgrade proposal now must provide:Justifications for all changes to the Blockspace Charter not covered in other sections.A comprehensive justification that all Precommitments in the previous Charter are preserved by the upgrade.This enhanced upgrade proposal process, by aligning closely with Blockspace Charters and the Superchain Registry, ensures a transparent, accountable, and stakeholder-focused approach to evolving the Superchain. It supports to goal that every upgrade is carefully considered, justified, and aligned with the long-term vision and commitments of the Optimism Collective, fostering a stable and innovative ecosystem.","Optimism's Season 6 governance introduces Blockspace Charters, technical governing documents for the Superchain's diverse OP Stack-based chains.  These charters, exemplified by the Standard Rollup Charter, define criteria (OP Stack version, configuration, solvency), governing policies, and precommitments for consistent upgrades.  A Superchain Registry will track compliant chains, ensuring transparency.  A beta registry will initially onboard chains, streamlining the process before full charter ratification.  Improved upgrade proposals will specify targeted charters, enhancing accountability and stakeholder focus within the evolving Superchain ecosystem.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Governor Update Proposal #1: Improve advanced delegation voting,https://gov.optimism.io/t/governor-update-proposal-1-improve-advanced-delegation-voting/7932,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend atvote.optimism.io. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This is a 1 line update to the governance smart contract of the token house that will allow the small subset of voters who have received their voting power from advanced delegation (a feature introduced in the last governor update) to vote by signing one transaction instead of two.If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.MotivationBackground:As part ofthe v2 upgrade of the token housewe shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called ‚Äúadvanced delegation‚Äù, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements. One side effect of feature is that voters who received advanced delegation would need to sign two transactions to vote.When we shipped this feature, we thought having two transactions would be a good thing, to easily show users when they voted from each of their voting powers: standard delegation power and advanced delegation power.After getting feedback from a small group of ~50 voters who‚Äôve received votes via this feature, it was clear that this was a bad idea. As a consequence, we have paused the further rollout of this feature and refactored the contract to allow for a vote with both standard and advanced delegation in one transaction.Impact to voters:Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience and will sign only 1 transaction.SpecificationsContract ChangedTheOptimism Governorwould be changed as part of this upgrade.

This upgrade enables Delegates with advanced voting power to sign only 1 transaction instead of 2 when voting.","This proposal, from Agora, the Optimism governance software provider, simplifies voting for users with ""advanced delegation"" voting power.  A recent Optimism upgrade introduced this feature, inadvertently requiring two transactions to vote.  This update merges these into one, improving user experience.  The change is minimal, audited by OpenZeppelin, and poses minimal risk.  Upon governance approval, the Optimism Foundation will upgrade the governor contract to the new implementation, deployed at 0x637DA4Eeac836188D8C46F63Cb2655f4d3C9F893.  No downtime is anticipated.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Upgrade Proposal #6: Multi-Chain Prep (MCP) L1,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-6-multi-chain-prep-mcp-l1/7677,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Diego, a protocol engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.This protocol upgrade strengthens the security and upgradeability of the Superchain by enabling L1 contracts to be upgraded atomically across multiple chains in a single transaction. To achieve this, this proposal transitions chain-specific deployment configuration from immutable variables into smart contract state. This allows multiple chains to point to a single smart contract implementation, which dramatically simplifies the deployment process and streamlines the upgrade process. This is particularly important for emergency upgrades, which would have previously required multiple upgrade transactions which increases the risk of exploitation in the event of a smart contract vulnerability.In addition, this upgrade extends the SystemConfig to contain the addresses of the contracts in the network. This improves developer experience by allowing users to discover the system‚Äôs contract addresses programmatically using SystemConfig.If this vote passes, we recommend the upgrade be deployed to OP Mainnet shortly after the end of the veto period. The newly-formed Security Council will be responsible for deploying this upgrade to OP Mainnet.SpecificationsContracts ChangedThe following contracts would be changed as part of this upgrade.

As such, we will not be modifying the contracts further in order to keep the contracts code-frozen. See the full audit reporthere. Additionally, given the low-severity nature of the issues and fixes, we decided not to pursue a fix review.Any fixes that did not require redeploying contracts have been made andmerged. Theremaining changes, which do not affect security, will be proposed as part of a future upgrade.We have also established monitoring systems for detecting events associated with initializations and upgrades of the contracts, the code of which you can findhere.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade. Node operators are not affected. Existing contracts retain their current interfaces in order to remain backward compatible with any existing integrations.The primary new functionality is the movement of variables out of immutable storage and into state. This is a change that will improve the upgradeability and incident response capacity of the Superchain.Action PlanIf approved by governance, the upgrade will be executed shortly after the veto period passes, pending coordination with the Security Council. The upgrade is code complete as of commite6ef3a900c42c8722e72c2e2314027f85d12ced5(releaseandtag) in the Optimism monorepo.This upgrade was successfully deployed toop-sepoliaon Jan 19, 2024.If a critical security issue is discovered before upgrading, OP Labs will collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade will no longer occur.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the Optimism Collective‚Äôs MCP L1 upgrade. This upgrade enables atomic, cross-chain upgrades and mitigates potential exploitation risks during emergency, multi-chain upgrades.As this is a contracts-only upgrade, no action is required by node operators.","This proposal, from OP Labs, upgrades the Optimism Superchain to improve security and upgradeability.  It moves chain-specific configuration from immutable variables to smart contract state, enabling atomic cross-chain upgrades via a single transaction. This simplifies deployments and streamlines emergency upgrades, reducing exploitation risks.  A security audit revealed only minor issues.  No downtime is anticipated, and node operators require no action.  Following governance approval and a veto period, the Security Council will deploy the upgrade, already successfully tested on op-sepolia.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Upgrade Proposal #5: Ecotone Network Upgrade,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-5-ecotone-network-upgrade/7669,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Roberto, an engineer on the core Base team and a core developer of the OP Stack. Neither Coinbase nor I represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions. Blobs are a new type of data storage introduced by Dencun specifically for the purpose of rollup data availability. Blob data is priced using a separate fee market from regular transaction gas, and is purely additive to calldata (batches in Ecotone can be posted using either). We expect a dramatic (up to ~80x) reduction in overall transaction fees due to the fact that blobs increase data availability capacity to 4x of what all L2s use today. The remaining changes in this upgrade bring the core improvements from the L1 Dencun hardfork into the OP stack, including new opcodes and the beacon root support. While blob data availability requires L1 Dencun activation, the Ecotone upgrade can be activated independently of it.SpecificationsTechnical SpecificationWe propose the Ecotone network upgrade which activates:EIP-4844 Blobs for Data AvailabilityChain derivation support for transaction batches posted to the L1 as EIP-4844 blobs. (spec)A new L1 data fee pricing function to accommodate the impact of blobs on data availability cost (spec).An upgraded GasPriceOracle L2 predeploy to compute it (spec)An upgraded L1Block predeploy to process the function‚Äôs new parameters provided by an updated L1 attributes transaction (spec)DencunEIP-4788: Expose beacon chain roots through the execution layer block header and EVM. (spec)EIP-1153: Transient storage opcode support (TLOAD, TSTORE).EIP-5656: Memory copy opcode support (MCODE).EIP-6780: Self-destruct (SELFDESTRUCT) limited to the same transaction only.EIP-4844is the only Dencun execution feature not activated in Ecotone. Blob transactions are instead explicitly disabled, and the BLOBBASEFEE opcode fromEIP-7516, while activated, always returns 1. (spec)The Ecotone hardfork activation block, which includes several transactions to perform all L2 contract deployments, upgrades, enablements, and proxy updates. (spec)Security ConsiderationsConsistent with theOP Labs Audit Framework, we did not have the contents of Ecotone audited; however Coinbase and OP Labs engineers did perform a security review of these changes.The Dencun upgrade consists of relatively standard EVM changes and the introduction of beacon block root in the block header and a beacon roots contract deployed at a special location. We consider the EVM changes low risk because they have been active on Goerli and Sepolia testnets without issue. We have also entirely disabled the new transaction type (blob transactions) introduced by EIP-4844 from being accepted by the L2 chain.While blobs are disabled in the L2, Ecotone supports posting transaction batches to the L1 using blobs. This extension affects chain derivation, adding new logic around interpreting blob transactions posted by the batcher, downloading any referenced blobs from an L1 consensus client, and processing their contents by decoding them from the blob format to the usual channel format. We consider these changes medium risk primarily because of the larger scope of the change. These changes do not affect bridging or any L1 contracts, and are therefore unlikely to introduce bugs that can be exploited to drain assets.The introduction of the new L1 data fee cost function required updates to two of the L2 predeploy contracts, GasPriceOracle and L1Block, and also changes to both op-node and op-geth to compute the fee values and propagate the appropriate fee parameters. The contract extensions were required to pass the new Blob base fee derived from L1 blocks to the L2 so that it is aware of the blob fee market, and so that developers could use the GasPriceOracle to compute the new data fee without having to roll their own implementation of the new function (details here). These changes are limited to a few short functions. Because of the overall scope of this change, we consider it medium risk. The most severe faults from these changes might be a chain halt due to a chain derivation/validation failure, or under/over payment for L1 data fees by users. Significant underpayment could result in revenue loss for the chain operator, but the system provides parameters that can be updated quickly via the SystemConfig in order to quickly compensate for such scenarios.One final potential risk is the introduction of a special Ecotone upgrade block which introduces special deposit transactions that perform the various contract deployments and upgrades on the L2. Bugs in this code could lead to an incomplete fork with missing contracts or contract functionality expected by the upgrade, in the worst case leading to chain halt. We have tested the upgrade process on several devnets and the Base and OP-goerli testnets with success, and overall consider the changes medium risk.Impact SummaryWe do not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade.Bringing Dencun to the OP Stack is important to retain compatibility with Ethereum. One Dencun change to be aware of is the new behavior of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, which may be backwards incompatible for some contracts. We expect the number of affected contracts to be small since the change has been long telegraphed by L1 developers. The beacon root feature introduced by Dencun will allow L2 contracts to validate L1 consensus data, and should support new use cases involving staking pools and re-staking.We expect the greatest impact of Ecotone to come from using blobs for transaction batching. Blobs are a new type of L1 data storage introduced by Dencun specifically for the purpose of rollup data availability. Blob data is priced using a separate fee market from regular transaction gas, and is purely additive to calldata (batches in Ecotone can be posted using either). It‚Äôs difficult to precisely estimate the impact of this feature on transaction fees since we cannot predict new use cases that might arise to consume them. Based on the data availability use case alone, however, capacity increases to 4x what all L2s are using today. While blobspace is uncongested, we expect up to ~80x reduction in fees for all OP chains as long as blobs are fully utilized. Prediction markets are currently estimating a 40x cost reduction in the short term.Blob usage is optional and configurable by the chain operator in Ecotone. Lower traffic chains may choose not to enable them since achieving maximum benefits may require far less frequent posting of data to the L1. While blob usage requires Dencun activation on the L1, Ecotone can be activated independently of it should the benefits of its other features be desired earlier.Action PlanIf this vote passes, the Ecotone upgrade will be scheduled for execution on March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC**. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Ecotone is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit f707883038d527cbf1e9f8ea513fe33255deadbc  and op-geth at commit 0402d543c3d0cff3a3d344c0f4f83809edb44f10. The op-node release v1.7.0 and op-geth release v1.101308.2 contain these changes.*In the event governance vetoes the upgrade, we will release a new version of the op-node and op-geth software with the activation date removed.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets in coordination with Base & Conduit. It successfully activated on op-goerli and base-goerli on Feb 6, with Sepolia scheduled for Feb 21.If there is a critical security issue, node operators will be able to disable the upgrade by using the --override.ecotone flag on both op-node & op-geth. Coinbase and OP Labs will also collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade is no longer happening.We will release a new version of op-node & op-geth with the mainnet Ecotone activation date baked in and publicize to node operators & end users that the Ecotone upgrade will be occurring. The mainnet ecotone activation date is scheduled for March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the network upgrade after Delta titled Ecotone. This network upgrade maintains EVM equivalence via activating the Dencun network upgrade and allows OP Stack to take advantage of L1 blob data for lower cost data availability.We expect that this upgrade will not result in any down time and will occur on March 14th.*This proposal was updated to reference op-node v1.7.0.**A previous revision proposed an upgrade date of March 18th 17:00:00 UTC.","The Ecotone network upgrade for the OP Stack, proposed by Coinbase engineer Roberto, leverages EIP-4844 blobs for dramatically reduced transaction fees (up to 80x), increasing data availability capacity fourfold.  It incorporates Dencun L1 improvements, including new opcodes and beacon root support, while maintaining EVM equivalence.  Blob transactions are initially disabled on L2 for safety, though the system supports posting batches to L1 using blobs.  A security review was conducted, and the upgrade, scheduled for March 14th, is anticipated to be seamless.  While blob usage is optional, its full utilization promises significant cost reductions.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Upgrade Proposal #4,https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-4/7534,"Hi I‚Äôm Maurelian, an engineer at OP Labs.OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem, and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of the Optimism Foundation.This is the fourth proposed network upgrade after Bedrock. It introduces a new L1 contract, theSuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.Executive SummaryThis protocol upgrade would not only strengthens individual chains, but leverages the collective security intelligence of the entire Superchain ecosystem. The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit856c08b(taggedas release candidateop-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).Technical SpecificationThis is a security focused upgrade. It is limited to the L1 smart contracts, and does not affect the node or execution client software.The following changes are being introduced with the upgrade:A newSuperchainConfigcontract and improvements to the pausability mechanism providing stronger protection for assets held in the bridge.See theSuperchainConfigspecificationTheOptimismPortalandL1CrossDomainMessengerare updated to fix an issue (which would only occur during an upgrade), resulting in some values being unnecessarily reset to their defaults after an upgrade.PR hereThe L1OptimismMintableERC20TokenFactoryis being updated with two improvements:Support for deploying a token with a custom number of decimals (PR hereandhere).UsingCREATE2to ensure that tokens with different properties do not have the same addresses on different OP Chains. (PRshereandhere).Security ConsiderationsThis upgrade has been audited by Trust Security, the final report can befound here.Summary of the audit findingsThe audit did not identify any security issues in the system‚Äôsnewly addedfunctionality.The audit did however identify an issue in the system‚Äôs existing upgrade path. The affected contracts werefixedand upgraded on the Sepolia testnet.Importantly, the issue could only be exploited if the upgrade was performed in a specific way. In such a case, an attacker could have intercepted the upgrade transaction, to perform a one-time double withdrawal of ETH held in theL1CrossDomainMessenger. Note that this contract currently holdszero ETHat the time of writing. Under normal circumstances, the vast majority of ETH is stored in theOptimismPortal.Please see TRST-H-1 in theaudit reportfor a detailed discussion of the issue.This issue is only exploitable during an upgrade, and the upgrade scripts have been fixed, so no future upgrades will be at risk of this issue.No other findings from the audit presented a risk of a loss of assets.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade, and node operators are not affected.Existing contracts retain their current interfaces in order to remain backwards compatible with any existing integrations.The primary new functionality will be an extension of the pause mechanism, which prevents the withdrawal of assets from the system in the event that a vulnerability is identified. This will improve the incident response capacity of OP Labs.Currently only theOptimismPortal‚ÄôsproveWithdrawalTransaction()andfinalizeWithdrawalTransaction()functions are pausable.Following this upgrade, this will expand to include the following additional functions:L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage()L1StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeERC20()L1StandardBridge.finalizeERC20WithdrawalL1tandardBridge.finalizeBridgeETH()L1StandardBridge.finalizeETHWithdrawalL1ERC721Bridge.finalizeBridgeERC721()Prior to the upgrade, a new proxy (at the addresshere) and implementation (at0x53c165169401764778f780a69701385eb0ff19b7) for theSuperchainConfig(version1.1.0) has been deployed and initialized.The upgrade will also result in the following changes to the internal state of the existing L1 contracts, with the implementations corresponding to the addresseslisted here.Summary of these changes:TheL1CrossDomainMessengerwill be upgraded to version2.2.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.TheL1ERC721Bridgecontract will be upgraded to version2.0.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.TheL1StandardBridgecontract will be upgraded to version2.0.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.TheOptimismPortalcontract will be upgraded to version2.1.0, and a new storage variablesuperchainConfigwill hold the address of theSuperchainConfigproxy contract.5. TheSystemConfigcontract will be upgraded to version1.11.0.6. TheL2OutputOraclecontract will be upgraded to version1.7.0.TheOptimismMintableERC20Factorycontract will be upgraded to version1.8.0.All L1 contracts have also had modifications to the source code formatting (white space and comment-style) which do not otherwise affect their behavior.Action PlanIf this proposal passes a Token House vote, the L1 contracts will be upgraded following the completion of the Citizens‚Äô House Cycle#18Veto Period. The upgrade will be completed atomically such that all affected L1 contracts will be upgraded within a single transaction.As this is a contracts-only upgrade, no action is required by node operators.","OP Labs proposes a security-focused upgrade to the Optimism network's L1 contracts, enhancing the pause mechanism for improved incident response.  This fourth post-Bedrock upgrade introduces a new `SuperchainConfig` contract and strengthens protection across the Superchain ecosystem, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and token withdrawals.  A Trust Security audit revealed a fixable vulnerability exploitable only during upgrades; this has been addressed.  The upgrade, affecting several L1 contracts (including the `OptimismPortal`, `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, and bridges), requires no node operator action and anticipates no downtime.  Backwards compatibility is maintained.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,[FINAL] Upgrade Proposal #3: Delta Network Upgrade,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-upgrade-proposal-3-delta-network-upgrade/7310,"Executive SummaryTest in Prod proposes Delta network upgrade, which activates Span Batches for OP Mainnet and all other OP Chains.Span Batches implement a new batching specification that reduces L1 costs by~97% for inactive chains(165 ETH ‚Üí 5 ETH).We expect Span Batches to derisk launching new OP Chains by meaningfully reducing L1 costs for inactive chains.Hello! This is Test in Prod, one of thecore development teamsof Optimism Collective.This is a proposal for the Delta network upgrade, which activatesSpan Batches. Span Batches is a new batching spec from Test in Prod, building upon initial designs by Protolambda.Span Batches removes the overhead of the current batching specs by encoding consecutive L2 blocks into one batch. This leads to reducing L1 costs by~97% for inactive chains, and6%~11% for performant chainslike OP Mainnet or Base Mainnet based on ourbacktesting results.Span Batches will support the adoption of the OP Stack by meaningfully reducing L1 costs for OP Chains, therefore reducing the risks of launching new L2s with the OP Stack.Technical SummarySpecificationThis upgrade (‚ÄúDelta‚Äù) contains a single consensus-layer feature, Span Batches. Please refer to the following documents for the technical information on Span Batches:Design DocsSpec DocsGithub Issue TrackerResearch Repository(includes backtesting results & code for various OP Chains)Security ConsiderationsThe Span Batch is a consensus-critical feature. It is not required to undergo a security audit according to theOP Labs Audit Framework; Span Batches impacts liveness & reputational quadrant, instead of existential & safety parts in the rubrics of the Audit Framework‚Äîspecifically derivation aside from deposits and batching. The Audit Framework doesn‚Äôt suggest audits in the liveness & reputational quadrant, but rather testing via progressive real-world usage.The Span Batch doesn‚Äôt have changes on the state transitions, so there is no possibility that users‚Äô states can change in an unintended way. In the worst case, some transactions could be omitted.Therefore, Test in Prod went through the following steps to ensure the safety of this proposal, focusing on the liveness parts:1) Security review with OP LabsTest in Prod passed a security review with OP Labs. Since the Delta upgrade isn‚Äôt related to user assets, but instead implements a consensus upgrade, we focused on reviewing cases where the consensus could fail and built contingency plans for the failure. Please refer to theContingency Planssection in the current proposal for detailed contingency plans.Throughout the review, we figured that the Span Batch deployment would be less likely to impact Sequencer‚Äôs pre-confirming block production‚Äîthe unsafe head progression; we expect end users to be less likely to be impacted in the majority of failure scenarios.2) Ran verification script on Superchain Devnet & TestnetsTest in Prod prepared theverification scriptfor Span Batches. The script checks the entire consensus process from posting batches on L1 to deriving L2 blocks from L1. It tests if there‚Äôs a consensus failure by detecting unsafe reorgs‚Äîensuring nodes derive the same state that the Sequencer originally calculated before posting batches. Please refer to theFunctionality Verification Guidefor more details.The verification script works as follows:Send various types of transactions to the L2.Record the transactions‚Äô hashes & included unsafe blocks‚Äô hashes.Poll if the included blocks areconsolidated to safe.Compare recorded unsafe blocks‚Äô hashes to safe blocks that include transactions.If same, it‚Äôs a success!3) E2E tests & unit testsTest in Prod prepared the e2e tests & unit tests for Span Batches. They cover a wide range of scenarios and check if the code operates as intended. Here are Github PRs for e2e tests:#1#2#3Impact SummaryPerformance ImpactSpan Batch saves more L1 fees than the current state of the OP Stack, and savings increase the less active the chain is. Therefore, Test in Prod expects more savings on L1 fees for less-active chains; we expect to save L1 feesby ~97% for low-throughput chainsand6%~11% for high-throughput chainslike OP Mainnet or Base Mainnet.Test in Prod backtested several OP Chains and prepared the expected L1 fee savings in %. Please refer to theExpected Result section in the Design Docsfor the result.User ImpactDelta doesn‚Äôt include any direct impact on the users‚Äô side. Also, Test in Prod doesn‚Äôt expect downtime for the Delta upgrade.Node ImpactNodes will be unable to syncthe chain if nodes don‚Äôt perform the software update until the op-batcher operator starts posting Span Batches. Thus,nodes are required to update software versionsto keep in sync with the OP Chains.Please refer to theGuides for Nodessection in the current proposal for the upgrade details.Upgrade DetailsAfter Delta hard fork, Span Batches submission won‚Äôt be activated automatically; the op-batcher operators should restart their instance with the Span Batches enabled. Therefore, even though Delta hard fork time passes, nothing will happen until the op-batcher operator explicitly starts posting batches in the Span Batch.OP Chains can use (post & derive) both Singular Batches and Span Batches after the Delta hard fork.Action PlansTimeline (including finished items)Test in Prod proposes 00:00:00 Feb 22, 2024, UTC for the Delta hard fork time‚Äî1707922800 in Unix Timestamp. It‚Äôs three weeks after Voting Cycle#17ends, and two weeks after the Citizens‚Äô House veto period.The Delta upgrade has already been activated on op-goerli, op-sepolia, base-goerli, base-sepolia, pgn-sepolia, zora-sepolia, and Superchain Devnet (operated by OP Labs, Base, and Conduit).Here‚Äôs the list of the timeline for Delta including finished items:Superchain Devnet activation at 00:00:00, Dec 08, 2023 UTC.Goerli Testnets activation at 00:00:00, Dec 21, 2023 UTC.Sepolia Testnets activation at 00:00:00, Dec 22, 2023 UTC.Voting results are final & start to notify upgrading nodes at 19:00:00, Jan 31, 2024 UTC.Including the one-week veto period.(Proposed) Mainnet activation at 00:00:00, Feb 22, 2024 UTC.Appended one week due to the veto period.Contingency PlansOur contingency plans for the unexpected failure of the Delta upgrade are as follows: op-batcher disables posting Span Batches, start posting legacy batches (Singular Batches), prepare the fix, and enable Span Batches again. In this way, we expect the impact on the user side will be minimized while resolving the issues‚Äîthe sequencer would continue pre-confirming blocks as normal, but batch submission would be halted until the op-batcher restarts to push Singular Batches.However, if there‚Äôs an unexpected critical issue where we need nodes‚Äô action, we have prepared a way for nodes to disable the upgrade by using--override.deltaflag on op-node. Test in Prod will work with OP Labs to monitor, communicate, and alert relevant parties upon the upgrade in such cases.Software versionsThe code for the Delta upgrade is ready in the following Optimism monorepo hash:54a7dbf8aa9b982f9c6a54cbbe448be41c0b7bc7.Nodes can manually set the Delta hard fork time with the preceding code. However, nodes will not automatically activate Delta on Mainnet as the Delta hard fork time is not embedded in the code; it cannot be embedded since Delta has not yet been approved by governance.If the governance approves the Delta hard fork and finalizes the hard fork time, Test in Prod will work with OP Labs to prepare the new release that embeds the Mainnet hard fork time and notify the community. With the new release, nodes won‚Äôt have to manually set the Delta hard fork time; but they will automatically activate the Delta upgrade.The following versions are deployed in the testnets:op-node: v1.4.1op-batcher: v1.4.1op-proposer: v1.4.1op-geth: v1.101304.2Guides for Node OperatorsNode operators are required to upgrade the software versions. Please refer to the following guides:Delta Upgrade Guide in Optimism DocsDelta Node Upgrade Guide(For op-batcher operators)Delta Hard Fork Functionality Verification GuideConclusionThis proposal outlines the Delta upgrade that includes Span Batches. This upgrade reduces the size overheads of the current specs in a significant step for less-active chains, and it leads to alleviating the risks of launching new OP Stack L2s.By reducing the L1 fees and risks with the Delta upgrade, we expect to alleviate burdens for less-active chains, help easier adoptions of the OP Stack, and head one step forward to the Superchain future.We don‚Äôt expect sequencer downtime for the Delta hard fork & activating Span Batches.",Summary not available
Technical  Proposals üìÉ,[Temp Check] Burn surplus RetroPGF (+ monetary policy proposals),https://gov.optimism.io/t/temp-check-burn-surplus-retropgf-monetary-policy-proposals/7307,"Currently, there‚Äôs no monetary policy proposal type. So, this is not a proposal, but rather a conversation starter about some serious issues.This has been completely centralized, as decided by Optimism Foundation. The projections offered at genesis have not been honoured, andcurrent projectionsare also vague. Confidence in tokens or anything of economic value is derived from predictability and stability - which has been completely undermined in the name of experimentation. There‚Äôs billions of dollars at play here, we need to take things more seriously. The entire handling of $OP distribution has been haphazard. I believe $OP can do better with decentralized community checks and balances, and thus there should be monetary policy proposal types.While there are many errors and problems with the policy, the most obvious issue is - the RetroPGF allocation.I‚Äôve discussed burning it in the past, so let‚Äôs revisit that topic. As per initial projections announced at genesis, 100% of the RetroPGF (along with Ecosystem Fund) was intended to be allocated by the end of Year 4:image1920√ó914 97 KBHowever, after nearly 2 years in, only 40 million, or ~4.7% would have been distributed.Current projectionsare radically different [please see Erratum below, the next figures are wrong], calling for only 140 million OP to be distributed by the end of year 5. This is only 16% of the initial projections, despite the 1 extra year. To be clear, this is a more reasonable projection than the ones initially offered, but that leaves a massive overhang of 700 million $OP tokens. At the end of 5 years, over ~75% of pending unlock (effectively inflation) will be RPGF alone.It‚Äôs obvious that RPGF was severely overallocated at genesis, and >6x gap between initial projections and current projections reflects the magnitude of the error. My recommendation is to burn the ~700 million OP that was overallocated to RPGF, while honouring the current projections till year 5.[Erratum: As@danftzpoints out below, it‚Äôs actually 340 million OP per the projections, with the overhang being ~500M OP, not ~700M OP. I‚Äôd prefer to see 140M OP be distributed, as that‚Äôs plenty for RPGF.]To be clear, this does not mean the end of RPGF at the end of year 5. 5 years in for the OP Collective, and nearly a decade in for the Optimism Foundation and its predecessor Plasma Group at large, it‚Äôs about time to consolidate and become economically sustainable. Beyond that point, a ~75% overhang is unjustified. So, RPGF will continue, but in a different form, that‚Äôs sustainable:Share of protocol revenues (sequencer, MEV, OP stack chains etc.)Share of regular inflation (currently 0%, but we can bump it to 1% or 2% after year 5)This will lead to:A more sustainable RPGFClarity in the massive RPGF overhang, leading to increase confidence and long-term value in the $OP token, leading to higher economic security and sustainabilityIncrease in net value of $OP tokens by ~16% due to the lower supplyThese are just my thoughts, please voice your opinion below.PS: I‚Äôve changed the title to ‚ÄúBurn surplus RetroPGF‚Äù from ‚ÄúBurn RetroPGF‚Äù","Optimism's RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) allocation is drastically underperforming initial projections, leaving a massive 500 million OP token overhang.  This lack of transparency and predictability undermines confidence in the $OP token.  The author proposes burning this surplus to increase $OP's value by ~16%, creating a more sustainable RPGF model funded by protocol revenues and a small inflation rate (1-2%) after year 5.  This action aims to improve economic stability and long-term token value, addressing a critical issue impacting billions of dollars.  The author emphasizes the need for decentralized community oversight and monetary policy proposals within the Optimism ecosystem.

Technical  Proposals üìÉ,Security Council: Vote #1 - Change to Security Model,https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-vote-1-change-to-security-model/6886,"For full context on the implementation of the Security Council, please readIntro to Optimism‚Äôs Security CouncilSecurity Council: Vote#1- Change to Security ModelThe proposal that follows requests Token House approval for a change to the security model of OP Mainnet. This change does not constitute a Protocol Upgrade.SummaryThis is a proposal to turn proxy admin keys for OP Mainnet over to a public, decentralized set of individual actors (‚Äúparticipants‚Äù) accountable to Optimism Governance: i.e., theSecurity Council.Specifically, for this initial Security Council proposal (Vote # 1), Governance will vote to approve the addition of the Security Council as one signer (of two) on a 2/2 multisig that controls protocol upgrades for OP Mainnet. The other signer on the multisig will be the current Foundation multisig.If this proposal passes, it will approve a change similar tothis illustrative example.There will be an on-chain change of the ProxyAdmin‚Äôs owner from0x9ba6e03d8b90de867373db8cf1a58d2f7f006b3ato a new 2 of 2 multisig (0xdc53b1d440b8a56dd50a6d69312dac903d3aa48b, in the example provided above).The state diff for the above example can be foundhere.Security ConsiderationsThe Security Council will operate a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet.Participants will carry out their roles in accordance with theCharterincluding the following key points:Duringnormal operations, the Security Council will implement the protocol upgrade and role designation decisions (such as designations for the sequencer, proposer, and challenger roles, as well as designating the composition of the participants on the Security Council multisig) made by Optimism Governance. The Security Council simply does as Governance directs. It does not directly evaluate the ‚Äúmerit‚Äù of the accompanying proposed code (e.g., for security purposes); that evaluation is the responsibility of Governance.During definedemergency situations, the Security Council is empowered to act preemptively, without direct Governance approval, in order to keep the network safe and secure. Each participant may also take actions they or the Optimism Foundation believes to be necessary to comply with applicable law.Dysfunctional participants, either individually or acting as a quorum, can be effectively checked, without undermining the security advantages motivating the formation of the Council in the first place.ConclusionYou can read the complete Security Council Charterhere. Technically, neither the existence of a Security Council nor its Charter needs to be approved via governance. However, since the implementation of this proposedSecurity Councilrepresents a fundamental change to OP Mainnet‚Äôs security model, the Optimism Foundation is requesting approval to implement the change.If this proposal passes with a 76% approval threshold (30% quorum), the Optimism Foundation will move forward with the implementation of theSecurity Council.Note:Through subsequent Governance proposals and votes, it is intended that this Security Council will eventually extend beyond OP Mainnet, to secure all other OP Chains within the Superchain (read more). The ultimate goal is preventing any single party from being able to upgrade the system, modify rollup state, or censor transactions.What Does this Mean for Delegates?This proposal will go to a vote in Special Voting Cycle#16a.",Summary not available
Technical  Proposals üìÉ,[FINAL] Upgrade Proposal #2: Canyon Network Upgrade,https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-upgrade-proposal-2-canyon-network-upgrade/7088,"Executive SummaryHi I‚Äôm Joshua, an engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem, and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.Upgrade#2, Canyon is the first proposed network upgrade after Bedrock. Canyon contains the Shapella network upgrade from Ethereum, a change to reduce the volatility of the basefee, and several minor bug fixes. The Canyon upgrade will maintain EVM equivalence & improve the ergonomics of using the OP Stack for developers and end users. In addition, node operators will need to upgrade their nodes to stay in sync. Canyon brings the OP Stack protocol version to v4.0.0.If this vote passes, Canyon will activate onop-mainnet,base-mainnet,pgn-mainnet, &zora-mainnetonThu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024(Unix Time1704992401)  barring a critical security issue.

OP Labs considers the EVM changes low risk because they have been active on L1 without issue. Withdrawals are a new L1 codepath to create arbitrary mints in the EVM. OP Labs has ensured that this type of transaction cannot occur on L2‚Ä¶The next set of changes, EIP-1559 config change, the channel ordering change, and the receipt hash change also are low risk changes. They do not modify any code path which is responsible for securing user funds and have been tested.The last change, the create2Deployer, presents a larger user facing change. Canyon unconditionally modifies the bytecode of the0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2address. This address already has the create2Deployer on it on some, but not all, networks. OP Labs has validated that the contract code deployed by Canyon matches the public ABI of the existing contract. This upgrade does remove portions of the admin ABI (pausing, ownable), but OP Labs has confirmed that the contract author is ok with removing the Ownable & Pausable functionality. A typical developer would not be able to call these functions.Impact SummaryOP Labs does not anticipate any down time due to this upgrade. This network upgrade does not contain backwards incompatible changes for end users.Shapella is important to retain compatibility with Ethereum. One change to be aware of is the deprecationwarningof the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. The behavior of the opcode is not changing in Canyon, but is expected to change in a future network upgrade. Ethereum is expected to implementEIP-6780in the Dencun network upgrade to modify this opcode, and the Optimism community should expect to follow this change in the spirit of EVM equivalence.The EIP-1559 Denominator will be changing from 50 to 250. OP Labs is proposing this change to decrease volatility in the basefee on the OP Stack. By increasing the denominator, the amount the basefee increases is reduced when the gas used is over the gas target. A denominator of 50 was initially chosen for Bedrock such that the basefee on the OP Stack would decrease at approximately a rate of -12% per 12s when the block were completely empty. This matches the decrease of Ethereum‚Äôs basefee. The rate of increase with completely full blocks was 77% over 12s because the gas limit on the OP Stack is 6x the gas target. Since Bedrock, 2 minutes of full congestion (30m gas blocks) on the OP Stack would result in an increased base fee of ****304x ****(1.1^60) ******vs 2 minutes of full congestion on L1 Ethereum would result in an increased base fee of3.24x(1.125^10). OP Labs is suggesting a denominator of 250 to match the rate of increase of Ethereum when OP Stack blocks are completely full. This will also reduce how quickly the basefee decays when blocks are empty and will enable users to have their transactions included more easily during periods of high usage.Canyon modifies the protocol to handle unclosed channels. Previously, only a single channel could be active at a time and if the channel was not closed, it would need to time out before progress could resume. Following the upgrade, the op-node will read the first channel that is ready.A new field will be added to the deposit transaction receipt encoding. It modifies the encoding to fix a bug where the deposit transaction nonce was not in consensus encoding.Finally, Canyon sets the create2Deployer bytecode at0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2on all OP networks. This enables developers to have access to this commonly used contract on all OP networks, not just OP Mainnet. This also particularly helps users on Base mainnet, where, due to a deployment issue, the create2Deployer is not able to be deployed to this address. Block explorers may have to re-verify the create2Deployer contract.Action PlanIf this vote passes, the Canyon upgrade will be schedule for execution 5 ****weeks after the vote passes, onThu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024.The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Canyon is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit6cce3728b7bed5e36234aeba3b773e0f97867be3and op-geth at commited8e9f54ed0a5069e77ea34895ff12a9ac4ca17f. The op-node release v1.3.1 and op-geth release v1.101304.1 contain these changes. These commits do not contain the Canyon timestamp for mainnet. These releases could be used on mainnet by using the--override.canyonflag. OP Labs will release a future version of op-node & op-geth with the Canyon time configured if governance approves this upgrade.This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets in coordination with Base & Conduit. It successfully activated onop-goerli,op-sepolia,base-goerli,base-sepolia,pgn-sepolia, &zora-sepoliaon November 14 at 17:00:00 UTC.If there is a critical security issue, node operators will be able to disable the upgrade by using the‚Äîoverride.canyonflag on both op-node & op-geth. OP Labs will also collaborate with the community to extensively communicate that the upgrade is no longer happening.OP Labs will release a new version of op-node & op-geth with the Canyon activation date baked in and publicize to node operators & end users that the Canyon upgrade will be occurring.ConclusionThis proposal outlines the Optimism Collective‚Äôs first network upgrade after Bedrock titled Canyon. This network upgrade maintains EVM equivalence via activating the Shapella network upgrade and includes several OP Stack specific improvements.We expect that this upgrade will not result in any down time and will occur atThu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024.",Summary not available

This inflation takes place via theMintManagercontract calling themint()function on the OP token contract at0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042.This inflation parameter can be adjusted by Optimism Collective Governance. While the Citizens‚Äô House is still in early stages, inflation adjustment will be determined via vote from the Token House, as specified in theOperating Manual.Note that this may not be the final governance process for inflation; the system may evolve as additional governance rights and capabilities come online.Inflation accrues to the ‚ÄúUnallocated‚Äù portion of the OP token allocations.

Policies  and Templates üìå,Season 7: Collective Reward Framework,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-collective-reward-framework/8112,"Special thanks to@Alisha,@brichis,@ceresstation,@GFXlabs,@Gonna.eth, and@teresacdfor feedback and suggestions on the Season 6 version of the framework as part of theFeedback CommissionSeason 7: Collective Rewards FrameworkWhat is this Framework For?As governance contributions across the Token House and Citizens‚Äô House are rewarded, it‚Äôs important to have a framework to set rewards consistently across the Collective. To this end, the below non-binding, guidelines provide a suggested framework to think about Collective rewards, and are not meant to serve as a rigid or binding policy encapsulating all possible scenarios.The primary use case will be in the Token House‚Äôs evaluation of prospective Governance Fund budgets and to ensure more consistency and predictability for voter rewards (delivered retroactively at the end of each Season, based on governance participation.)How will this Framework Evolve?This suggested framework is a step towards transitioning more allocation decision making to the community. In the future, we may introduce a Budget Board to make recommendations to the Collective about allocation parameters. The Budget Board may use these guidelines as a starting point from which they propose a rewards framework or policy to be ratified by governance. Our recommendation is that any future policy be kept as streamlined as possible. The more complexity and/ or the more variables involved, the more difficult forecasting and budgeting will be for the Collective in the future.General GuidelinesDistributing rewards retroactively solves many of the compensation and budgeting problems prevalent in other DAOs. However, until the Retro Funding mechanism is reliable enough to support more contributions, we recommend setting Governance Fund budgets without the expectation of receiving Retro Funding.All rewards are entirely in OP.Foundation and Governance Fund Mission grants are locked for one year, unless supporting user incentives (full detailshere.)Stipends for elected representatives are distributed periodically throughout the Season and are unlocked.All retroactivegovernance participation rewardsare unlocked.Guidelines by Contribution TypeThere are several different types of contributions to the CollectiveAd hoc:These contributions are open to anyone!These contributions may include research and analysis, hosting community calls, and/orBuilder IdeasThese contributions are best suited to be rewarded via retroactive governance participation rewards.Contribution Paths:These contributions are open to anyone who has completed all steps in the pre-defined path (notelected)All the NERD programs and the Ambassadors are contribution pathsContribution paths are led by ‚ÄúMaintainers,‚Äù which are similar to ‚ÄúLeads‚Äù on Councils, and may be supported initially by Foundation Missions.Representatives:Elected contributors that act as representatives. Please note that most contributors should not be elected, (seeDAO Design Principles.)Representatives currently serve on Council or Boards that are established via theCollective Representative Frameworkas part of higher level system design that suggests the Collective can only support 4-5 of these bodies and ~50 representatives.Elected representatives currently receive stipends from the Governance Fund. Stipends should correspond to Impact Ratings.Governance participantsHighly engaged governance participants receive retroactive participation rewards.Rewards should correspond to Impact Ratings.This comes out of the Unallocated portion of the token supply right now, but will need to be supported by the Governance Fund eventually.Service ProvidersThe Collective intentionally does not support persistent working groups staffed with full time DAO contributors, instead supporting autonomous Service Providers via Missions.OP Labs and other Core Devs (Sunnyside Labs, Agora, etc.) can be thought of as Service Providers, as can other Mission Applicants.Service Providers may be supported by Foundation, Governance Fund, or Retro Funding Missions.p0 Service Providers may also be supported by private RetroPGF backstop grantsImpact Rating FrameworkThis rewards framework is based on the concept of Impact Ratings. Impact Ratings are conceptual, to be used as a non-binding guide in determining budgets or rewards for various contributions.This framework does not imply rewards will or should be made for all contributions that fall under an Impact Rating. Conversely, contributions that fall outside these examples may still be rewarded. Governance participants should use this framework to reason about which rating a given contribution would fall under and/or whether a given contributor should receive above/below the amount suggested by the corresponding Impact Rating (ie. leadership positions on a Council.) Impact Ratings will not be officially assigned or tracked as they are merely a decision making tool for the community to better assess budget requests and understand voter rewards.Why Impact Ratings?It is a design principle of the Collective to focus on outputs (impact) rather than inputs (amount of work) and we believe this approach should be reflected in a Collective Reward Framework. This framework also allows for the flexibility required to be adaptive over time while preserving the integrity of OP as a governance token (1 OP = 1 OP.) Given the need to be adaptive and the Collective‚Äôs approach to iteration and learning, each Season, the amount of OP suggested for each Impact Rating will be adjusted, and ratified, as appropriate.Below are the suggested Impact Ratings for Season 6. Suggested rewards are on a per contributor basis.Impact 1=Contributes to theaccessibilityof the Collective; no specialized skills or context neededEngaging in behaviors that promoteCollective Values, such as disclosing conflicts of interest, promoting long term decision making, or empowering community members to make better decisions.Suggested Season 6 Rewards: 250 OP per SeasonImpact 2=Contributes to theaccessibilityof the Collective; some specialized skills and context neededCompleting actions or tasks that require some understanding and or specialised skill. I.e: Contribution paths (Ambassadors, supNERDs).Suggested Season 6 Rewards: 500 OP per SeasonImpact 3=Contributes todevelopmentof the Collective; low level of specialized skills and moderate context neededParticipation in a significant governance experimentSuggested Season 6 Rewards: 750 OP per SeasonImpact 4=Contributes todevelopmentof the Collective; moderately specialized skill, high context neededProviding valuable feedback implemented by the FoundationPublishing reports or analysis on governance process, programs, and/or policiesSuggested Season 6 Rewards: 1,200 OP per SeasonImpact 5=Contributes todevelopmentof the Collective, moderately specialized skills, high context neededActive voting participation in governance, by top delegates and/or CitizensSuggested Season 6 Rewards:2,000 OP per Reflection PeriodDelegates: 4,000 OP per SeasonCitizens: 2,000 OP per SeasonImpact 6=Contributes to theoperationsof the Collective; moderately specialized skills, high context neededAnticapture CommissionSuggested Season 6 Rewards: 2,500 OP per SeasonImpact 7=Managesoperationsof the Collective; moderately specialized skills, high context neededgovNERDsSuggested Season 6 Rewards: 8,000 OP per SeasonImpact 8= Drivesstrategicoutcomes for the Collective; highly specialized skills and contextGrants Council, Developer Advisory Board, Milestones and Metrics CouncilSuggested Season 6 Rewards: 20,000 OP per SeasonImpact 9=  Drivescriticaloutcomes of the Collective; highly specialized skills and context neededSecurity Council, Core DevelopmentSuggested Season 6 Rewards: > 20,000 OP per SeasonAll of the contributor roles and associated rewards described here are intended for independent and engaged community members who volunteer to provide their knowledge and expertise to the Collective and receive an honorarium in the form of OP. These volunteers are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any of its affiliates for any purposes.","This document outlines a non-binding framework for rewarding contributions to the Optimism Collective.  Rewards, distributed primarily in OP tokens, are retroactive and based on an Impact Rating system (1-9), reflecting contribution type and impact.  The framework aims for consistent reward allocation, prioritizing outputs over inputs.  Season 6 reward suggestions range from 250 OP (Impact 1) to over 20,000 OP (Impact 9).  Future iterations will involve a potential Budget Board to refine the framework, ensuring streamlined budgeting and community input.  All contributors are volunteers, not employees.  Special thanks are given to several individuals for their feedback.

This usually occurs as part of the Operating Budget proposal process.In order to propose changes to a Charter, to be implemented at the start of a Season, an amendment proposal can be made by any prospective Lead. The ACC was originally authorized to operate for a duration of two Seasons. In order for the ACC to continue for an additional Season(s), a prospective Lead will need to propose an amendment to the original Charter using the process and template outlined below.Amendments that are part of an Operating Budget proposal are approved as part of the Operating Budget proposal and are subject to the corresponding voting procedures. Amendments to the ACC Charter, which does not have a corresponding budget, are subject to the same voting procedure as the original proposal (quorums, approval thresholds, approvals, etc.) In the case of the ACC, this requires a 30% quorum and a 51% approval threshold in the Token House (not subject to Citizens‚Äô House veto.)Amendment Proposal TemplateProposal Type:Please indicate the proposal type outlined in the Operating ManualOriginal Proposal:Author should link to existing Charter on github, hostedhereProposed Amendments:This should link to a PR request to the current version of the proposal, hostedhereChange log:Please provide a plain English summary of the major changes proposed.

The ACC, initially a two-season entity, needs amendment approval for continuation.  Amendments are voted on using procedures mirroring the original charter's approval (e.g., 30% quorum, 51% approval in the Token House for ACC).  The proposal must include the original charter, a link to proposed changes (PR request), a change log summarizing modifications, and confirmation the PR reflects the log.  Upon approval, the PR merges with the official charter.

If the number of Security Council signers is reduced below 8, then a safety mechanism is activated which hands control of the Security Council to the Foundation.AccountabilityAll [structure] members are subject to Representative Removal as outlined in the Operating Manual. Removal votes will occur before the end of the next voting cycle. Please seeRepresentative Structure Frameworkfor additional details about edge cases related to removal.All representatives may be removed from their position for failing to uphold the responsibilities outlined in the relevant Charter or for failing to act with honesty, integrity, and transparency. If there is a vote to remove a representative, the Lead, or a simple majority of the remaining membership, may appoint a replacement for the remainder of the term. If a Security Council member is removed, a contingent vote for their replacement on the Council will run in the same voting cycle (the next nearest voting cycle.)Special Considerations for the Security CouncilThe Security Council can act unilaterally to remove a participant who fails to satisfy the requirements of this Charter if such failure falls within the defined scope of the Council‚Äôs emergency powers (see ‚ÄúStructure ‚Äì Emergency Response‚Äù above).Security Council members may be removed for failure to satisfy the requirements of this Charter immediately via an Emergency Response. A vote for their replacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.Additionally, if a Security Council key holder fails to prove access to their keys by satisfying the requirements of a scheduled liveness check (see ‚ÄúParticipants ‚Äì Responsibilities,‚Äù above), that participant will be automatically removed from the Council. A vote for their replacement on the Council would run in the next nearest voting cycle.Any time a key holder is removed from the Council, the threshold may also be reduced to as long as the ratio of the threshold to the number of signers remains above 75%. If the number of signers is reduced below 8, then a safety mechanism is activated which hands control of the Security Council to the Foundation.The [structures] will conduct a retrospective at the end of term which will be posted to the forum by the last day of the term.While persistent structures will be assumed to be renewed each Season, delegates may submit Dissolution Proposals if they believe a persistent structure is no longer fulfilling its mandate and should be discontinued.BudgetA Proposed Budget, linking to this Charter, will be proposed by each prospective Lead, subject to approval by governance.

All other Charters, must seek governance approval for major changes to the scope, structure, responsibilities, or budget of the Charter.It should finally be reiterated that the role of all structures are intended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its functionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed by other means. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective to reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full and final dissolution of any non-essential structures.","This charter establishes the [structure name]'s structure, responsibilities, and Season [X] goals, superseding previous versions.

Collective  Strategy üß≠,Season 7: Intent,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-intent/9292,"Special thanks to members of theFeedback Commissionfor discussion and review.This post outlines the main strategic goal of the Collective for 1H25 (Season 7 Intent) and highlights the contributions the Collective will support towards that goal. The audience for this post is all contributors towards the Collective.If you‚Äôre a builder and want to understand how to Get a Grant - skip tohere.Don‚Äôt want to read? Watch theSeason 7 Intents explainer videoinstead.Season 7 IntentThe Foundation recently outlined our two yearvisionfor the Superchain. Executing on this vision will require collaboration among all of the Collective‚Äôs contributors. The Collective uses Intents to guide these contributions so that OP Labs, the Foundation, OP Chains, the Token House, the Citizens House, and the many builders helping to make the Superchain a reality are all working towards the same goals.What are Intents?Intents are high level strategic goals the entire Collective works towards.All contributions in the Collective should be working towards the Intents.In Season 7, we will have one Intent, focused on a core pillar of our Superchain Product Vision: Interoperability.For more information about Interoperability and the Collective‚Äôs overall strategy, seethis.Season 7 Intent1440√ó516 9.02 KBCross-chain asset transfers will be defined as the movement of an asset between two chains that relies on underlying Superchain interop messaging ‚Äì which delivers consistent security assumptions and 1-block latency UX.Moving this metric requires the launch of Interop on the Superchain. In advance of Interop launching, Collective programs will aim to grow a set of supporting metrics (described in the Governance Fund Missions section below) to prepare the Superchain for successful adoption of Interop.Note: While the Season 7 Intent focuses the Collective on making progress towards the Superchain Product Vision, our commitment to decentralization has not changed. The goal is not to have the Foundation and OP Labs accomplish these Intents by ourselves but rather to build a governance system capable of accomplishing these goals without us in the future.RoadmapsIn an effort to improve transparency and coordination with Collective contributors in working towards this Intent, OP Labs and the Foundation have published high level public roadmaps for the next 6 months. This is big step towards enabling more Collective contributions, a critical step in decentralization. More detailed technical roadmaps will be provided at the beginning of next year.The core development program led by OP Labs will work towards these Intents via the public roadmap outlined below:Development ProjectsBudgetHow is impact evaluated?Deliver the MVP for interop that showcases the functionality between at least two OP Chains4M OPFull functionality including interop proofs audited and delivered to the Superchain.Deliver upgrades to OP Chains to reachStage 11.5M OPL2BEAT recognizes these chains asStage 1.Build infrastructure and processes to safely scale upgrades for the Superchain.1.5M OPDeliver multi-threaded 64 bit Cannon to Superchain, create a robust incident response process for SEV 0 / SEV 1 incidents vetted by the Foundation and automate deployments using op-deployer.Deliver alternate Rust Stack and make progress towards Stage 2.1.5M OPDeliver OP Reth as one of the sequencers that can be run in production and release Kona (alternate fault proof program in Rust) and Asterisc (alternative Fault Proof VM targeting Risc V) running live offchain alongside the current Go implementation.Drive adoption of ERC7802 and add support for interoperable ETH.1M OPSupport interoperable ETH between at least two chains and support 100+ ERC7802 deployments.We estimate9.5M OP from the Foundation Budgetwill be required to execute on the above roadmap.The Foundation will work towards these Intents via the growth and governance roadmaps outlined below:Growth ProjectsTimelineBudgetGrowth Campaign: Stablecoin TVLQ12M OPGrowth Campaign: TBAQ22M OPGrow the set of Stage 1 Chains on the SuperchainQ1-Q25-10M OPEcosystem Partnerships to support InteroperabilityQ1-Q25-8M OPEthereum L1 MarketingQ1-Q21M OPAirdropsQ1-Q25-10M OPGovernance ProjectsTimelineImprove Credibility of ElectionsQ1Onchain Governance FundQ1Grants Council Autonomous OperationsQ1Improve Data Infrastructure Supporting Retro FundingQ1Increase Votable Supply of OPQ1-Q2Voter Selection ExperimentsQ1-Q2Improve Security Council Operations & Upgrade WorkflowQ2Propose Interop Blockspace CharterQ2Ship Permissionless Proposal Rights v1Q2Staking Collective ETHQ2Total estimated budget2M OPWe estimate22-35M OP from the Foundation Budgetwill be required to execute on the above roadmaps.While the Foundation‚Äôs budget doesn‚Äôt require approval, we have provided our best estimates of the cost of supporting these roadmaps in an effort to better inform the budgeting process in other parts of the Collective (such as the Token House and Citizens‚Äô House.) Line item estimates for Growth projects indicate tokens distributed through the program described. Line item estimates for the governance team roadmap are not provided as they are difficult to estimate on a standalone basis.Note: These are estimated budget amounts. The Foundation may spend more or less than these estimates to execute on these roadmaps. To reference actual spend, the Foundation publishes budget reports twice per year on the forumhere. The Foundation currently operates with the budget allocated to the Foundation in the initial token supply. If the Foundation needs more tokens to continue operating in the future, additional token budget will be subject to governance approval.MissionsCollective contributors play a critical role in executing on strategic initiatives which fall outside the core teams‚Äô roadmaps. Collective contributors work towards the Intents by executing Missions. Missions are specific initiatives aimed at making measurable progress towards an Intent. They are clearly scoped, and can be executed by Collective contributors start-to-finish in less than 12 months.Missions may be supported by the Foundation, Retro Funding, or the Governance Fund. This is an expansion of the previous scope of Missions. The goal is to unify the Collective‚Äôs token allocation system under one common set of goals (Intents) and one common allocation framework (Missions). All impact generated by Missions will be evaluated on standardized and regularly recurring measurement dates.Missions Graphic1440√ó768 15.3 KBNote: The Season 7 Intent is ambitious and therefore, some Missions may extend into Season 8. The eligibility criteria for OP Chains will be shared in January; you can expect roughly 10 chains to be eligible.Foundation MissionsIn Season 7, the Foundation will publish a series of Missions, supported by the Foundation‚Äôs budget.In an effort to further decentralize this process, the Foundation will ask the Developer Advisory Board to select applicants and assess milestones towards completion. The Foundation will ask OP Labs and/or Open Source Observer to measure additional impact at the end of the Season.More detailed specifications for Foundation Missions will be made available at the start of Season 7. They may include projects like:ERC-7683 Integration with Native Interop:Support cross-L2 sends via Intents natively integrated with Superchain interoperabilityERC-3770 Integration with Native Interop:Support cross-L2 addressing with Superchain interoperabilityMultichain Paymaster Support:Execute parallel transactions on multiple chains without gasSuperchain Interop Oracle:Cross-chain oracle service that retrieves real-time price feeds ETH L1 or other supported Superchain network using interopThe Foundation may issue additional Missions throughout the course of Season 7, similar to the Grants Council‚Äôs ‚Äúrolling mission requests.‚Äù Most Missions are not fully specified.

The plan is to refine and perfect the ability to reward these contributions before expanding our capabilities to measure additional contributions. While not reflected above as a Season 7 initiative, the Foundation plans to propose an OP Stack program, starting with a limited scope around supporting Ethereum Core Development, in Season 8.For more information on Retro Funding in 2025, and how it related to our long-term commitment to Ether‚Äôs Phoenix, check out theRetro Funding 2025 blog post.Additional details about Citizen involvement and voting details related to the above Missions will be published at a later date.Up to 16M OP will be requested from the Retro Fundto support these Missions, to be approved by Citizens.Governance Fund MissionsThe Token House will work towards two Missions in Season 7. The objective of all Governance Fund Missions is to make progress towardsgrowing Superchain TVL, as measured by the metrics below.Launching interoperability will be a Season-long project. In advance of interop going live on the Superchain ‚Äì and allowing the Collective to focus on driving the cross-chain asset transfer metric mentioned in the Intent ‚Äì these TVL-related metrics will help prepare the Superchain for robust adoption of interoperability once it goes live. The Collective‚Äôs hypothesis is that a vibrant, interoperable economy will lead to long term growth and continued development.The Governance Fund Missions will reward progress towardsgrowing Superchain TVL, by making grants that move the sub-metrics below.Increase Superchain TVL (denominated in ETH)Increase Stablecoin TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Wrapped Asset TVL across the SuperchainIncrease Bridged Asset TVL across the SuperchainProjectBudgetFundWho selects projects?Who evaluates impact?When is impact evaluated?Governance Fund Missions10.5M OPGovernance FundGrants Council; Decision market participantsMilestones and Metrics Council and/or Open Source ObserverAt end of SeasonGrants Council Mission10M OPDecision Market Mission500k  OPThere are two Missions to allocate grants, using different methods, in an attempt to move these metrics.Grants Council: The Token House currently entrusts the Grants Council to make grants from the Governance Fund.

Collective  Strategy üß≠,Revenue Opportunities for the Optimism Collective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/revenue-opportunities-for-the-optimism-collective/9045,"The post ‚ÄúAccelerated Decentralization Proposal For Optimism‚Äù sparked a fruitful conversation that helped highlight an unresolved tension:several delegates maintain the thesis that sequencer fees are going to 0.Considering that Optimism‚Äôs revenues are tied to sequencer revenues, exploring alternative ways to generate income (contributing to the sustainability of the collective and its programs) is highly strategic.Accelerated Decentralization Proposal For OptimismThe value proposition of the Superchain may be correct, but we, along with other delegates, continue to maintain the thesis that sequencer fees are going to 0.While there is no ‚Äòimmediate urgency‚Äô to achieve this, I believe it would be beneficial to start a deeper conversation on this topic to tap into the collective intelligence.To give structure to the process, I propose using the first two steps suggested by the ‚Äòcollective proposal creation‚Äôdescribed in the sociocratic model.I like this framework because it emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem and defining ‚Äòthe rules of the game‚Äô before jumping into suggesting solutions in a creative brainstorming process.Collective Proposal Creation:Step 1 ‚Äì Understanding the Issue: First, a moment where we focus on grasping the context before diving into solutions. The intention is to create a list of ‚Äòdimensions‚Äô that the proposal should include or take into consideration to address the underlying needs and ensure it is sustainable over time.Step 2 ‚Äì Explore Ideas: A moment to aspire to collective creativity, widening the scope of ideas.Step 2a ‚Äì Picture forming (dimensions): It is confirmed that there is shared understanding and acceptance of the ‚Äòlist of dimensions‚Äô to consider, ensuring that all elements are compatible with each other.Step 2b ‚Äì Gathering proposal ideas: A brainstorming session is invited, which can occur synchronously or asynchronously. Here, ideas may oppose each other. The goal is quantity over quality. Ideally, we all chip in with ideas.Step 2c ‚Äì Synthesize: A smaller group of participants (whether representatives of stakeholders or leaders in the process) are invited to create a ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù that integrates the best of all ideas in a way that addresses the entire (or a good portion of the) list of dimensions.The result of this synthesis could be seen as a valuable input for the OP Foundation to create a proposal based on it, as suggested in the current phase of ‚ÄòThe Path to Open Metagovernance‚Äô.List of dimensions:Therefore, the first step would be to agree (both the Foundation and Labs, as well as other relevant voices from the collective) on the list of questions/dimensions that any successful proposal (for a revenue model) must address. In other words, what elements it should include and what limitations exist.Some examples of things to consider. The proposed model should:Be executable even if the sequencer fees go to 0.Respect theWorking Constitutionand the guiding principles of theLaw of Chains.Be compatible with the protection of user rights and the security of funds from a technical perspective.Operate under a four-pillar design philosophy of simplicity, pragmatism, sustainability, and optimism.Contribute to scale Ethereum technology and values & build an internet that benefits all, and is owned by all.Do you have any additional considerations that I haven‚Äôt mentioned? What is the frame of reference that we cannot forget? What prior agreements should not be modified?cc.@GFXlabs@Gonna.eth@MattGov.eth@AnthiasLabs@ccerv1@SEEDGov@LuukDAO@systemIn conclusion, I hope you see this as an invitation to delve deeper into this conversation in a structured manner, with the confidence that we can continue to innovate in how we add value to the ecosystem sustainably over time.If there is a previous thread or a better channel for this, I apologize for my ignorance. I remain attentive and at your disposal.","Optimism's anticipated zero sequencer fees necessitate exploring alternative revenue models for its sustainability.  A proposed solution uses a sociocratic model: first, defining crucial dimensions (e.g.,  zero-fee viability, user rights protection, alignment with existing governance) for any new model; second, collaboratively brainstorming and synthesizing potential solutions. This structured approach, involving the Optimism Foundation and community, aims to create a sustainable revenue model that aligns with Optimism's values and long-term goals.

Updates  and Announcements üì¢,"Namespace - Builder Grant Update (Season 5, Cycle 19)",https://gov.optimism.io/t/namespace-builder-grant-update-season-5-cycle-19/8794,"GM Optimists, I‚Äôm Cap, the founder ofNamespace. I‚Äôm writing to report on our progress and show what we‚Äôve done so far.We received an OP Grant fromSeason 5, Cycle 19, to scale ENS to OP and enable easy ENS Subname integration for other projects and dapps on OP.Feedback is appreciated and possibly some devs using and testing our infrastructure for minting and managing Subnames on OP.Namespace introIn a nutshell, Namespace helps teams and individuals to easily integrate ENS into their dapps, and start issuing .eth names or subnames to their users / community. We build dev tools for developers and a user-friend app (app.namespace.tech) for individual ENS name owners, to easily issue Subnames. Namespace is also one of the 9 official ENS Service Providers taking the lead on partnerships, integrations, and building tools and apps that help streamline ENS adoption!Proposal SummaryThe goal of the project is to enable minting ENS subnames on Optimism with Fault proof verification. This is achieved by utilizing the CCIP protocol, which allows storing ENS subnames and records on L2 chains. The chains are resolved through an offchain gateway application, which verifies the stored data. Furthermore with the introduction of the EVM Gateway by ENS, the data can be stored and verified trustlessly, meaning that the Gateway cannot manipulate the data.Milestones overviewIntegrate CCIP (EVM Gateway)Deploy Minting and Listing contracts on OP2.1 Testnet2.2 MainnetAuditWrite developer documentation for easy integrationIntegrate new OP Contracts with the Namespace platform(only testnet)Completion, User Testing User adoption + Feedback loop for improvementLaunch the code and initiate OP expansionMilestone 1The overview of the architecture that outlines the implementation of the CCIP protocol using the EVM Gateway and fault proofs:1600√ó962 197 KBIn the CCIP architecture the clients, such as wallets, need to be able to support CCIP, which requires handling the callback response from the resolver contract. For our project, we have implemented the OpVerifierResolver contract using the EVM Verifier fromUnruggableby@nxt3d. We have also utilized thegateway libraryfrom Unruggable in order to fetch L2 proofs. Once the proofs are passed back to the client, the client will make the callback call back to OpVerifierResolver and get the verified result.Milestone 2Use case for listing and mintingopsubs.ethsubnames on Optimism Sepolia, and resolving subnames on L1 Sepolia.L1 Contracts deployed on SepoliaOPFaultVerifier(contains the link to the EVM Gateway and helps with constructing the request for storage slots on OP)OpVerfierResolver(the resolver contract which references OPFaultVerifier)Minting and listingopsubs.ethlistedon Optimism Sepoliamysub.opsubs.ethmintedon Optimism Sepolia, also setting theaddress recordThe resolver updated with theOpVerifierResolver addressTheaddress recordnow resolves to the address set in the second step above, utilizing the CCIP resolution process, which allows the client to call the gateway to fetch the verifiable data from L2.1267√ó626 147 KBMilestone 3We are in the process of hiring an auditing company to audit our implementation for minting subnames on Optimism and Base.Milestone 4We have started writing developer documentation for our SDK. The SDK is a TypeScript library built to simplify the integration of ENS Subname registrations into Web3 projects. It provides developers with a simple way to interact with Namespace‚Äôs backend APIs and smart contracts.The primary intention for the SDK is to streamline the ENS integration and Subname issuance on different L2 chains (Base, Optimism, etc.).You can read more about it on our officialNamespace Docs.Milestone 5Currently, we are refactoring our backend to create new endpoints just for listing and minting subnames on the Namespace app (app.namespace.tech), configured through the Manager, which will include both our existing L1 subname functionality, as well adding the support for L2 subnames.AsksWe‚Äôd love to have some builders integrate ENS into their dapps and issue Subnames on OP for their users / community.If interested, please join ourNamespace DevTG group for convenience, assistance, and vibes.Contact infoCap: TG or Twitter:@thecaphimselfNamespaceWebsite:https://www.namespace.tech/Docs:https://docs.namespace.tech/Github:Namespace ¬∑ GitHubX:x.comFarcaster:Warpcastaccount orWarpcastchannel","Namespace, an official ENS service provider, reports progress on its Optimism grant to scale ENS subname integration.  Using CCIP and the ENS EVM Gateway, they've enabled fault-proof subname minting and listing on Optimism's testnet and are preparing for mainnet launch.  Milestones include contract deployment, auditing (currently underway), and developer documentation creation for a TypeScript SDK simplifying ENS integration.  Namespace invites developers to integrate ENS subnames into their dApps on Optimism and offers support through its developer Telegram group.  Their user-friendly app, app.namespace.tech, facilitates subname management.

Updates  and Announcements üì¢,Dark Forest ARES: Milestone 3 Submission and request for feedback,https://gov.optimism.io/t/dark-forest-ares-milestone-3-submission-and-request-for-feedback/9220,"GM optimism!On behalf of the DFArchon team, I am excited to announce that we have reached Milestone 3 ofDark Forest ARESproject, which received anOP grant in Season 5, Cycle 22.In this post, we outline our achievements and the upcoming steps. We encourage everyone, especially those interested in innovative game mechanics, to join our community, try out the game, and share your feedback!What is Dark Forest MUD?Dark Forest ARES(DFAres) is a community-run development of Dark Forest powerd by DFArchon team. From early 2023 to mid-2024, we developed four versions of DFAres. The code architecture of DFAres is based on the diamond standard (ERC2535).Since August, we began the process of porting Dark Forest to theMUD engine.For promotional purposes, we renamed the project to Dark Forest MUD, while the development content continues to follow the submitted milestones.We redesigned the code structure for both the smart contracts and the frontend, replacing many components of the project‚Äôs tech stack.image1920√ó1080 114 KBIn late October, we heldDark Forest MUD v0.1 Round 1, a six-day public testing event on Redstone mainnet. Players submitted approximately 122,880 transactions, using approximately 90,562,163,600 gas.What we deliveredWe have redesigned the organization of the game‚Äôs underlying data and logic architecture.To enhance code composability, the MUD engine follows an ECS (Entity-Component-System) design, where data is stored in tables and the logic for operations is placed in systems, enabling a clear separation between data and operational logic. Following this design principle, we categorize game entities into three main groups: planets, players, and artifacts, each with specific protocols. The protocol design for each entity includes the structure of data, the specific operations for data updates, and reserved interfaces to support interoperability with other entity protocols.In terms of smart contracts, we transitioned from the diamond (ERC2535) architecture to the MUD engine‚Äôs architecture.So far, we have developed the architecture for three main protocols: planets, players, and artifacts. We have fully implemented the planets protocol and completed approximately 60% of the players protocol.Variable-rate game tick system. Previously, game states were updated strictly based on block time. We have now implemented a tick system on top of block time, where all in-game state updates are driven by ticks. The variable-rate game tick system allows for pausing and resuming the game, as well as dynamically adjusting the rate of in-game state updates.The frontend tech stack has been updatedand can be mainly divided into the following three aspects:4.1. We have upgraded the build tool from Webpack to Vite and performed extensive version updates on various underlying dependencies, addressing numerous compatibility issues.4.2.

Updates  and Announcements üì¢,Data and Analytics Tooling for OP Mainnet and the Superchain,https://gov.optimism.io/t/data-and-analytics-tooling-for-op-mainnet-and-the-superchain/8952,"Hello all. We‚Äôre Token Flow, a data and analytics company that participated in RFG 1 of Season 4 (Onchain Data Tools & UI).UpdateOur proposal was to build tools to allow the community to analyze the full history of smart contracts on OP Mainnet through an Explorer and Data Platform.This functionality is now available to the community in two ways:Token Flow StudioStudio is a UI that replaces the envisaged explorer with a SQL editor that allows users to create much more flexible queries, charts and boards using decoded datasets for all blocks, transactions, events and calls from genesis onwards.Users can see the whole history of a contract, or search by address, transaction, block and many other parameters.In addition to OP Mainnet, also Base, Blast, Manta, Mint, Mode, Syndicate-Frame and Zora have been added to Studio outside the grant, with more Superchain and OP Stack L2s and L3s being added.Studio goes beyond what was originally envisaged with Explorer and APIs, and allows core teams and the wider community to conduct and share analysis at the cross-chain, chain, contract, or multi-contract level.Examples are shown below using OP Mainnet and Mode data (in progress):Cross chainState of SuperchainChainState of OptimismState of ModeProtocol / ContractEtherFi on ModeBMX perps on ModeMulti-protocol / contractDEXs on ModePerps competition on ModeA free plan is available to core teams, analysts and community members for non-commercial uses. The free plan is rate and query speed limited. Higher performance paid plans may also be offered in the future.Token Flow Data PlatformOP Mainnet blocks, transactions, events and calls are also available as full datasets via Snowflake in our Data Platform.Given how granular they are, these datasets are huge. For OP Mainnet and the OP Stack chains listed above, we have processed and host over 34 billion rows and 4.07 terrabytes of data (as at early September 2024).A free plan is available for non-commercial and non-redistribution use for OP Mainnet data (no charges from Token Flow, but Snowflake does charge computation cost). Other OP Stack chains are available on request.By sharing in this way users only pay for their own computation from conducting analysis, and Token Flow pays for storage.How to get startedStudiocan be accessedhere, and anyone can create an account. Once you have your account you can start a new query (which can then be added to a board), deciding whether you want it to be public or private.

(Tagging@PGovfor visibility).We encourage the community to try out Studio, and those with more intensive data needs to contact us about Data Platform access. If you have feedback or feature requests let us know via the support bot in our Discord server.We look forward to seeing what you build!","Token Flow, a data analytics company, announces the completion of its RFG 1 Season 4 grant.  Their resulting tools, Token Flow Studio and Data Platform, offer comprehensive analysis of OP Mainnet and other chains' smart contract history.

Updates  and Announcements üì¢,Foundation Year 3 Budget Update,https://gov.optimism.io/t/foundation-year-3-budget-update/8304,"SummaryThe Optimism Foundation‚Äôs operating budget of OP, subject to governance approval by the Token House, maintains the original budget set into motion in both Year 1 and Year 2 proposals.For this year‚Äôs operating budget, The Foundation is requesting zero additional OPand will continue deploying existing allocations against key initiatives across the Collective.There will not be a Token House vote on this budget as no OP is being requested.BackgroundThe Optimism Foundation administers a portion of the token supply to further the Collective‚Äôs goals. This set of tokens is referred to as the ‚ÄúFoundation Budget,‚Äù which must be utilized in line with overall OP Token Allocations.The primary operating budget for Year 2 (June 2023 - May 2024) carried over from the initial OP token allocation at thefounding of the Collectiveon April 24, 2022. In 2023, an additional 1 OP was requested (symbolically) towards Year 2‚Äôs budget as a means to initiate the Token House for future budget approvals. We received feedback from delegates that they did not like the symbolic vote and are therefore providing transparency into the budget for 2024 but will not initiate a symbolic vote.Overall OP AllocationsThe overall ecosystem allocations of the total initial supply of OP (as outlined in thegovernance documentation) are as follows:858,993,459 OP(20%) to Retroactive Public Goods Funding1,073,741,824 OP(25%) to Ecosystem Fund (Governance Fund, Partner Fund, Seed Fund, Unallocated)816,043,786 OP(19%) to User Airdrops810,329,332 OP(19%) to Core Contributors735,858,894OP(17%) to Sugar XaddiesIn April 2022, 30% of the total initial token supply was made available to the Foundation for administration in line with the overall token allocations detailed above.

The amount in the ‚ÄòUnallocated‚Äô bucket has been reduced by ~17.3M tokens, to 46.9M, to account for these tokens as ‚ÄúCommitted‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúCirculating.‚ÄùPercentages are rounded to the nearest tenth for simplicity. As a result, exact calculations based on these percentages may not match precisely.‚ÄúCirculating‚Äù refers to tokens with no known restrictions on sale or transfer.‚ÄúCommitted‚Äù refers to (1) OP tokens that have been granted subject to a lock-up + (2) all OP tokens that have been conditionally committed subject to vesting or completing milestones.Ecosystem GrowthOver the past year, Foundation tokens have been used to secure a variety of partnerships, bootstrapping the Superchain with a focus on bringing more L2s and tooling into the Collective. We had the opportunity to welcome some of the most prominent names in the space, including Base, Zora, Redstone, Frax, Celo, Worldcoin, Mode, and Lisk, all launching their own L2 blockspace built on the OP Stack.In addition, with a goal of reducing chain deployment friction, we set out to establish key infrastructure teams within the Superchain to help improve developer onramp experience. Notable groups like Blockscout, Chainlink, Safe, Gelato, and Conduit, just to name a few, joined as contributors to the cause.AirdropsThe Foundation successfully initiatedAirdrop #3(Sept 2023) andAirdrop #4(Feb 2024), delivering a total of 29,755,070.81 OP between the two.

Governance  Design üìê,Season 7 Anticapture Commission Charter Amendment,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-anticapture-commission-charter-amendment/9354,"Season 7: Anticapture Commission Charter Amendment ProposalThe Anticapture Commission was conceptualized and formally introduced as a Meta-governance structure in Season 5 of Governance, with a view towards preventing capture across the Optimism Collective, while simultaneously representing the interests of key individual delegates. Originally, theAnticapture Commission Charterwas authorized to operate for two seasons. It was further amended and carried forward intoSeason 6. Now at the completion of Season 6, the Anticapture Commission Charter is being proposed for renewal. If approved by the Token House, the Anticapture Commission would be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund in Season 7 and 8. The Anticapture Commission will not have an operating budget.If this proposal is approved, it will supersede any earlier Charter for the Anticapture Commission.Goals of the Anticapture CommissionAct as a governance structure composed of high-context delegates, with an aim towards preventing capture in the Token House and across the Collective: The main goal of the Commission is to prevent capture across the Optimism Collective. The Commission‚Äôs activities are performed in furtherance of this main goal.In furtherance of Goal No. 1, the ACC shall provide alerts to the Citizens‚Äô House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders. Any member of the Collective may flag a concern to be considered by the Anticapture Commission via the commission‚Äôs email or through the governance forum. The Commission is expected to brainstorm and identify areas of capture occurring in the collective, and proactively discuss ways in which capture can arise and how to mitigate such circumstances, including exploring and conducting dry run scenarios to identify and mitigate capture.  In alignment with theSeason 7 Intent, the Commission can monitor the progress in the decentralization objectives for the Season, and verify that the interoperability volume objectives among chains part of the Superchain are met fairly.Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens House veto: Exercising the Commission‚Äôs delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades and other proposals subject to Citizens‚Äô House veto. Hence, the Commission is expected to cast its vote on all such proposals.KPI for this Goal: The Commission is expected to vote in 100% of governance upgrade proposals.Vote on other proposals that are not subject to a Citizens House veto: In situations where the Delegate Members of the ACC believe a capture is occurring or is likely to occur, or it would be in the interest of the Optimism Collective for the ACC to signal its voting intention, the Commission may also cast its vote on proposals that are not subject to a Citizens House Veto.Act as a communication bridge between the Token House and the Citizens House: While the Anticapture Commission provides its duties in service to the token house, its alerts during instances of capture form an important input for any Citizen‚Äôs House Veto. Hence, the Anticapture Commission will seek to act as a bridging governance structure between the two houses of Governance, and in furtherance of this goal, the Anticapture Commission and its Delegates will seek to be part of Citizens House discussions in instances where the Citizens House considers a veto during the veto period.KPI for this Goal: The Commission is expected to participate in all discussions where the Citizens House is considering a veto.Evaluate decentralization progress across the Collective and hold the Collective accountable to its various decentralization objectives, including the milestones in theFoundation-proposed Decentralization Model, theSeason 7 Intentand in discussions around Phases II and II in theAccelerated Decentralization Proposal.Commission StructureThe Anticapture Commission would be composed of high impact delegates. Anticapture Commission votes would be cast based on the process finalized by member delegates which will be outlined in the Commission‚Äôs Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) at the start of the Season.Signing StructureThe Anticapture Commission will operate a X of Y Gnosis Safe Multisig, where X represents the threshold as agreed to by the Members of the Commission in the IOP for the season, and Y represents the total number of Delegate Members who are part of the Commission.Presently, the ACC Multisig is deployed on the Optimism Network with the contract address:0x3EEe61B92C36e97Be6319BF9096A1ac3c04a1466as a 10-of-25 Multisig, and this is subject to change as per future season‚Äôs membership, and as per the IOP approved by members of the Anticapture Commission.The Anticapture Commission will also operate a Snapshot Space for achieving internal quorum on various decisions and proposals.Signing ActionsThe Commission‚Äôs Multisig and Snapshot Spaces will be operated in accordance with the Internal Operating Procedure agreed to by the members of the Commission. The Commission‚Äôs Multisig will be solely used to exercise its vote or signal on Governance proposals, using the OP tokens delegated to the Multisig. The Commission shall not be authorized to make other transactions from its Multisig such as transfers or grants of any kind.MembershipMembership will be determined based on the below criteria at the beginning of each Season.Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporation.Members, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegates ANDMaintain = > 70% voting participation over the previous Season (including the following Reflection Period.)Have received retro rewards for governance participation in any Season.All qualifying members must opt-in to be part of the Commission. Any qualifying member may choose not to opt-in for any reason. If less than 50% of qualifying members choose not to opt-in before the start of Season 7, the Commission may be reconsidered.All members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture CommissionMember ResponsibilitiesProvide feedback, approval and/or coordinate authorship of any reports circulated to the Citizens House.Must attend the ACC Internal Meeting. Attendance can be fulfilled by making comments on the Internal Meeting agenda document and providing feedback.Maintain = > 50% voting participation on the Anticapture Commission Snapshot Space and the Anticapture Commission Safe (onchain) voting. As the ACC Multisig may have a higher number of signing authorities and a lower threshold, a Member may be considered as a participant in a particular vote if they sign or approve the proposal, or if they actively contribute to its discussion, or provide documented feedback on the particular vote.Participate in any discussion with the Citizens House during the Citizens House Veto Period, if the Commission has alerted the Citizens House to any potential capture in the Token House.Members must elect a Commission Lead for the Season. ‚Äã‚ÄãMembers may also elect a Commission Operations Coordinator (Ops) for the Season. In the event that no Ops is elected, the responsibilities of the Ops will be assumed by the Lead.Lead ResponsibilitiesDraft and enforce the Internal Operating Procedures.Host the regular Cycle Anticapture Commission Internal Meetings.Ensure that the Commission‚Äôs Multisig and other voting structures are up-to date and in consonance with the current membership of the Commission.Create onchain voting transactions from the delegation wallet, and Snapshot voting proposals for the Commission members to vote on.Author, or coordinate authorship, of any reports circulated to the Citizens HouseRequest renewal of the program at the end of the Season, if desired and discuss future funding strategies for the ACC with various stakeholders.Ops ResponsibilitiesPrepare written summaries of ACC Internal Meetings, which will be made to the Optimism Governance.Coordinate Member Activities: Track and document member voting, attendance, and other activities throughout the season.Authoring drafts for Communication threads and other ACC deliverables by coordinating with the Lead, as the need arises.Facilitate Approvals: Liaise with Commission members to secure approvals for urgent votes which may arise through the Season.Resignation processIf a member wishes to resign, they should inform the Lead.The Lead will then update the quorum on Snapshot and initiate the removal of the member from the Multisig.Their resignation will be communicated to the Collective through our Communication Thread.If the total number of ACC members falls below 10, the Foundation will remove delegation.Budget of the Anticapture CommissionThe Anticapture Commission does not have any operating budget. However, Delegate Members of the Anticapture Commission can expect that their time and effort in participation towards the Commission, and maintaining a 50% voting participation in the Commission‚Äôs votes throughout the season will be considered as a contributing input towards any potential Retro Governance Participation Rewards for the Season.Github PRA PR has been createdin the ethereum-optimism / OPerating-manual Repo for the Season 7 Anticapture Commission Charter Amendment","The Optimism Collective's Anticapture Commission (ACC) seeks a two-season charter renewal (Seasons 7 & 8), requesting 10M OP for voting, not operations.  The ACC, composed of top 100 active delegates, aims to prevent governance capture, alert the Citizens' House to power imbalances, and ensure fair decentralization progress.  Key responsibilities include voting on proposals (especially those subject to veto), bridging communication between governance houses, and evaluating decentralization.  Membership requires top delegate status, high voting participation, and KYC.  The ACC operates via a multisig and Snapshot space, guided by internal operating procedures.  No operating budget is allocated; member contributions are considered for retro rewards.

Governance  Design üìê,A case for the organizational chart,https://gov.optimism.io/t/a-case-for-the-organizational-chart/8727,"Special thanks to@brichis,@Pumbiand the@govNERDsfor the feedback and information support. And to the people at the Developer Advisory Board meeting for motivating to continue.Dear fellow members of the collective,As someone curious about organizational structures, I am surprised not to find any organizational chart that shows how the different operational roles are, both in the OP foundation and with the most active contributors of the collective.For me, having an organizational chart will work like a ‚Äòyou are here‚Äô on those park maps. Knowing who is where and who the people are connected to can be very useful; especially in a 100% virtual organization where you can‚Äôt get lost in the hallways.I admit that I am a ‚Äòvisual‚Äô person and perhaps my opinion is biased‚Ä¶but in order to ‚Äòshare‚Äô my vision I decided to create a prototype that exemplifies what I imagine.https://app.mural.co/t/alexsoto6941/m/alexsoto6941/1723490012295/dd52b073d03daf635e611f21d8f3f2f4fe1d0a70?sender=ud6461ce37fd968e224f71144Internal Communication Structure (Draft)Captura de pantalla 2024-08-14 a la(s) 13.03.381920√ó984 89.3 KBThis figure is inspired by sociocratic/holacratic structures where each ‚Äòcircle‚Äô represents a team of some kind. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating ‚Äòinterconnections‚Äô between circles promotes the idea that more information flow between teams has advantages when it comes to adapting to the changing environment. Which are increasingly recurrent.How to read this map *(and some suggestions)*:Each circle belongs to a ‚Äòteam‚Äô of some kind (which requires having ‚Äòmeetings‚Äô or status reports every so often).Whether sharing a telegram group or a private discord channel, the suggestion is to create a ‚Äòflow of information‚Äô where at least two people from each circle participate.People who are at the intersection of two circles belong to both teams as full members (and sociocracy encourages decisions to be made by consent).The most central circles should avoid making operational decisions to be executed by other circles (but allow them to define how to operate from their autonomy), and rather focus on sharing reports and generating alignment between all parties.Just because two people are not interconnected by circles doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt have direct communication. In fact, it‚Äôs amazing that we have the ability to send DMs at the speed of light.The more information flow, the more agility.mini-disclosureIn some cases I have put people at random as ‚Äòexamples‚Äô of ‚Äòlead‚Äô and ‚Äòrepresentative‚Äô for lack of more information on the matter. I am aware that there are errors and omissions in these lists.Anyone who has information to add can contact me as@alexsotodigitalSome considerations of this approach.Double Link:At each ‚Äòintersection‚Äô there are at least two people, which usually meansa ‚Äòlead‚Äô person (often established by the mother circle)a ‚Äòrepresentative‚Äô chosen by the rest of the circle.Double link is one of the main principles of sociocracy, as it makes sure there is no power-over and ensures flow of information and transparency in all directions. If there was only one person, the group could be in danger of:the person missing an important meeting (preventing a decision from being made or creating a communication gap between both circles).the intermediary person being able to traffic or omit information to avoid some issue.the lead person not having the well-being of the team in their interests and making commitments without it being the opinion of the group.Roles, not people:Although in this first prototype I write the names of the person (as they have chosen their user within the community) and not the role (such as ‚ÄòCode of Conduct Council Member 1/5‚Äô), I think it is important to highlight that this organizational chart is mapping ‚Äòroles‚Äô and not ‚Äòpeople‚Äô. That‚Äôs because:In an organizational chart with people, it is often perceived that the person is immovable and has greater resistance to change; especially in hierarchical organizations where there is ‚Äòa boss‚Äô.With roles, a person can be represented in several places in the organizational chart simultaneously (as happens here) which promotes greater mobility and accountability.In a structure by roles,a person can have several roles and a role can be inhabited by multiple people simultaneously.The Ask.I would like to point out that I created this on a Mural canvas in the absence of better technical skills. However, I think this could serve as a blueprint for some team that knows how to bring this to a 2.0 version.If you can think of any team that might be interested in collaborating with me to do this, please tag them in the comments.image1024√ó576 95.9 KBSome features I imagine:Being able to select the name of the role and when clicking on it, go to see the person or people who occupy it. There could be a link to the forum, as well as other contact information.Having some way of ‚Äòupdating‚Äô automatically (at a graphical level) once it is written in an internal database. This way, several people could have editing permissions and it would save time.Set the ‚Äòtime period‚Äô for which the participation agreement will be maintained and trigger a notification alarm to let us know it‚Äôs time to update or make a change.Being supported on a website that is own by the collective.CommitmentUntil we find a more automatic solution, I am committed to keeping this version as up to date as possible.If there are any changes you would like to request, you can find me as@alexsotodigitalor write to me atalex.soto.digital@gmail.comWhat do you think?Do you think this would be useful?Is it worth building?Yeees!MaybeNah0voters","This proposal advocates for a visual organizational chart for a virtual collective, modeled after sociocratic/holacratic structures.  The author, inspired by ""you are here"" maps, created a prototype (linked) depicting interconnected teams (""circles"") with designated representatives, promoting information flow and agility.  The chart prioritizes roles over individuals, allowing for flexibility and accountability.  The author seeks collaboration to refine this prototype into a dynamic, web-based tool with features like automatic updates and role-specific information, improving internal communication and transparency.

Governance  Design üìê,Code of Conduct Council Dissolution Proposal,https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-dissolution-proposal/9321,"Council Dissolution ProposalAs outlined in the Operating Manual, a persistent Council is expected to continue into the next Season unless a Dissolution proposal is approved. The Foundation is proposing the dissolution of the Code of Conduct Council.Name of Council, Board, or Commission:Code of Conduct CouncilCurrent Charter:linkReason for Dissolution Proposal:This proposal for dissolution is not related to the dedication, intentions, or contributions of Season 5 or Season 6 members. These contributors have played a very valuable role in our experimentation with decentralized accountability. We hope all former and current Code of Conduct Council members remain involved in the Collective in high impact roles.The need for an enforceable Code of Conduct remains unchanged. The need for a Code of Conduct, as well as our experiments around its enforcement, are well outlined in the posts below:Proposal to Reclassify Grant Misusage EnforcementRescoping #2In summary, over multiple iterations, we have learned that it works best to decentralize enforcement among multiple parties (the Foundation, the Milestones and Metrics Committee, the supNERDs/govNERDs, etc.). Our experiments have also reaffirmed the need for a governance minimized approach to prevention and enforcement, reflected in voting design (in Retro Funding) that reduces the opportunity for self-dealing rather than trying to police it. The Code of Conduct Council has been critical in informing these learnings.However, we believe the Code of Conduct should not be enforced by an elected Code of Conduct Council for two main reasons:Council Structure is Political:The Council structure is not well suited to an enforcement mandate. The Council is elected by tokenholders but is also expected to make unbiased enforcement decisions involving those same tokenholders. This function should be fulfilled by civil servants, or non-politically selected participants that fulfill a job for the Collective.Community feedback:‚ÄúCurrently, the CoCC relies on the Token House for both budget and renewal, which creates a conflict of interest. There‚Äôs inherent pressure to align decisions with Token House preferences rather than ensuring impartiality. This dynamic can undermine the legitimacy of dispute resolution efforts, as it may lead to decisions driven by budget concerns rather than fairness. When parties are dissatisfied with mediation outcomes, they might vote against renewing budgets, regardless of the fairness of the process.‚ÄùWhat this could mean in practice is that the Foundation contracts a third party to provide mediation and conflict resolution services and/or the current role of Code of Conduct Council members is folded into the govNERDs contribution path.Governance Minimization:In minimizing enforcement efforts and spreading enforcement among multiple powers to reduce concentration of power, the scope of the Code of Conduct Council has been reduced to what is essentially platform moderation. As expressed in Season 5, we don‚Äôt believe it is governance minimized to elect a group of people to provide platform moderation services, as this is not a necessary model for this type of work.There is a lot of governance overhead associated with Councils (running elections, onboarding members, operating budgets, etc.) and, therefore, the Collective can likely only effectively support 4-5 Councils. That means we need to save the Council structure for the few functions that are well suited to this structure and high enough impact to warrant the associated overhead.We thank all members of both the Season 5 and Season 6 Councils for your contributions in this ongoing experiment. It‚Äôs hard to iterate towards something new and we appreciate your willingness to help the Collective understand how this function should evolve.If this proposal is approved, it will supersede any approved Operating Budget for the next Season and the Council will not continue operations.Proposals by the Foundation don‚Äôt require delegate approvals. However, in the case of a Dissolution proposal, delegate approvals are required. 4 Top 100 delegate approvals will be required by December 11th at 19:00 GMT for this to move to a vote","The Foundation proposes dissolving the Code of Conduct Council (CoCC), citing inherent conflicts of interest stemming from its elected structure and tokenholder-dependent budget.  The CoCC's enforcement role, deemed overly political, will be decentralized among existing Collective entities (Foundation, Milestones and Metrics Committee, govNERDs).  This aligns with a governance-minimization strategy, focusing on preventing conflict rather than solely reacting to it. While the need for a Code of Conduct remains, its enforcement will transition to a more impartial, non-elected process, potentially via third-party contracting.  Delegate approval is needed by December 11th for the proposal to proceed to a vote.

This will become the authoritative version in the case theSeason 6 proposed Amendmentis approved.OP Chains play an incredibly important role in the Superchain future.Welcoming Baseto the Collective was an exciting first step. The next step in building the Superchain future is ensuring a broad range of OP Chains are represented in the Token House. See here for more information on our approach toOnboarding OP Chains to Optimism Governance.The Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains.The Chain Delegation Program, approved in Season 5, allowed OP to be delegated to OP Chains to enable them to actively participate in Optimism‚Äôs governance in Seasons 5 and 6.This program pertains only to L2‚Äôs as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.Please note: The Foundation will not facilitate OP Chain membership in the Citizens‚Äô House. Badgeholders represent individual members of the Optimism Collective; they should not represent a project or company in their capacity as badgeholders. Furthermore, in the near future, the criteria required to become a Citizen will be determined by Citizens‚Äô and approved via governance.The Chain Delegation Program temporarily delegates a portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to value-aligned OP Chains based on the criteria outlined below.  Delegations will be made as additional Chains qualify.A total of 20M OP is reserved to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, using idle tokens in the Governance Fund. Delegations will be made as OP Chains qualify, on a rolling basis until, the first 15 qualifying OP Chains have gone through the program.OP Chain Qualification Criteria (Cumulative):OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating > 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive monthsAdditionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).Chains operatingStandard Blockspacewould be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.OP Mainnet will not be eligible for this programDelegation:OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectations:OP Chains must maintain a >70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next SeasonDelegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement onvote.optimism.io. It is also recommended to set an ENS avatar with the logotype of the OP Chain.Chain delegates should identify a point of contact that will be responsible for this delegation. It is recommended that this delegate attend community governance calls, hosted bi-weekly.Chain delegates will be top 100 delegates, which mean they are eligible to provide approvals on proposal drafts and should be active in the governance forums.All delegations made through this program will be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches 3M in delegation (including Partner Fund grants able to be delegated), at the time of opt-in.Accountability:Any OP Chain delegate found to be violating the self-dealing section ofOptimist Expectationswill have their Chain Delegation Program delegations removed for the remainder of the program.","Optimism's amended Season 6 Chain Delegation Program allocates 20M OP to onboard approximately 15 OP Chains into governance.  Eligible chains must generate over 1 ETH/month in sequencer revenue for two consecutive months, and either 1M in monthly transaction volume or operate Standard Blockspace.  A 250k OP base delegation is offered, with bonuses up to 1.5M OP.  Chains must maintain >70% voting participation; otherwise, delegation is revoked.  Delegates must meet specific engagement requirements, including ENS naming and community participation.  The program aims to ensure diverse OP Chain representation in Optimism's governance, with accountability measures in place to prevent self-dealing.

Governance  Design üìê,Looking Ahead: Long-term Onchain Governance Architecture,https://gov.optimism.io/t/looking-ahead-long-term-onchain-governance-architecture/9014,"Looking ahead: Long-term Onchain Governance ArchitectureWe‚Äôre thrilled to share some updates and our vision for the future of onchain governance within our ecosystem. As many of you know, Agora has been instrumental in moving the governance fund onchain, and their upcoming proposal [link when available] marks a significant milestone for us. This move not only aligns with our commitment to transparency and decentralization but also opens up a conversation about the future of onchain governance within our ecosystem.As we navigate this transition, we‚Äôre looking ahead at the longer-term future of onchain governance and how it can evolve to better serve our community. Currently, theOperating Manualserves as a robust framework guiding our governance processes. Translating its full functionality onchain presents challenges and opportunities that we believe are crucial to address in the open.Proposal Permissioning: Balancing Innovation with PrudenceAs we move the Governance Fund onchain, an important next step to consider is proposal permissioning.Industry Standard vs. Current ModelThe industry standard for onchain governance involves minimal barriers to proposal submissions, relying on token-based thresholds to filter proposals.Our current model, which requires delegate approvals and adheres to voting cycles, offers a more granular system that we believe is crucial for maintaining the quality and relevance of proposals. However, this is enforced at the social layer by the Optimism Foundation‚Äîmeaning only the OF is authorized to propose onchain, and offchain proposers must trust the OF to post their votes onchain:image2256√ó1440 137 KBWhy a Direct Move to Permissionless Could be ProblematicMost DAOs use a token-based threshold requirement for permissionless proposal submission to prevent spam or malicious proposals from entering the voting process. A low barrier to entry can lead to an overwhelming number of proposals, many of which may lack substance or relevance to the community‚Äôs goals. This not only clutters the governance process but also dilutes the attention and resources that could be directed towards more impactful proposals. The main issue with using minimum token-based thresholds as a filtering mechanism is that it reduces participation relative to our current system (which allows the top 100 delegates to provide approvals) and creates plutocratically-gated proposal rights, which is antithetical to the principles outlined in ourWorking Constitution.Additionally, the industry‚Äôs standard proposal structures don‚Äôt allow for logic encoded in ourOperating Manual, which protects against common attack vectors including vote buying or borrowing, bribery, non-standard voting periods that can take advantage of voter apathy or advantageous ordering, malicious proposals, etc.While these concerns could be partially mitigated by increasing the token-based thresholds required to propose, this presents a fundamental, plutocratic-favoring tradeoff‚Äîthe higher the threshold, the less participatory governance can be, and the more ‚Äúagenda-setting powers‚Äù are concentrated into the hands of large token holders. This means that proposal thresholds are an active subject of contention in many other communities, and go against the principle of anti-plutocracy outlined in theWorking Constitutionof the Optimism Collective.Our Vision: A More Granular ApproachAs we consider the future of onchain governance, we believe that we should strive for a system which mirrors the sophistication and nuance of ourOperating Manual. This means creating an onchain governance model that allows for different types of proposals, and for rules and requirements which can be dependent on the specifics of the proposals in question.As an illustrative example, imagine the following:image2912√ó1728 227 KBWe believe that such a system would not only preserve the integrity of our governance process but also set a new standard for DAOs and onchain communities.Next Steps: Bridging the GapTo achieve this vision, we believe that initial focus should be on replicating the full functionality of theOperating Manualonchain, with a focus on Gov Fund proposals first. This work includes:Delegate Approvals:Implementing the ability to gate proposals on multiple delegate approvals, as currently specified in the Operating Manual, with thresholds not reliant on token-based balances.Voting Cycles:By requiring that proposals are only submitted within [1] day of voting cycles, we can preserve the current cadence of voting cycles specified in the Operating Manual.Type-aware Permissioning:By implementing these rules with an awareness of proposal types, we can incrementally bring permissionless proposals online for additional proposal types.Short-term Open QuestionsWhile the above work is straightforward enough, some questions do remain which we‚Äôd like to open up for community discussion:Ossification of Voting Cycles:In the past, we have changed voting cycles‚Äô and seasons‚Äô dates. Moving this onchain opens the question of how to proceed: either we permanently set voting cycles, or introduce a permissioned role which can change them. We propose that, to start, since the Optimism Foundation will retain a veto right over Gov Fund allocations that the Optimism Foundation can just hold this role to start.Additional Size-based Safeguards:One open design question is: are there benefits to implementing more stringent requirements for proposal submissions, such as requiring more delegate approvals for proposals allocating higher amounts of OP? This would be a divergence from the Operating Manual today, but could be appropriate given the transition to permissionlessness.Proposal Edits:How can we accommodate changes to proposals during the review period without compromising the voting process? Is it sufficient to allow arbitrary edits, but have any edits to reset delegate approvals?Future Work: Expanding Our Governance ToolkitLooking ahead, we‚Äôre excited about the possibilities of further enhancing our onchain governance architecture, which extends beyond proposal permissioning. We wanted to share what we see as some of the big architectural challenges in the long-term:Onchain Citizens‚Äô House Voting:Integrating Citizens‚Äô House voting directly into our onchain processes, allowing for bringing multi-house decisions fully onchain. While there is some bare-bones work which needs to be done no matter what, we believe that further testing and refinement of the Citizens‚Äô House Veto mechanism is required before we can finalize this architecture.Onchain Citizenship Selection:Allowing for onchain governance to expand the Citizen set over time presents an extremely large design space, with less prior industry work to draw from than token voting systems. Because of how complex this design space is, more experimentation and clarity is needed before any productionization could begin.Emergency Off-cycle Votes: We think the community should consider developing mechanisms for addressing urgent matters outside of the regular voting cycles.Delegation Programs:Moving delegation programs like the Protocol Delegation Program and Chain Delegation Program to onchain mechanisms presents an opportunity to provide stronger guarantees to stakeholders.In conclusion, the move to onchain Gov Fund execution represents a significant milestone for us, but it‚Äôs just the beginning. We‚Äôre committed to building a governance model that is not only robust and transparent but also flexible and inclusive. We look forward to engaging with the community as we embark on this exciting journey together.","Optimism is transitioning its governance fund onchain, aiming for a more sophisticated, nuanced system than typical permissionless models.  Current offchain processes, detailed in the Operating Manual, prioritize proposal quality over simple token-based thresholds to prevent spam and maintain community relevance.  Moving forward, the focus is on replicating the Manual's functionality onchain, including delegate approvals and defined voting cycles, initially for Gov Fund proposals.  Long-term goals include onchain Citizens' House voting, citizenship selection, emergency voting mechanisms, and onchain delegation programs.  This transition prioritizes a balance between decentralization and maintaining the integrity of the governance process.

Governance  Design üìê,Measuring the Concentration of Power in the Collective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/measuring-the-concentration-of-power-in-the-collective/8956,"This research analysis was conducted for the Optimism Collective as part of theFoundation Grant.TL;DRThis research report presents theConcentration of Power Index (CPI), an adapted version of the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), developed to assess the concentration of power within the Optimism Collective. By incorporating both individual delegate voting power and the influence of governance bodies - includingHouses, Councils, and Committees (HCC)- the CPI provides a detailed view of governance dynamics. The report highlights key findings on power distribution, the role of delegates, and the CPI‚Äôs ability to adjust to changes in governance structures, showing its potential to guide policy changes and support decentralization efforts.AcknowledgementWe sincerely thank the Optimism Collective for sponsoring and supporting this research. Their support allowed us to explore the governance structures within the Collective. We also want to thank@optimistic_emily&@elizaoakfor their support and guidance, which were key to our research‚Äôs success. We thank@v3naru_Curiaand the curiaLab team for their valuable data contributions wherever needed. This report could not have been completed without the collaboration of everyone involved, and we deeply appreciate their efforts. Lastly, we thank all survey participants for measuring each HCC‚Äôs influence.Team -@ARDev097@Chain_L@Mary17IntroductionThe governance structure of the Optimism Collective plays a key role in supporting decentralized decision-making and ensuring fair representation of stakeholders. However, with ongoing developments within the governance system, evaluating the concentration of power among delegates and governance bodies becomes important. This research report introduces the Concentration of Power Index (CPI), which enhances the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to provide a clearer view of power dynamics. By assessing both individual voting power and the roles of different governance bodies, the CPI aims to check for potential risks related to power concentration while promoting fair governance practices.MethodsThe research began by gathering data on delegates‚Äô voting power from Dune Analytics, offering insights into the influence of individual delegates within the Optimism Collective‚Äôs Token House. Information about the various councils and committees, including their members and responsibilities, was sourced from the Optimism Forum.To accurately measure power concentration, theConcentration of Power Index (CPI) was created to factor in both the individual voting power of delegates and their participation across multiple governance bodies, such as Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCC).This dual approach enables a more detailed assessment of power dynamics and their effects on governance within the Optimism ecosystem.Method for Measuring the Influence of Optimism Governance Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCC)The framework for measuring influence is based on several key factors, including Decision-Making Authority, Scope of Influence, Community Engagement, Operational Independence, Voting Power, and Veto Power. Each factor is weighted to reflect its significance in the overall evaluation.The governance structure comprises several Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCCs) such as the Token House, Citizens‚Äô House, and Grants Councils.The weighted score of each HCC is calculated using specific formulas:Token House:image1018√ó208 16.6 KBLikewise, the weighted scores for other HCCs are calculated using similar formulas:Method for Calculating the CPI:The CPI was determined by combining the influence of Token House delegates with other governance layers, including various Houses, Councils, and Committees. This approach provides a more comprehensive measure of power concentration within the Optimism Collective.CPI Formula:The Concentration of Power Index (CPI) is mathematically defined as follows:image1222√ó698 65.7 KBThis detailed methodology ensures that the CPI accurately captures the complex relationship between individual voting power and the collective influence of governance bodies, offering a reliable framework for analyzing power concentration within the Optimism Collective.ResultsInfluence of Governance Bodies Within Optimism CollectiveThe table accompanying this report outlines the influence of each governance body, calculated using the weighted parameter scoring method. The Citizens‚Äô House has the highest influence at 34.59%, followed closely by the Token House at 32.33%. The Grants Council (Builders & Growth Experiments Sub-committee) contributes 10.15%, while the Security Council accounts for 13.17%. Other bodies, such as the Grants Council (Milestone & Metrics Sub-committee) at 2.82%, the Code of Conduct Council at 4.32%, and the Developer Advisory Board at 3.01%, have comparatively lower influence, reflecting the distribution of decision-making authority across the different governance bodies.Governance BodyPercentage (%)Token House (Th)32.33%Citizens‚Äô House (Ch)34.59%Grants Council Builders & Growth Experiments Sub-committee (Gc)10.15%Grants Council Milestone & Metrics Sub-committee (Gc(M&M))2.82%Security Council (Sc)13.17%Code of Conduct Council (CoC)4.32%Developer Advisory Board (DAB)3.01%Concentration of Power Index (CPI) Across Different Rounds and SeasonsThe Concentration of Power Index (CPI), measured across different rounds and seasons, is shown in the graph below.The initial CPI for the Token House was 329.25.After including data from Citizen House Round 2 and the councils for Season 3, theCPI significantly dropped to 140.13 and remained stable during Season 4. With the addition of data from Season 5, the CPI further decreased to 91.81, reflecting a clear trend toward decentralization. This trend continued withCitizen House Round 3 at 81.53 and Round 4 at 80.90, highlighting the ongoing decentralization within the governance structure.874√ó547 24.9 KBHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) Across Different DAOsThe Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) values for Optimism, Compound, Aave, and Uniswap are displayed in the graph below, showing the concentration of voting power among delegates within each DAO. The HHI for Optimism was calculated using only Token House delegates, without considering other governance layers, for easier comparison. The HHI values for Compound, Aave, and Uniswap were determined based on the distribution of voting power among their respective delegates.859√ó547 24.1 KBConcentration of Power Index (CPI) Across Different DAOsThe graph below displays the CPI values for Optimism, Compound, Aave, and Uniswap, representing the concentration of power in each DAO. Optimism‚Äôs CPI of 80.90 shows a decentralized power structure, while Compound‚Äôs 320.72 and Aave‚Äôs 627.34 indicate more centralized governance. Uniswap‚Äôs CPI of 215.29 suggests a balance between decentralization and concentration but is still less decentralized than Optimism. For other DAOs, only their delegate‚Äôs voting power is considered for this comparison.859√ó547 24 KBNakamoto Coefficient Across Different DAOsThe Nakamoto Coefficient, which measures the minimum number of members needed to control over 51% of the voting power, is represented in the bar chart below for Optimism, Compound, Aave, and Uniswap. Optimism requires 21 members to surpass this threshold, indicating relative decentralization. In contrast, Compound requires 13 members and Aave only 8, reflecting a higher concentration of power. Uniswap‚Äôs Nakamoto Coefficient is 17, suggesting a decentralized power structure, though slightly more concentrated than Optimism.841√ó547 19.2 KBConclusionThe Concentration of Power Index (CPI) is a valuable tool for evaluating power distribution within the Optimism Collective. It improves on the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by considering the influence of various governance bodies, such as Houses, Councils, and Committees. The CPI highlights areas where power is concentrated among a small group of delegates, raising concerns about over-centralization, while also identifying areas where power is more evenly spread, supporting decentralization. It provides a clearer understanding of the impact of delegates involved in multiple governance roles, offering a more detailed view of decision-making power. Additionally, the CPI can adapt to changes in governance structures, allowing for real-time assessments of power dynamics. By pinpointing periods of concentrated power and successful moves toward equitable distribution, the CPI helps guide policy changes and governance improvements. Ultimately, the CPI is key to maintaining decentralization and promoting a fair, inclusive governance structure within the Optimism Collective. The temporal chart of CPI can provide the direction in which our Collective is moving in terms of centralization as CPI is modified applying the same benchmark as HHI will not be an accurate measure.image1564√ó821 80.5 KBSource:-CPI SiteResourcesDetailed Report Link -ReportFrontend Dashboard -Frontend DashboardInfluence Calculator -Influence CalculatorPresentation Link -PresentationObservation File -Observation FileBehind the Scenes Documentation -Behind the ScenesGitHub Repo -Repo Link","This research, commissioned by the Optimism Collective, introduces the Concentration of Power Index (CPI), an enhanced Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).  The CPI assesses power distribution within the Optimism Collective, considering both individual delegate voting power and the influence of governance bodies (Houses, Councils, Committees).  Findings reveal a decreasing CPI over time, indicating increased decentralization.  Comparisons with other DAOs (Compound, Aave, Uniswap) highlight Optimism's relatively decentralized structure.  The CPI's adaptability to evolving governance structures makes it a valuable tool for guiding policy and promoting fairer, more decentralized decision-making.

Governance  Design üìê,Developer Advisory Board,https://gov.optimism.io/t/developer-advisory-board/6892,"Introducing the Developer Advisory BoardDevelopers are among the Collective‚Äôs most important stakeholders as they are building the Optimism protocol and the applications on top of it. Governance of an L2, and growth of its supporting ecosystem, will require governance to make many technical decisions.For example:Intent #1, progress towards technical decentralization, is the highest priority for the Collective. Proposals under this Intent require technical expertise.Builder grants aim to increase the number of active developers deploying on Optimism. The Grants Council must make decisions that are heavily informed by the developer perspective, particularly at the application level.The Token House is tasked with evaluating high importance protocol upgrades and enforcing theLaw of Chains, both of which require high levels of technical understanding. In future Seasons, the Developer Advisory Board‚Äôs mandate may be expanded to assist delegates in assessing technical proposals.Given the need for Optimism governance to make good technical decisions, the Foundation is proposing the establishment of a Developer Advisory Board (DAB) with the below mandate.Developer Advisory Board CharterGoalsAssess and approveDelegate Mission Requestdrafts based on their technical meritsAid the Grants Council in assessing approvedDelegate Mission Requests and Mission ApplicationsunderIntent #1Advise the Grants Council in assessing the completion of technical milestonesAdvisory Board StructureThis Advisory Board is not a Council as they will serve in an advisory capacity without official decision making authority. Therefore, they will not be elected as representatives, but will rather be appointed. The initial set of members will be appointed by the Foundation. In subsequent Seasons, members will be appointed by the Grants Council.The Developer Advisory Board will not vote on proposals. However, the advisory board‚Äôs approval will be required on all Delegate Mission Requests under Intent#1. In order to provide approvals, a simple majority of advisory board members must agree that an approval has technical merit. Evaluation criteria and rubrics should be made public, when applicable. The Grants Council should also consider the Developer Advisory Board‚Äôs input on all Mission Applications under Intent#1.MembershipThe initial Developer Advisory Board will be comprised of six members and a lead, one of which will be a non-voting member of the OP Labs engineering or product team. One member of the Developer Advisory Board will be designated as the Lead to manage general coordination and operations. The Lead will be a non-voting member.  If approved, the Foundation will appoint the below members:Board Lead:BrockBoard Member:PhilogyBoard Member (forfeiting compensation):NoahBoard Member:ZachBoard Member:RomanBoard Member:JepsenOP Labs Representative (non-voting):KelvinSummary of experience and qualificationshereAll members may be removed from their positions via the Representative Removal proposal type in theOperating Manual. If a member of the Developer Advisory Board is unable to fulfil the responsibilities listed below, they may publicly step down and the Foundation (Grants Council, in future Seasons) should appoint a replacement by no later than the end of the next Voting Cycle.Future AppointmentsThe Developer Advisory Board will need to be re-appointed by the Grants Council each Season as the members of the Grants Council must be re-elected and are subject to change. As the expertise represented on the Grants Council changes, the composition of the advisory board may also need to change.Future appointees of the board should be selected considering the below qualities:Must have:history of development in the Optimism and/or Ethereum ecosystemdeep understanding of developments in the Optimism ecosystemability to dedicate sufficient time fulfilling member responsibilitiesNice to have:experience with security and or auditingexperience evaluating technical grants (examples include, but are not limited to, evaluating grants for the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, and/or other protocol grant programs)Member ResponsibilitiesReview all Delegate Mission Request drafts under Intent#1and provide feedback/reasoning if the Developer Advisory Board‚Äôs approval is NOT provided on any proposal drafts before deadlines. The Developer Advisory Board is encouraged to create a public rubric, using a rubric process similar to that of the Grants Council.Provide a statement on each approved Delegate Mission Request either affirming why it‚Äôs important or registering skepticism as to its technical merits.Work with the Grants Council to assess the merits of Mission Applications under Intent#1. The Developer Advisory Board may also assess the technical merits of Mission Applications under other Intents, but it is not required.Assess the completion of technical milestones related to Intent#1Missions and/or Mission Requests for other Intents that the Developer Advisory Board has advised the Council on.Members may also create their own Delegate Mission Requests, but are not required to do so.Members should expect to dedicate 5-8 hours per week, on average, to these responsibilities.The Advisory Board Lead should:publish the board‚Äôsinternal operating proceduresbefore the beginning of Season 5facilitate coordination of board member review and host regular board meetings, which should occur at least once per Grants Cycle (every 6 weeks.) It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the communityrun a process to ensure milestones on technical Missions have been met before milestone-based dispersements are madeexercise decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus on an administrative or operational matterAdvisory Board BudgetWe propose an initial budget of 12,500 OP per Advisory Board Member (excluding the OP Labs representative) and 20,000 OP for the Advisory Board Lead, for a total budget of 70,000 OP to be dispersed at the end of Season 5. The initial budget will be important to attract top talent, but we believe the contributions of the Developer Advisory Board are highly conducive to RetroPGF funding and recommend the board be primarily rewarded retroactively.Consistent with other reward allocations, all Developer Advisory Board rewards will be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.What does it Mean for Delegates?Delegates will need to approve the Developer Advisory Board budget and ratify its membership in Special Voting Cycle#16a. If approved, the Developer Advisory Board will have ample time to establish its internal operating procedures before the start of Season 5.","Optimism Foundation proposes a Developer Advisory Board (DAB) to enhance technical decision-making in its governance.  The six-member DAB, appointed initially by the Foundation, will advise the Grants Council, particularly on technical decentralization proposals (Intent #1).  Their approval is mandatory for Intent #1 Delegate Mission Requests.  The DAB will not vote but provide crucial technical expertise, assessed using public criteria.  Members, compensated in OP, will dedicate 5-8 hours weekly and be accountable via the Operating Manual.  Delegate approval is needed for the DAB's budget and initial membership.

Governance  Design üìê,Exploring coalitions within the Optimism Collective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/exploring-coalitions-within-the-optimism-collective/9260,"DeepDAO Pro serves as the most comprehensive source of truth of OP Collective governance. We track several metrics under different subsections for treasury, token, voter trends, delegates, coalitions, and the ecosystem of the Optimism collective (including voter interests, and competitors analysis). Our Coalitions, or Power Groups analysis is a unique offering that looks at power concentration and alignment between delegates.Coalitions are defined as groups of addresses that often vote together on proposals. Coalitions surface the interconnections between delegates, how often they vote together, and their combined governance influence. To truly understand the power dynamics within the Optimism Collective, we need to be looking at such aggregations of voting power, as well as delegates in isolation.Screenshot 2024-11-12 at 10.20.10 AM1390√ó663 77.2 KBDeepDAOcurrently tracks coalitions of up to 6 addresses. For each coalition, we define several metrics including:The number of times these addresses voted together on proposals.Their combined voting power.The number of delegators, that have given their power to all members of the coalition.Percentage of quorum they hold together.Percentage of the OP token‚Äôs circulating supply they control together.The percentage of voting power they control, relative to the voting power that was needed to win a proposal over the past 6 months.Sorting by voting power, the strongest 6-member coalition within the OP Collective is:Linda Xie (@linda) + Olimpio (@olimpio) + Synthetix Ambassadors (@MattGov.eth) - 2 addresses + Jack Anorak (@jackanorak) + Scott Moore (@ceresstation)Together, they control 12.5M $OP, representing ~44% of the quorum in recent proposals. They have voted together 27 times. Note that even the 20th most powerful 6 member coalition has over 7.7M OP delegated to them, which is considerably more than the largest independent delegate, L2Beat (@kaereste@Sinkas). Hence, to truly understand the dynamics of voting power within the Optimism Collective, the dynamics of coalitions needs to be further studied.The data tells us that:The largest coalition by voting power does not include many of the most influential delegates. In fact, none of the top 5 coalitions (by voting power) include active delegates like L2Beat (@kaereste@Sinkas), Lefteris Karapetsas (@lefterisjp), or Katie Garcia (@katie). This might represent constructive disagreement among key decision-makers.Large coalitions are becoming less active over time. In many of the top coalitions, more than 50% of members have voted in fewer than 3 of the last 10 proposals. It needs to be seen if, over the coming years, new coalitions of presently active addresses will form, or weather the nature of governance as the DAO evolves, will inherently break up coalitions due to a higher percentage of contentious proposals.Coalitions within the OP Collective are extremely powerful! The most powerful 6-member coalitions in the OP Collective hold upwards of 40% of the winning power. While in a highly centralized environment, we might expect this number to be even higher (even for coalitions of only 3 or 4 members), there is a lot of scope to improve delegate diversity and distribution of power within the collective.In conclusion, coalitions are an underexplored but critical aspect of DAO governance. Only with tools like DeepDAO Pro can we understand the true extent of decentralization and the interconnections in large DAOs like Optimism Collective. We are proud to pioneer this work and make it freely available to all participants in the Collective through theDeepDAO Pro dashboard.","DeepDAO Pro analyzes Optimism Collective's governance, offering unique insights into coalition power dynamics.  It tracks metrics for treasury, tokens, voters, and delegates, focusing on coalitions‚Äîgroups of addresses frequently voting together.  Analysis reveals that powerful coalitions, controlling significant OP tokens and voting power (e.g., the top coalition holds ~44% of quorum), often exclude prominent individual delegates.  This suggests potential for improved delegate diversity and power distribution.  DeepDAO Pro's data highlights the crucial, yet often overlooked, role of coalitions in understanding DAO decentralization.

Governance  Design üìê,The Future of Optimism Governance,https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-future-of-optimism-governance/6471,"The Optimism Foundation recently published this as apost on our Mirror blog. We‚Äôre reposting here in full for feedback and discussion from the community.The Future of Optimism GovernanceThe Optimism Collective is governed by a two-house system. The Token House is made up of OP holders and their delegates, and the Citizens‚Äô House is a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation.This two-house design is intended to help the Collective make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls in token-based governance systems. Tokenholders represent one constituency out of many, and are not always the right unilateral owners for decisions that don‚Äôt involve the economics of the system. Creating two distinct branches of governance with different membership criteria allows the Collective to match constituents‚Äô incentives with different types of decisions. It also helps the Collective avoid concentration of power, enact safeguards via checks and balances, and evaluate decisions from broader perspectives.This is not a new concept. Bi- or tri-cameral governance systems have existed for centuries. With a new iteration of a known pattern, Optimism aims to build a governance system that will stand the test of time and help the Collective flourish.This post provides an overview of the goals, design principles, and problem spaces of Optimism Governance. It is not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance processes will be introduced and implemented: it‚Äôs highly likely the Collective will learn from initial experiments and make modifications to the rules and processes outlined here. These ‚ÄúProblem Spaces‚Äù are intended as starting points for discussion.Governance GoalsThere are two primary goals of Optimism‚Äôs governance system:Capture resistance.Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Optimism protocol. Governance should (a) make it possible for chain or network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and (b) prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.Resource allocation.Governance‚Äôs second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Collective‚Äôs vision and accrue sustainable value to the Optimism Collective. Vision & value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.Design PrinciplesDesign decisions for the Collective‚Äôs governance system should be made in line with three key principles:Governance minimization. The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Collective aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of (1) onchain governance processes to upgrade Optimism contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and (2) offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.Iteration. Optimism is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the Collective through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the Collective a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance‚Äôs responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.Forking. The right to fork and the right to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms. All of the core software and tooling required to run the Optimism network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn‚Äôt just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract arewhat makes decentralized platforms valuable, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Optimism if they have the ability to make an alternative.Balance. Influence in governance must extend beyond financial stake to value humanhood and intelligent life. The centralizing force of plutocratic token governance must be balanced with Citizenship. Giving voice and power to different constituents allows the Collective to match decisions with voters‚Äô incentives, rather than building a solely plutocratic system. Checks and balances prevent capture.Impact = profit.A key part of the Optimistic Vision is to ensure that every individual is rewarded in proportion to their positive impact to the Collective. We believe this to be the most important target in the pursuit of solving global coordination problems and creating a better future. Our economy is an expression of our collective needs, wants, and ethics. Optimism Governance is ultimately responsible for enacting this fairness ratio that is key to the Optimistic Vision.Design OverviewThe responsibilities of Optimism Governance can be categorized into one of the two primary goals of the governance system:Capture ResistanceandResource Allocation. Within each category, governance responsibilities are identified as (a) the exclusive responsibility of one or the other house, (b) a responsibility where one house drives proposals and the other house may veto, or (c) as a truly shared responsibility subject to approval by each house. This system is designed to help each house play to its strengths and avoid deadlock.The OptimismToken Houseis made up of OP tokenholders and their delegates. Tokenholders and their delegates are expected to be rational economic actors interested in preserving or increasing the economic well-being of the Optimism Collective. Therefore, the Token House is responsible for decisions that affect business parameters of the system such as inflation or the variables that govern sequencer selection. Token voting is distributed widely and permissionlessly and helps represent the free market in the Collective‚Äôs decision making.In contrast to the Token House, theCitizens‚Äô Houseuses a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective: builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project‚Äôs values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. Therefore, the Citizens‚Äô House is responsible for decisions that may require prioritizing long term growth ahead of other goals ‚Äì decisions like allocating funding to public goods that support the Collective. In the long term, we can expect the Citizens‚Äô House to expand to include the thousands or millions or billions of humans interacting with Optimism.Governance responsibilities given to each house will change over time as the Collective iterates towards its long-term governance-minimized end state. This includes introducing highly manual governance responsibilities (e.g. inflation adjustments, or Superchain allowlists) that are intended to be replaced by automated smart defaults as the Collective learns how to govern these vectors appropriately. It may also include transitioning powers from the responsibility of the full governance body to a subset of governance participants who are empowered by their broader governance base.In these early chapters of Collective governance, many of these iterations have been designed or implemented by the Optimism Foundation. Eventually this must transition to the responsibility of Collective governance itself. This meta-governance power marks the end of the Foundation‚Äôs stewardship of the evolution of Collective governance and entrusts the governance community with continued experimentation towards a healthy end-state for Optimism.So: what does governance‚Ä¶ well, govern?Problem Space#1:Capture ResistanceOptimism Governance‚Äôs first responsibility is to ensure that no single party can unilaterally control, censor, halt, or otherwise extract rent from Optimism. A decentralized compute layer is hardly valuable if controlled by a centralized entity. Governance helps the Collective make decisions in the absence of any one person or organization that is ‚Äúin charge.‚ÄùThe responsibility to uphold capture resistance can be broken down into two broad categories:hard powers:governance powers that are eventually encoded and executed onchain, andsoft powers:social norms the governance community upholds, not enforced onchain but by the community‚Äôs ability to fork.1/ Hard powersProtocol Upgradesrefer to the ability for governance to make changes to the OP Stack protocol itself. This is a crucial responsibility of governance that ultimately makes the community the steward of Optimism‚Äôs core protocol functionality.Protocol upgrades will be approved by the Token House, subject to a Citizens‚Äô House veto. The Token House is the primary approver because of its broad reach and likelihood of representing business interests that depend on the OP Stack‚Äôs functionality. The Citizens‚Äô House veto power guards against capture of the Token House and increases the resilience of the overall system.Today, protocol upgrades are approved by the Token House and executed manually by the Optimism Foundation. In the coming Seasons, the Collective may implement a Security Council responsible for executing upgrades following the will of governance. The Citizens‚Äô House veto power comes online in Season 5 (H1 2023), when the Citizens‚Äô House comes fully online. Eventually, execution of protocol upgrades will be fully onchain. On a far enough time horizon, we can expect protocol upgrades to become less and less common as the protocol nears feature completeness. We can look to protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin as a model for what mature decentralized protocol upgrades look like.Sequencer Selectionis the ability to make choices about which parties may act as sequencers for OP Chains or in shared sequencing schemes.This begins as an explicit governance power driven by the Token House, with Citizens‚Äô House power to veto. Sequencers are important economic actors for OP Chains and eventually for the Superchain. The Token House is well-incentivized to make sure sequencer selection is fair and beneficial for the Collective. The Citizens‚Äô House veto power guards against the capture of the Token House related to sequencer selection.Today, OP Chains are sequenced by a handful of different entities. In Season 5, those sequencers will submit proposals to Optimism Governance to be formally included in the Superchain, officially bringing the hard power of sequencer selection into the hands of the Collective. More information about this governance process will be shared in the coming weeks.Eventually, sequencer selection may be fully automated based on verifiable and pre-agreed upon processes, enabling the sequencer set to be curated and maintained without active governance intervention.Citizenship Eligibilityis the responsibility of governance to select new humans to participate in the Citizens‚Äô House of Optimism Governance.Citizenship Eligibility will be determined by the Citizens‚Äô House; the Token House will have the power to veto. Assuming good long-term values alignment with the Collective, Citizens should be incentivized to grow a set of voters that make quality decisions about RetroPGF allocations. A Token House veto guards against capture of the Citizens‚Äô House or moves to consolidate power.To date, Citizenship expansion has been administered by the Foundation. In the future, the Foundation will propose an expansion algorithm that Citizens vote to approve. Ultimately, Citizens may govern a citizenship selection algorithm directly that runs across identity data in the Optimism AttestationStation. In its final minimized form, the Citizens‚Äô House has established a battle-tested onchain selection process; updates to the contracts that govern selection can be made as necessary by the Citizens‚Äô House.2/ Soft powersCode of Conduct Enforcementis the responsibility of governance to uphold and enforce the Optimism Collective Code of Conduct.Each house may govern the code of conduct for its own members. The best cultural and values-based enforcement for governance communities should come from within that specific community.Today, CoC violations are processed with administration from the Foundation. In future Seasons, the community will iterate on this approach: Season 4 includes anRFP for Code of Conduct research, and Season 6 may introduce a new Council to replace the Foundation‚Äôs role in this process. As a soft power, Code of Conduct enforcement will not be implemented onchain. For example, if a Token House delegate were to violate the Code of Conduct, that delegate would not be prevented from voting by an update to Optimism‚Äôs voting contracts onchain. Rather, the community could enforce its rules and norms on the social layer by choosing to remove the participant from delegation frontends and UIs, or by informing the tokenholders who‚Äôve delegated to the offending party of the breach in conduct.Director Removalis the right of governance to remove a director of the Optimism Foundation. Director Removals are approved by the Token House.This right is enforced and upheld by the Founding Documents of the Optimism Collective. As such, the Token House may vote to veto any reduction of this power. As Directors are not represented onchain, this responsibility does not have onchain enforceability.Problem Space#2:Resource AllocationThe second primary responsibility of Optimism governance is to allocate the Collective‚Äôs resources to help it achieve its goals. This is a piece of essential governance that requires human intervention, especially in its early stages. Resource allocation in the Collective comes in three forms:1/ Allocation of Protocol Revenue2/ OP Treasury Management3/ RetroPGF FundingAllocation of Protocol Revenueis the responsibility of governance to determine how to direct surplus ETH generated by the Optimism protocol. Optimism generates revenue through transaction fees paid on OP Mainnet and other OP Chains. Part of these transaction fees is used to post data to Ethereum L1 and pay for other expenses associated with running the protocol, and the remainder of the fee is accumulated as surplus revenue that can be directed by the Collective for the benefit of the Collective. In the future, the sequencing and proving networks that help run the Optimism protocol may also provide sources of revenue for the Collective.By default, surplus protocol revenue will be allocated to RetroPGF. The Token House may vote on proposals to divert a portion of the surplus protocol revenue for other Optimism Collective purposes as they see fit. These proposals will be subject to veto right by the Citizens‚Äô House.Protocol Revenue is a crucial lever in the Collective. In its early stages, the default allocation to RetroPGF lets the Collective reward projects that grow the Optimism ecosystem. As Optimism matures, the Token House is entrusted to propose deviations from this default for the health of the Optimism Collective. Citizens‚Äô House veto powers help hold the Token House accountable and prevent short term optimization at the expense of long term sustainability.In a future governance season, a proposal type will be introduced for proposing modifications to the allocation of surplus protocol revenue. These proposals may begin with certain safeguards, like a cap on possible allocations. Proposal power for high-level budgeting decisions may additionally be delegated to elected representatives as the Token House sees fit. The long term minimized state of this governance responsibility could include some thoughtful automation to determine revenue allocations based on indicators of whether the Collective should be in a ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stage or ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stage.OP Treasury Allocationis the responsibility of governance to direct how the existing OP token treasury is allocated. This has several components:TheGovernance Fund, which is directed by Token House governance.TheRetroPGF Fund, which is directed by Citizens‚Äô House governance, subject to a Token House veto.TheSeed FundandUnallocatedportions of the token treasury, which are initially administered by the Foundation, and will eventually be directed jointly by both houses.Foundation Budget Approvals, which are governed jointly by both houses.Inflation adjustments, which are governed by the Token House, subject to a Citizens‚Äô House veto.This distributed ownership of the OP Treasury allows for flexibility and gives each house a clear mechanism to allocate tokens for the development of the Collective. Today, treasury allocations are administered by the Foundation, and will gradually move onchain as the governance system matures and becomes more resilient. In the long term, as most of the Treasury is circulating, this power will boil down to the governance of inflation, which can be automated to a thoughtful set of defaults based on the economic health of the Collective.RetroPGF Grantsare the responsibility of governance to allocate RetroPGF to projects that have provided public good to the Optimism Collective. These grants may refer to either (a) OP tokens from the RetroPGF Fund portion of the token treasury (see OP Treasury Allocation), or (b) Profits generated by the Optimism Protocol that governance has decided to allocate to RetroPGF (see Allocation of Protocol Revenue). Specifically, this responsibility includes:RetroPGF Scope: the ability of governance to update the scope, metrics, and impact evaluation criteria used in determining how RetroPGF Grants are allocated to projects. In line with the principle of governance minimization, this should be a soft power.Project Allocations: the ability of the Citizens‚Äô House to make specific individual project-level decisions about how the RetroPGF Scope is applied to allocate grants. This is the corresponding hard power for RetroPGF.Both components of RetroPGF Grants above are the responsibility of the Citizens‚Äô House. Citizens are selected as individual humans who are interested in the long term health of the Optimism Collective, and RetroPGF is a long term investment in Optimism‚Äôs growth.Today, the Foundation identifies RetroPGF scope and Citizens make Project Allocation decisions. Eventually, Citizens will govern RetroPGF scope themselves.Altogether, this looks like the diagram below:3840√ó1921 572 KBAdditional NotesIncompletenessThe list above does not include all governance powers ‚Äì it notably excludes governance responsibilities, especially social ones.The list above is also not a commitment or blueprint for exactly how governance powers will be rolled out and implemented. It is highly likely that the Collective will learn from initial experiments towards this blueprint and may make modifications to the processes outlined here. These ‚ÄúProblem Spaces‚Äù are intended as starting points for discussion, not as a prescriptive roadmap.Checks, balances, and vetosThis post also excludes crucial design details about veto power, approval and quorum thresholds, proposal defaults, and failure modes. In particular, it‚Äôs important to note that all veto powers are not created equal. A very high veto threshold and quorum create a higher bar for exercising veto power, where a simple majority could make for a relatively easy veto. These thresholds determine the balance of power in responsibilities shared between houses and must be considered carefully.The Collective will apply the principle of iteration in introducing these checks, balances, and vetos. This allows time to experiment with the right settings and make sure both branches of governance are developing safely.These details are incredibly important to the design of a well-functioning system, and members of the Collective are consulting with a set of experts, from crypto and beyond, to design a quality set of patterns to increase the chances of Optimism Governance‚Äôs success. If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to these efforts, you‚Äôre welcome to reach out tobobby@optimism.ioor chime in on the governance forums.Citizenship and captureSince Citizens play a crucial role in the Optimism governance, it‚Äôs paramount that the Citizens‚Äô House is qualified and capture-resistant. Several factors come into play here, including the ways identity and contribution history can help inform citizenship eligibility; public and private voting strategies to help prevent collusion and bribery; citizenship incentives; escape hatches and metagovernance in the event of capture; and the iterative path towards growing the set of Citizens and their responsibilities. These important topics will be discussed in greater detail in a future post.Key MilestonesOptimism Governance continues to make steady strides towards a robust and sustainable system. Here are some of the next milestones for the Collective in the coming quarters:Season 5 [2024]Sequencer Allowlist / Law of ChainsSeason 5 will introduce the governance system‚Äôs power to welcome new Sequencers into the Superchain. More information about sequencer governance (and its relation to chain, user, and platform governance) will be shared in the coming weeks.Joint-House votingIn Season 5, the Collective will bring the Citizens‚Äô House fully online and execute its first set of joint-house votes. After executing three rounds of RetroPGF, this milestone will mark the next stage of maturity for the Citizens‚Äô House as they participate in Optimism Governance beyond RetroPGF grant allocations.Security Council v1Season 5 will also include the Optimism Security Council. The Security Council is a set of community members tasked with executing protocol upgrades at the will of governance. This replaces the multisig wallet controlled by the Optimism Foundation and marks an important milestone in protocol decentralization.Season 6 [2024]Protocol Revenue AllocationSeason 6 will introduce the initial process for votes to allocate Protocol Revenue. It‚Äôs possible this process will include the introduction of a Treasury Council responsible for making high-level proposals to governance about how to allocate resources; any proposal for protocol revenue allocation will be submitted to the Token House for approval, and to the Citizens‚Äô House for veto.Onchain treasury executionIn Season 6, parts of the Optimism Treasury will move onchain. This means governance will be able to initiate transactions that move tokens from the OP Token Treasury entirely onchain. As noted above, this onchain execution will begin with an emergency safeguard that will be removed in future seasons.","Optimism's governance uses a bicameral system: the Token House (OP holders) and the Citizens' House (one-person, one-vote). This design aims to prevent power concentration and capture, balancing economic incentives with broader community interests.  Two primary goals are ensuring protocol resistance to censorship and efficient resource allocation (treasury, revenue, RetroPGF grants).  Key principles include governance minimization, iterative development, and the right to fork.  The system will evolve, transitioning from Foundation-led to community-driven processes, with milestones including on-chain treasury management and a Security Council.  This bicameral approach strives for a sustainable, decentralized future for Optimism.

Governance  Design üìê,Optimism Working Models for Decentralization,https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-working-models-for-decentralization/9054,"Optimism Working Models for DecentralizationIn the recent weeks, the community has started an important conversation about the Collective‚Äôs path towards full decentralization. The Foundation remains fully committed to this transition over the course of multiple years, as originally outlined in ourWorking Constitution. We‚Äôve realized that the context gap between the Foundation and the community about this path is too wide. Below, we introduce several working models intended to narrow this gap:Decentralization Milestone Working ModelDecision Diagram Working Model(+Decision Design Framework)These working models are not intended to be roadmaps.There is an inherent trade-off between flexibility and specification. These working models are intended to preserve flexibility, and allow the community to collaborate with us in testing, adapting, and evolving these working models as we learn together. In order to provide more specificity, the Foundation will also publish governance roadmaps at the start of each Season, as part of the Intent setting process. These roadmaps will inform the portions of these working models that are prioritized in the coming Season, and these working models can help contextualize each Season‚Äôs roadmaps within the broader system and path towards decentralization.You can expect a Season 7 governance roadmap to be published alongside Season 7 Intents during the Reflection Period. This roadmap will inform the specific portions of the below working models prioritized in Season 7.Decentralization Milestone Working ModelSee thisloomfor a brief overview.Goal:Create a working model that demonstrates the Foundation‚Äôs thinking about the major decentralization milestones, their dependencies, and the work necessary to be done to move from one phase to the next. We hope this working model facilitates ongoing conversations about dependencies and better enables the community to contribute to decentralization efforts. It can also serve as a tool to hold the Foundation publicly accountable to making progress towards these milestones.Taking inspiration from L2BEAT‚Äôs ‚Äústages of decentralization‚Äùframeworkfor technical decentralization, this working model outlines the Optimism specific milestones required to achieve full decentralization (protocol, economic, and social). This model also outlines the dependencies and interdependencies preventing progression to the next phase.This is meant to be a working model for understanding the progression of decentralization within the Collective and it should evolve over time with regular discussion.We are about to complete Phase A. Phase C represents the level of maturity in which the Collective is a self-managing system that represents all 4 principles outlined in ourWorking Constitution:Governance minimizationForkabilityAnti-plutocracyImpact = ProfitMilestones will be updated as they are accomplished and we recommend re-evaluating progress towards this framework at the end of each Season. We suggest piloting this process at the end of Season 6 and updating milestones as part of the Season 7 Intent setting process.Please see the model notes and legend for additional information about this working model.Governance Decision Diagram Working ModelSee thisloomfor a brief overview.Goal:Create a working model of the full decision making surface area of Optimism governance, demonstrate how these decisions interrelate, and provide a framework for how these decisions might be designed. This diagram represents the full self-managing system described in Phase C of the decentralization milestone model. It can serve as a tool for governance participants to orient their work within the system and understand the decision making infrastructure required to bring additional responsibilities online.This working model outlines the Foundation‚Äôs view of the full governance decision space to be established by Phase C. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is not to make these decisions directly. The goal of the Foundation is to bootstrap the infrastructure and policies required to allow governance participants to effectively make these decisions. We‚Äôve open sourced ourDecision Design Framework, to inform how we approach the design of each decision module within this diagram. At a future date, we may also publish the hypothesis to be tested in the development of each decision module. With this information, we hope that contributors can better aid the Foundation in the metagovernance design of each decision module.This diagram is advisory in nature:  it provides guidance to the community on how the Foundation considers various decision pathways across the Collective, and is intended to inform - but not define - the governance community‚Äôs decision-making processes.Please see the model notes and legend for additional information about this working model.Navigating the path towards decentralization requires navigating ambiguity, uncertainty, and dynamic conditions. We hope these working models serve as a tool for the community to understand the Foundation‚Äôs approach while allowing for enough flexibility and adaptability to build a system that reflects current realities and that can withstand the test of time.As always, we‚Äôre open to your feedback on any and all of the above!","Optimism is committed to long-term decentralization, acknowledging a communication gap with its community.  Two working models‚ÄîDecentralization Milestone and Governance Decision Diagram‚Äîaim to bridge this gap.  These aren't rigid roadmaps but flexible frameworks for collaboration and adaptation, updated seasonally.  The Milestone model outlines phases of decentralization, highlighting dependencies and progress.  The Decision Diagram visualizes the complete governance structure, offering a framework for decision-making modules.  Seasonal roadmaps will prioritize aspects of these models, with Season 7's roadmap released during the Reflection Period.  The models foster transparency and community involvement in Optimism's decentralization journey.

Governance  Design üìê,The Collective Feedback Commission: The Next Iteration,https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-collective-feedback-commission-the-next-iteration/9113,"Collective Feedback Commission: The Next IterationThe Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) was piloted beginning in Season 5 as part of thepath to open metagovernance.As outlined in the Collective‚ÄôsWorking Constitution, the Foundation‚Äôs role is to bootstrap the governance system of the Collective over multiple years, gradually bringing more governance rights online until the system can manage itself.  Metagovernance refers to the ability to propose changes to the design of the governance system. Given the importance of this responsibility, metagovernance is the last governance responsibility that will be transferred to the community.The CFC serves as an experimental training ground to develop a ‚ÄúCore Governance Program‚Äù that will allow the Collective to take on metagovernance responsibilities in the future. The inspiration for this program is Core Development Programs. The goal of the CFC is to enable the Foundation to become just one of many Core Governors proposing metagovernance proposals in the future (similar to how OP Labs is just one of many Core Developers proposing protocol upgrades.)This will require a multi-year, gradual, and iterative process. The CFC began with an initial six month pilot in which members were primarily ‚Äúconsulting the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.‚Äù You can see the full pilot retrospectivehere.Based on the impact of the pilot, the Foundation has decided to continue iterating with the CFC. Iterations of the Commission will gradually increase the set of member responsibilities over time as well as increase the number of members the Commission can support.The next iteration of the Commission will launch on November 4th. Qualifying participants will be notified by October 28th and will be required to opt-in and KYC by November 1st.Please note that while we will continue the Commission, we will be postponing the launch of the open contribution path component until we have further refined the best format to accomplish the longer term goals of the Commission.

Simona Pop, a Foundation Advisor, will serve as the Commission Lead. Foundation Leads will facilitate context sharing between the Commission and the Foundation. The Commission Lead will manage Commission operations and hold the Foundation accountable to executing on this Charter.*There will be 18 eligible members. Qualification of members will based on demonstrable contributions/attestations relevant to each area of required expertise. All members must opt-in to participate. The full list will be added as a comment to this post on October 25th. The CFC is an experiment and membership models are subject to change with each iteration.We will continue to invest in the many opportunities outside the Commission for the broader community to provide feedback to the Foundation.Note: Pilot membership was determined via delegation rankings in the Token House and via demonstrable contributions in the Citizens‚Äô House. This led to a high degree of overlap between members of the CFC and other leadership roles in the Collective. The current iteration experiments with selection based on expertise. We are likely to continue experimenting with different selection methods in future iterations.Season 7 ResponsibilitiesIndividual members of the Collective Feedback Commission will:Provide feedback on early Foundation design drafts, roadmaps, frameworks, etc.Participate in broader design discussions with the Foundation via monthly meetingsProvide feedback on community authored Mission Requests to ensure they align with Season 7 Intents and/or other strategic initiativesExecute on contributions as scoped by the Foundation (members of the Design Research track will do this via Project Partnerships)Note: The Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as an input but is not obligated to incorporate any individual piece of feedback or implement the recommendations in any contribution. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission members, and may be made publicly viewable by the entire community at the end of the Commission‚Äôs term. The Foundation will provide summaries of the impact of all contributions.Foundation Track Leads will:To the best of our ability, request feedback on regular feedback cycles. Project Partnerships will be scoped with clear deliverables and deadlines.Host monthly calls with the Foundation governance design team to share context and facilitate a two-way dialogue with Commission members.Propose a selection mechanism that determines which members claim specific pieces of work, subject to simple majority approval by members at the start of the term.The Commission Lead will:Onboard new Commission members, ensuring they are familiar with the CFC‚Äôs processes, mission, and operational structure. This includes providing any necessary documentation or training to help them contribute effectively from the start.Propose the evaluation algorithm by which rewards will be distributed to individual members at the start of the term, subject to majority (51%) approval  (see ‚ÄúRewards‚Äù section below).Ensure members of each track are executing on their responsibilities in a timely manner and flag any blockers to execution to the Foundation.Facilitate feedback loops and coordination between Commission members and the Foundation, when needed, holding the Foundation accountable to this Charter.Organize regular Commission meetings, as desired by members. The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization.Authoring, or coordinating authorship, of any regularcommunication reportscirculated to the broader community.Conduct feedback survey, facilitate peer reviews, and host retrospective workshop at the end of the Commission‚Äôs term to inform the next iterationNote: Leads are operational roles, meaning they do not engage in the day-to-day activities of the team but rather manage the operations of the team. This means Leads don‚Äôt review, vote, or sign but they may exercise decision-making authority in the event that the commission cannot come to consensus on a matter (ie. serve as tie breaker). Leads may also draft any applications for impact evaluation of the Commission, although we don‚Äôt expect Retro Funding to be applicable to the Commission‚Äôs work in Season 7 (see below.)Season 7 RewardsThe CFC will be allocated 100,000 OP by the Foundation. The Commission Lead will be compensated separately, via an agreement with the Foundation. These tokens will come out of the Unallocated Portion of the treasury, managed by the Foundation, since the CFC provides a valuable service to the Foundation. We are providing these rewards as we believe the work of the Commission is difficult to evaluate retroactively and therefore the CFC‚Äôs work should not depend on being eligible for Retro Funding.  Retro Funding is best suited to evaluating measurable and permissionless impact, whereas the Commission‚Äôs work is hard to measure and is currently permissioned to members selected by the Foundation. The level of impact generated by the Commission might also be higher or lower in a given season due to factors outside the Commission‚Äôs control, such as the Foundation‚Äôs experiment design.Members will vote via simple majority to approve an evaluation algorithm, proposed by the Lead at the start of the term, via which rewards will be allocated from this budget at the end of the season.The Lead will calculate individual rewards based on the approved evaluation algorithm at the end of the Season and rewards should be allocated accordingly. The Foundation recommends a minimum 48 hour dispute window to allow members to verify the correct application of the evaluation algorithm before contacting the Foundation to deliver rewards.Season 7 SuccessNumber of new ideas proposed and implemented as a result of Commission input (> 8)% of drafts in which feedback was ranked as ‚Äúhigh value‚Äù by the Foundation (> 70%)NPS score from Foundation governance team (= > 5/7)The below measures will be used to evaluate the success of the Foundation in managing this program:Member ranking of clarity of role 8.5+ (up from 7.7/10 in v1)Member ranking of clarity of responsibilities 9+ (up from 7.6/10 in v1)Member ranking of Commission efficacy 8.5+ (up from 6.9/10 in v1)","The Collective Feedback Commission (CFC), a metagovernance experiment, enters its second iteration on November 4th.  Building on a six-month pilot, this iteration refines the collaborative process between the Foundation and community members, divided into three expert tracks (Optimization, Organizational, Design Research).  Eighteen members will provide feedback on governance design, with increased agency and specialization compared to the pilot.  The CFC aims to foster shared understanding and improve Foundation processes, eventually enabling community-led metagovernance.  Success will be measured by implemented ideas, feedback value, member satisfaction, and clarity of roles and responsibilities.  A 100,000 OP reward pool incentivizes participation. The open contribution path is postponed to focus on core workstream refinement.

Governance  Design üìê,Collective Feedback Commission Pilot Retrospective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-feedback-commission-pilot-retrospective/8970,"Collective Feedback Commission Pilot RetrospectivePilot Recap6 months ago, we piloted aCollective Feedback Commission(CFC) as the first step in outlining apath towards open metagovernance.  The primary role of the Collective Feedback Commission during this pilot was to formalize a previously informal process of collecting feedback from engaged community members by‚Äúconsulting the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.‚ÄùWe simultaneously drove efforts to solicit more feedback from the broader community, via polls and open workshops, so that feedback opportunities remain open to anyone and are not restricted to the Commission.We also experimented with additional engagement opportunities, such as asking the Commission to draft Mission Requests under Intent#1:Progress towards decentralization, governance.The Commission was divided into two groups:Token House: provided feedback on early design drafts related to Season 6, vision, and roadmapsCitizens‚Äô House: provided feedback on early design drafts related to Rounds 4-6, vision, and roadmapsYou can see the hub where feedback was provided here [link to be provided shortly], which includes Foundation statements as to how the feedback was incorporated into designs.The Commission is rewarded, in line with Impact Level 4 of theCollective Rewards Framework, but is also eligible to apply to Round 6: Governance.Pilot GoalsOne of the Foundation‚Äôs main goals with this pilot was to improve Season/Round designs relative to what we would have designed without Commission input. We can safely say that was accomplished. More concretely, at the start of the pilot, we identified the following measures of success:Number of design parameters we change based on member feedback (goal: > 5)This was actually 30Number of new ideas proposed and implemented (ideas that we hadn‚Äôt previously thought of) (goal: > 3)This was actually 8These are imprecise measures. A better metric would have been the percentage of feedback the Foundation ranked as ‚Äúhigh value‚Äù or an NPS score of the Foundation governance team rating feedback utility.Additional Foundation goals were related to decentralization:Create transparency around an informal process and create objective criteria for participating in this processBegin to create a program to develop best in class governance designers that can become mentors to othersThe ultimate goal as the Commission evolves is to reduce dependency on the Foundation as the sole governance designer of the Collective. The measure for success in this state would be the ability to ship Seasons/Rounds without the Foundation‚Äôs involvement. This will require us to gradually increase the responsibilities of Commission members over time (multiple years, likely) as well as to increase the number of members the Commission supports. The inspiration for this program is Core Development Programs. We‚Äôre excited to continue iterating towards a Core Delegate Program as metagovernance is one of most important responsibilities in the Collective. In this future, the Foundation will become just one of many Core Delegates proposing metagovernance proposals.What The Foundation Learned During the PilotNote: These are observations and learnings from the Foundation. You can see an overview of the Commission‚Äôs own retrospective workshophere.Based on the success of the initial pilot, and engagement of members, we plan to continue the Commission into its next iteration. Below we outline learnings from the pilot, which will inform the next iteration.Expectation Setting:We should have done a kickoff call to level set on the expectations/scope of the Commission in the initial pilot. We thought an asynchronous kick-off would be appreciated by busy Commission members but we later realized this was a missed opportunity to clearly define the goals and success metrics of the pilot.This was also reflected in member survey responses indicating only a moderate level of clarity on Commission goals and responsibilities (seefigma.)Reducing the context gap:We need to do a better job of sharing all context related to specific governance components in order for members to provide high value feedback. We are working to close the gap between the context the Foundation has and the context the Commission, and broader community, has. To this point, we also believe the Commission can play a better role in helping us optimize and execute processes members have first hand experience with, rather than opining on higher level or more abstract concepts.During the Retrospective workshop, members indicated they needed more context to understand how the things they were reviewing fit into the larger system and/or roadmap design.Closing the loop:The Foundation initially didn‚Äôt close the loop on how we used and implemented feedback. The Foundation was incorporating feedback but members didn‚Äôt have insight into exactly how or when their suggestions were being implemented. Member feedback allowed us to course correct at the mid-way point of the pilot.Timing:The intent was always to ask for feedback earlier enough in the design process that we could alter designs based on member input. However, this requires us to move our internal planning processes forward more than we anticipated. Round 4 and 5 feedback timelines were a bit tight as a result.During the Retrospective workshop, members suggested regularly scheduled feedback cycles and periodic synchronous calls to establish a regular workflow.Trial and error:We learned a little bit about what types of engagement with the Commission are the most effective:Feedback from Commission members on early design drafts was extremely usefulAsking the Commission to author Mission Requests didn‚Äôt work well. Citizens‚Äô House Commission members in particular did not feel that writing Missions Requests, which are approved in the Token House, aligned well with their set of responsibilities as expressed by LauNaMu below.image (7)882√ó242 198 KBDuring the retrospective workshop, Commission members expressed an interest in providing feedback on Mission Request drafts, dividing work into areas of focus, and more two-way dialogue with the Foundation team in the next iteration.Collaboration:More collaboration between members of both Houses was desired. We initially separated the groups to reduce spam in the telegram but later realized this created siloed conversations about things that pertained to both groups and made coordination on joint efforts (such as Retro Funding applications) more difficult.These are observations and learnings from the Foundation. You can see an overview of the Commission‚Äôs own retrospective workshophere.Initial Thoughts on the Next IterationThe initial pilot was an MVP test. The next iteration will convert the Commission into a persistent structure, complete with a Charter and Lead.The Foundation will host a kickoff call to level set expectations, goals, and how success will be measured in Season 7.The Commission will be closely consulted on the Foundation‚Äôs 2025 planning process as we further transition this to a Collective process.The Foundation will dedicate more resources to manage this program with the proper level of care and attention. A Commission Lead will help better support operations.We will be postponing the launch of the open contribution path component of the Commission until we have further refined the best approach to accomplish longer term goals of the Commission. It is one full workstream to design how the Commission works and another workstream to create a contribution path that supports it. We are still committed to supporting this path, but need to focus our efforts on the refinement and development of the core workstream first. We will open source the Commission‚Äôs pilot workspace shortly, which will allow all community members to have full insights into the work that was done and the feedback that was given.The membership criteria will likely change in the next iteration. Current members of the Commission may or may not re-qualify. We are very grateful for pilot member‚Äôs contributions, but in an effort to optimize transparent membership criteria, we cannot guarantee that everyone will re-qualify.More about how we envision the Commission evolving over time will follow in a post outlining how the next iteration of the Commission will operate. Launch is expected to be in early November.","A six-month pilot of a Collective Feedback Commission (CFC) significantly improved Season/Round designs, exceeding goals by implementing 30 design changes and 8 new ideas based on member feedback.  The pilot formalized feedback collection, increasing community involvement through polls and workshops.  While successful, improvements are needed: clearer initial expectations, better context sharing for members, improved feedback loop closure, and more efficient timing.  The next iteration will establish a permanent CFC with a charter and lead, enhanced resource allocation, and refined membership criteria.  The open contribution path will be deferred, focusing first on core functionality.  The pilot's workspace will be open-sourced.

Governance  Design üìê,Season 6: Chain Delegation Program Amendment,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-chain-delegation-program-amendment/8125,"Special thanks to@brichis,@kaereste, and@Porter_Smithfor review and feedback on these amendments as part of theFeedback CommissionSeason 6: Chain Delegation Program AmendmentChain Delegation Program AmendmentThe Chain Delegation Program was not utilized in Season 5 due to longer than expected timelines on the partnership side and due to the ongoing evolution of what it means to be part of the Superchain. However, the Chain Delegation Program is expected to play a meaningful role in our plans to onboard the next ~15 OP Chains. Below we propose an amendment to the original proposal, based on changes that have occurred over the course of Season 5. This program pertains only to L2‚Äôs as governance controls protocol parameters at the L2 level.OP Chains that meet the below criteria will be eligible for 250k OP in delegation:In theSuperchain Registry(or similar)Committed to contribute revenue back to the Collective and generating > 1 ETH / month in sequencer revenue, for at least 2 consecutive monthsAdditionally, chains the meet the below requirement will be eligible for an additional 750k OP in delegation:1M in transaction volume per month, for at least 2 consecutive months (qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on this metric at the beginning of each Season.) This metric more closely ties to private grant milestones, replacing the previous revenue generation metric (in part due to the impact of 4844).Chains operating on the Standard Configuration would be eligible for an additional 500k OP in delegation (a total of 1.5M OP for these chains.)Qualifying Chains will be re-assessed on these metrics at the start of each Season.The size of the program would be increased to 20M, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation. All delegation formulas and caps remain the same.The duration of the program would be extended, to support the first ~15 OP Chains in their first year of governance participation, on a rolling basis until, all qualifying chains have gone through the program.All delegations made through this program will be capped at the point at which an OP Chain reaches 3M in delegation (including Partner Fund grants able to be delegated), at the time of opt-in.No delegations have been made through this program to date. Any delegations that are made will be noted as a comment to this forum post.OP Chains will not be added to this program until they opt-in and verify they are able to uphold the below participant expectationsOP Chains must maintain a >70% voting participation rate during the Season, calculated at the start of each Season, or their delegation will be removed at the start of the next SeasonDelegates should set an ENS Primary Name to their delegation address and create a delegate statement onvote.optimism.io. It is also recommended to set an ENS avatar with the logotype of the OP Chain.Chain delegates should identify a point of contact that will be responsible for this delegation. It is recommended that this delegate attend community governance calls, hosted bi-weekly.Chain delegates will be top 100 delegates, which mean they are eligible to provide approvals on proposal drafts and should be active in the governance forums.The new program charter, updated with the above changes, can be viewed in its entiretyhere.What Does it Mean for Delegates?The proposed amendments to the Chain Delegation Program will go to a vote in Special Voting Cycle#23a. You can see the full details in theSeason 6 Reflection Period Guide. If the amendments are not approved, the Chain Delegation Program will continue to through the end of Season 6, as approved in the original proposal.In either case, the Chain Delegation Program will continue to be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund through the end of Season 6.","The Optimism Chain Delegation Program, inactive in Season 5, is amended to onboard ~15 new OP Chains.  Eligible L2s receive 250k OP for Superchain Registry registration and >1 ETH/month sequencer revenue (two consecutive months).  An additional 750k OP is awarded for 1M+ monthly transaction volume, and 500k OP more for standard configuration, totaling 1.5M OP. The program's funding increases to 20M OP, with a rolling duration until all qualifying chains participate, capped at 3M OP per chain.  Delegates must maintain >70% voting participation and meet other engagement requirements.  The amended program will be voted on in Special Voting Cycle #23a; otherwise, the original proposal continues.

Governance  Design üìê,Exploring Shielded Voting: Enhancing Governance on Optimism,https://gov.optimism.io/t/exploring-shielded-voting-enhancing-governance-on-optimism/8779,"Hey Optimism Collective!I wanted to start a conversation about a topic that‚Äôs been on my mind lately:shielded voting.For those unfamiliar with the concept,shielded votinginvolves encrypting votes during the voting period and decrypting them only after the vote closes. This approach can bring several interesting benefits to our governance processes:Mitigates Bandwagon Effects: By hiding votes until the end, shielded voting prevents people from being influenced by early voting trends. This could encourage more independent and thoughtful decision-making.Reduces Voter Apathy: When voters know their vote counts equally, regardless of when they cast it, they might feel more motivated to participate.Prevents Last-Minute Strategic Voting: With shielded voting, there‚Äôs no way to game the system by casting a vote at the last minute to sway the results.While shielded voting sounds promising, I‚Äôm curious to hear from you all:Could shielded voting improve our decision-making processes in Optimism?Are there potential downsides or challenges we should consider?Should shielded voting be applied to all proposals or only to specific ones, like elections?How could we implement this in a way that aligns with Optimism‚Äôs values and goals?Your thoughts, concerns, and ideas are all welcome. The more perspectives we have, the stronger our governance can become.Looking forward to hearing what you all think!","Shielded voting, encrypting votes until tallying, offers potential improvements to Optimism's governance.  By concealing individual choices until voting concludes, it mitigates bandwagon effects, reduces voter apathy, and prevents last-minute strategic voting.  However, implementation requires careful consideration of potential downsides and challenges.  The discussion should address applicability to all or specific proposals, ensuring alignment with Optimism's values.  Broad participation and diverse perspectives are crucial for successful implementation.

Governance  Design üìê,Introducing the Collective Feedback Commission,https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863,"Introducing the Collective Feedback CommissionThe Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective‚Äôs governance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, and facilitated by the Foundation, based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point that the Foundation becomes just one of many ‚ÄúCore Delegates‚Äù proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance).As outlined inThe Path to Open Metagovernance,the path to open metagovernance will occur gradually over multiple phases.To date, we‚Äôve been primarily inPhase 0: community informed design.The Optimism Foundation open-sources our internal research and proposes designs based on active feedback from governance participants. We receive feedback on late-stage drafts from high-context stakeholders informally, usually after designs are complete.Now we are ready to start enteringPhase 1: Community consulted design process.That means will we continue open-sourcing more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community to build shared context while also consulting community members earlier in the design process.We will do this via two primary mechanisms:Frequent polls on low-context design parameters, open to any community member‚Äôs input.Higher context feedback requested of an experimental Collective Feedback Commission. The Commission mostly formalizes what has, to date, been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants such as Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) recipients.Please note all existing avenues for community feedback will remain in place, allowing any member of the community to share their input for incorporation by the Foundation, as always. The goal of Phase 1 is to bring more people into the design process, not keep anybody out. The Feedback Commission is an addition to the existing feedback channels, not a replacement for any of them.Collective Feedback Commission (CFC)The Collective Feedback Commission will consult the Foundation on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context.The Collective Feedback Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high-context delegates, selected based on the qualifying criteria outlined below:10 highly engaged Citizens have been selected based on their contributions, specifically as they relate to governance design, in Retro Funding Rounds 2 & 3:Carl Cervone@ccerv1LauNaMu@LauNaMuSpencer@spengrahLefteris@lefterisjpMatt StephensonJoan@joanbpAmy Jung@amyRev Miller@revmillerSarah Allen@sarahaGriff Green@GriffAll (Season 5) Council/Board/Commission Leads qualify to participate:Alisha.eth@AlishaTeresa@teresacdBrichis.eth@brichisGonna.eth@Gonna.ethBrock@brockelmoreThe top 10 disclosed Token House delegates, as per Agora on 3/6/23 (end of Voting Cycle#19) qualify to participate:a16zL2BEATs@kaereste@SinkasLinda Xie@lindaPolynya@polynyaOlimpio@olimpioGFX Labs@GFXlabsLefteris@lefterisjpSNX Ambassadors@MattGov.eth@mastermojo@MoneyManDougScott Moore@ceresstationJack Anorak@jackanorakHow it WorksAll CFC members must opt-in to participate.Any open positions as a result of someone choosing not to opt-in will remain unfilled. There is no official resignation policy as resigning members will not be replaced. The Foundation will reach out to qualifying members with additional information.Opt-in forms must be completed by March 31st.We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period of 6 months, beginning April 1st, 2024. That means Token House delegates will consult on the design of Season 6. Citizens will consult on the design of Round 4 and Round 5.It is expected that CFC members will spend an average of 5 hours per Round/Season providing feedback. The CFC will be allocated 750 OP per Token House member and 1,500 OP per Citizens‚Äô House member by the Foundation. The Feedback Commission is also a good candidate for Retro Funding in Round 6: Governance Contributions.Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other Commission members, but may eventually become viewable by the entire community via a read-only public channel.Please note that the Foundation will use feedback from Commission members as an input into designs but is not obligated to incorporate any individual piece of feedback or idea.As outlined inThe Path to Open Metagovernance, there will be multiple phases in the transition to community led metagovernance. The Commission is part of Phase 1, and may evolve into a metaNERD contribution path in later phases, open to anyone who completes the required training or steps required to participate.","The Optimism Foundation is transitioning governance of the Optimism Collective to the community.  Phase 1 introduces a Collective Feedback Commission (CFC), comprising engaged citizens and delegates, to provide early feedback on governance designs.  The CFC, a six-month trial starting April 1st, 2024, supplements existing feedback channels, not replacing them.  Members (selected based on criteria outlined) will receive OP compensation for approximately 5 hours of work per round/season.  The Foundation will consider CFC feedback but retains final design decisions.  The CFC‚Äôs role may evolve in future governance phases.

Key areas explored include identifying obstacles to participation, evaluating suitable KPIs (e.g., delegate diversity), and avoiding perverse incentives.  The survey considers various reward types (OP tokens, POAPs, NFTs, attestations), distribution methods (small rewards vs. raffles), and  metrics for program success.  Community input will inform the design of a community-led incentive program.

Governance  Design üìê,GovNFT and Governance Participation Curriculum,https://gov.optimism.io/t/govnft-and-governance-participation-curriculum/8310,"GovNFT Pilot ProgramHi Everyone,The purpose of this post is to seek feedback on a general curriculum for participation in Optimism Governance.Specifically, this curriculum will be used to create incentive-based activities for GovNFT holders as part ofthis grant. The goal is to design a ‚Äúcurriculum‚Äù for the best way for new governance participants to engage in meaningful governance activities, which can hopefully be expanded in the future.What are GovNFTs?GovNFTs are a general-purpose governance primitive built by the Velodrome team. As many of you know, tokens for builders‚Äô grants have a 1-year lock. Delegations have been made on these locked tokens in the past but require manual work from the foundation to do so. GovNFTs are an audited smart contract that can keep the tokens ‚Äúlocked‚Äù while at the same time allowing the builder to fluidly participate in Optimism Governance.What is this program?To test this primitive before expanding to the broader set of Optimism builder‚Äôs grantees, we are creating a pilot program as outlined inthis grant. This pilot program makes available 25K OP to incentivize and reward existing GovNFT holders for valuable participation in Optimism governance. The initial set of users is 200+ users and protocols who have previously earned GovNFTs through previous grants on Velodrome. A series of activities will be assigned a point value. The 25k OP will be distributed among participants in the pilot based on a weighted average of points. The activities and their potential point values are as follows.This is a draft; the goal is to improve the following based on feedback from the community. If you have any ideas for changing or adding activities, please outline them in this thread.Incentivized Activities:DelegationDelegate to an active delegate on-chain (3 points)Post in a program-specific ‚Äúdelegate selection thread‚Äù and answer the following questions on why you chose that delegate (12 points)Example questionsWhat delegate did you choose?Why do you think this is a good delegate?In what ways is this delegate aligned with you?What about their delegate profile/statement do you like?What is this delegate‚Äôs voting percentage in the last 10 votes?Forum ParticipationMake a thoughtful post in our ‚Äúbi-weekly governance topic thread‚Äù (6 points)This thread will be created every two weeks by the GovNFT champion and cover a current topic in governance.The idea is that it is a governance ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù for this pilot to avoid spam in other threads, however, all governance community members are encouraged to participate.‚ÄúSpam‚Äù responses as judged by the GovNFT Champion will have 6 points deducted.The most thoughtful response in each thread, as judged by the GovNFT Champion, will be awarded an additional 20 points.Community CallsAttend a community call (10 points)Post in a program-specific GovNFT thread after the call (10 points)Becoming a DelegateThis path will only be available to those who already have 7,500 OP or more in their GovNFT.Tasks:Post a delegate statement (25 points)Delegate to yourself (15 points)Introduce yourself in a community call (25 points)Vote in an election cycle (25 points)Guiding PrinciplesIdeally, the activities outlined directly contribute to the governance intents of Season 6 and also Season 5, such as meaningfully driving delegation and distribution of votable supply among a broad set of specific stakeholders, increasing the delegated supply of OP, and increasing the average OP voted per governance proposal.We explicitly want to disincentivize any low-effort behavior that would reduce the quality of discussion on the forums. For that reason, much of the forum participation outlined above is based on participation in program-specific threads.We also want to keep in mind the potential for these activities to become a template for new participants in governance. For example, a new builder in the ecosystem may receive a builder‚Äôs grant. They can use the activities outlined above as a guide for the best way to get started in governance.I‚Äôm looking forward to your feedback!Michael","This post proposes a pilot program using GovNFTs (governance tokens) to incentivize Optimism governance participation.  25,000 OP will reward 200+ users for activities like delegating votes, engaging in forum discussions (in dedicated threads to maintain quality), attending community calls, and (for those with sufficient OP) becoming delegates.  Points are awarded for various tasks, aiming to increase delegation, voting, and thoughtful community engagement.  Feedback is sought to refine the program's activities and point system before wider implementation.  The goal is to create a model for onboarding new governance participants.

Governance  Design üìê,How do you feel about a Conflict Committee,https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-do-you-feel-about-a-conflict-committee/3117,"As of now, OPerating manual does not have any guideline on handling conflict of interest and I want to hear your opinion on this.Challenge:-Lets say a project feels that an entity is voting against their proposal or giving someone a favor for some reason.They can raise their voice but once voting is done, no one can do anything and foundation will act on the final result.What if some one feels that I am acting and voting unethically.Again, we dont have any thing in OPerating manual on how to handle this.What to do if I see biasI would appreciate if we can discuss this on this forum but what if other party is not willing to listen.Suggestion:-Create a committee to handle such scenario, we can reach out to this committee with these type request and their decision would be final.Who Would be on this committee:-Person/Team raising the request will choose 2 person*Other party involved, if chooses to, can also choose 2 personOne delegate(for simplicity we will keep any delegate with 0.5% voting power) and one OP CitizenHow I see it in work:-3 out of 4 vote is needed to reach final decision.Keeping it small will help the committee would be trivial at initial stepsIt is MANDATORY to have OP Citizen in this committee.Challenge:-Generally, I am not a big fan of creating many committee as I believe this makes things complicated and increase bureaucracy. But as we are doing and learning things iteratively, I am in favor of this. We should try and see how things works out, if not needed, we can decommission this committee.Happy to hear your thoughts on this.Edit:-1Adding some context with an example.I submitted a proposal and was voted by Token House but I am not happy with how X entity has voted on my proposal. So, here i will invoke the Conflict committee and submit my case.Token house is and will be deciding pillar, what will change, if the Conflict committee approve my request,onlyvote of X will be removed from the final result. Votes and result from rest of the Token will still apply. We are not over-riding Token house, we are just removing conflict.","The current operating manual lacks conflict-of-interest guidelines, prompting a proposal for a Conflict Committee.  This committee, composed of two members chosen by the complainant, two optionally by the opposing party, a delegate, and an OP Citizen, would adjudicate disputes regarding biased voting.  A 3/4 majority is required for a decision, primarily removing the offending vote, not overruling the Token House.  While acknowledging potential bureaucracy, the committee is suggested as a temporary, iterative solution to address unethical behavior and ensure fair governance.

In Season 6, we‚Äôll pause to reflect and refine these programs, optimizing them to support strategic goals for the Superchain. Throughout Season 6, we also aim to provide more transparency into key milestones for transferring more control over the governance system to the community via various public roadmaps.These proposals are based on 100‚Äôs of pieces of feedback documented by the Foundation throughout the Season, reports and analysis conducted by the community, periodic feedback surveys, public feedback threads, theCollective Feedback Commission,retrospectivesconducted by community representatives, etc.IntentsIntents are high level strategic goals the entire Collective works towards. Each Intent has a target metric indicating what success looks like for each Intent.Season 5:Intents applied to the entire Collective but specified that the Governance Fund was only meant to support OP Mainnet. The Foundation set 3 out of 4 Intents, and the community set Intent#3:Improve the Consumer Experience.Season 6:The Foundation will propose all Intents, which will now be ratified by governance. Intents will apply to the entire Collective.

In Season 5, it only encompassed technical decentralization.Developer Advisory Board Renewal (DAB):The Developer Advisory Board was created to help the Collective evaluate technical decisions.Season 5:The DAB reviewed all technical Missions under Intent#1(Progress Towards Technical Decentralization) and helped the Grants Council assess any technical milestones.Season 6:If renewed, the DAB will help the Grants Council assess all technical grants and milestones. They will also provide plain english explanations of all protocol upgrades and be required to provide 1/4 delegate approvals on Protocol Upgrade drafts.Anticapture Commission Amendments (ACC):The anticapture commission was created to empower a group of high context delegates with 10M OP in delegation with the mandate to inform the Citizens‚Äô House of any capture in the Token House.Season 5:The anticapture commission was delegated 10M OP in delegation to counter the voting power of other large stakeholder groups (investors, OP Chains, etc.) and mandated to prevent capture in the Token House.Season 6:The ACC was initially authorized through the end of Season 6. To date, the ACC‚Äôs primary impact has been in pushing the Foundation (a key stakeholder in the Collective) to provide more transparency into technical governance parameters and to reduce our control over those parameters. Governor Upgrades require governance approval as a result of these efforts. Amendments are proposed to make minor changes based on learnings in Season 5.Code of Conduct Rescoping:The Code of Conduct has been rescoped multiple times since the end of Season 4, based on continuous learnings.

Governance  Design üìê,Season 6: Anticapture Commission Amended,https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-anticapture-commission-amended/8132,"Season 6: Anticapture Commission AmendedThis is an amended version of the originalAnticapture Commission Charterapproved in Season 5. This will become the authoritative Charter in the case theSeason 6 proposed Amendmentis approved.Season 5 introduced an Anticapture Commission, comprised of high impact delegates. The Anticapture Commission has the below mandate (refined.)The Anticapture Commission exists to prevent capture of the Token House by any one stakeholder or group of stakeholders (protocols, OP Chains, etc.).Please note this commission‚Äôs duties are in service to tokenholders. The commission may not explicitly limit tokenholder power and may not limit the rights of tokenholders in favor of any other stakeholder group in any way.We have run or proposed similar delegation programs in the past. The Protocol Delegation Program and recently proposed Chain Delegation Program are similarly temporary delegation programs aimed at increasing the representation of important tokenholder groups. The Anticapture Commission is delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund through Season 6. At the end of Season 6, the Anticapture Commission would need to propose any continuation of the program to Governance, but the intention is for this program to expire.Anticapture Commission CharterGoalsProvide alerts to the Citizens‚Äô House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders using the process outlinedhere. Please note any member of the community may flag a concern to be considered by the anticapture commission via the commission‚Äôs email.Vote on all proposals that are subject to a Citizens‚Äô House veto. The Commission is not expected to cast votes on all proposals but exercising the Commission‚Äôs delegation is important to passing Protocol Upgrades, and any other proposals subject to Citizens‚Äô House veto.While not required, the Commission may also chose to:Advocate for the continued decentralization of governance infrastructure and processes, so no one party exercises undue influence over the system.Research, analyze, and advocate for transparency related to the distribution of voting power.Commission StructureThe Anticapture Commission would be comprised of high impact delegates (delegates meeting the membership criteria outlined below). Anticapture Commission votes would be cast based on a simply majority of individual member votes, unless the Commission Internal Operating Procedures stipulate otherwise.MembershipMembership will be determined based on the below criteria at the beginning of each Season.Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporationMembers, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegatesANDMaintain = > 70% voting participation over the previous Season (including the following Reflection Period.) This requirement has been simplified to ensure delegates have enough context without overcomplicating criteria.Have received retro rewards for governance participation in any Season.All qualifying members must opt-in to be part of the Commission. Any qualifying member may choose not to opt-in for any reason. If less than 50% of qualifying members choose not to opt-in before the start of Season 5, the Commission may be reconsidered.Please note: All members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture CommissionMember ResponsibilitiesIn exchange for being entrusted with additional voting power, Anticapture Commission members will be expected to:Members will be expected to vote on 70% of all ACC votes expected to be cast in the Token House. Last season, participation requirements were underspecified. If a Member does not meet this expectation, they will not be eligible to be on the Anticapture Commission the following Season. This is in line with the voting participation requirements of top delegates and all delegation programs in the Collective.It is recommended, but not required, that members attend internal meetings and/or community office hours, as appropriate. Members that cannot attend should provide async feedback on drafts or meeting notes.It is recommended, but not required, for members to make best efforts to provide feedback on and/or contribute to authorship of any reports circulated to the Citizens‚Äô House.Members may designate other leadership roles amongst themselves as necessary/desiredMembers will receive group delegation, but not OP rewards, for their participation on the Anticapture Commission. However, meeting the criteria required to be part of the Anticapture Commission may be included in the qualification criteria forretro delegate rewardsMembers must elect a Commission Lead each Season, by simple majority vote among qualifying membersThe Anticapture Commission Lead should:Qualify to be a member of the Anticapture CommissionOrganize regular commission meetings. It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the community. The frequency of internal meetings is at the discretion of the Commission Lead but should be aligned with governance minimization.Coordinate the execution of votes from the delegation wallet (possibly via a commission snapshot space)Author, or coordinate authorship, of any reports circulated to the Citizens‚Äô House, according to the process outlinedhere. A report must have 4 delegate approvals from commission members to be considered valid.Exercise decision-making authority in the event that the commission cannot come to consensus on a matter (ie. serve as tie breaker)","Season 6 amends the Anticapture Commission Charter, tasked with preventing any single stakeholder from dominating the Token House.  Composed of top 100 delegates with 70%+ voting participation and prior retro rewards, the commission receives 10M OP.  Its duties include alerting the Citizens‚Äô House to power imbalances, voting on veto-able proposals, and advocating for decentralized governance.  Members must meet stringent participation requirements (70% of ACC votes),  elect a lead, and may choose to further contribute through reports and meetings.  The commission's continuation beyond Season 6 requires Governance approval.

Governance  Design üìê,The Path to Open Metagovernance,https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728,"The Path Towards Open Metagovernance DesignThe Optimism Foundation stewards the development of the Optimism Collective‚Äôs governance system. The process by which the Collective takes on more responsibility for the system is iterative, facilitated by the Foundation based on community feedback. The Collective will gradually take on more governance responsibilities over time until the full system is maintained and managed by the Collective. It is at this point the system‚Äôs design must be adaptive, with the Foundation just one of many contributors proposing design changes to the system (metagovernance.)We‚Äôve heard your feedback regarding more transparency and involvement in the path towards open metagovernance design. This post outlines our current approach to governance design as well as an experimental path to community led metagovernance design.Overview of Governance Design (Illustrative)Untitled2265√ó1348 115 KBHypothesis: Based on learnings, community feedback, and/or internal milestones (4), a hypothesis is developed for how a change in governance design could help us further achieve our governance system design goals (to be open sourced at a later date.)A hypothesis is informed by a number of factors, including governance goals & design requirements that have been identified following our governance design process (to be open sourced at a later date.)Experiment: The hypothesis is tested via a time-bound, and ideally isolated, experiment  (if/when possible).Measure & Analyse: The performance of the experiment is analysed and measured. Right now, much of this occurs qualitatively (via surveys, informal feedback, retrospectives, etc.) but we strive to incorporate more quantitative measures as the system evolves.Learnings & Iteration:Based on the synthesis of qualitative feedback from governance participants and analysis (3), the hypothesis is proven/disproven. Learnings are then documented and shared, informing new hypotheses.Community involvement in Governance DesignUntitled (2)2265√ó1901 203 KBHypothesis: Hypotheses are developed using several inputs that feed into our governance design process, which is informed by our design principles and the full context of the design goals of the governance system.Inputs include:Learnings from previous cycles (4)Community ideasThe Foundation‚Äôs governance milestones and goalsThe Foundation uses these inputs to develop a hypothesis and proposes an experiment to test it; these hypotheses may come directly from community members.The proposed hypothesis and experiment are published to the forum and governance participants provide feedback.Examples:Guide to Season 5,Retro Funding 3 Round Design,Moving to a Grants CouncilExperiment: (If possible) The hypothesis is tested via a time bound, and ideally isolated, experiment.The Foundation will propose an experiment to be run for the length of a round or Season. Sometimes a longer trial period is proposed. Subsequent extensions are subject to governance renewal, following retrospectivesExample:Protocol Delegation Program RenewalExperiments are tested on the smallest scale practical to startExample: The concept of aCode of Conduct Councilis being tested only in the Token House, before any possible extension to the Citizens‚Äô HouseMeasure & Analyse: The performance of the experiment is measured and analysed.There are several sources of feedback that inform (3)Community-led Quantitive Analyses: The community leverages quantitive data to analyse the performance of the experimentExample:Retro Funding Voting SimulationsCommunity Sourced Qualitative Feedback: The Foundation conducts feedback surveys to evaluate all programs; Councils, Boards, and Commissions must conduct retrospectives at the end of their terms; informal feedback is documented by the Foundation and collected on an ongoing basis viafeedback threadsExample: During Retro Funding 3, the Foundation documented 300+ pieces of feedbackFoundation Measurements against Desired Outcomes: The Foundation aims to share these ahead of experiments this year as we‚Äôve hired a Research and Experiments Lead to bring more rigour to this part of the processLearnings & Iteration: Based on the synthesis of step (3), the hypothesis is proven/disproven.Learnings are documented and sharedExample:Retrospective on Retro Funding 3,Retrospective on Missions v1The Foundation develops new hypotheses based on these learnings, utilising our governance design process, informed by theDAO Design Principlesand our governance design goalsThe Path to Open MetagovernanceThe Foundation‚Äôs approach is to develop the governance system gradually, learning and adapting over time. The path to open metagovernance will, similarly, occur gradually over multiple phases. The phases outlined below are likely to change in accordance with our design process. Even so, open sourcing this outline is itself an important step towards Phase 1 (below).Phase 0 (Current state):Community informed design processThe Optimism Foundation proposes designs based on active input from governance participants, as outlined in the graphic above.Examples:  Token House Seasons are designed and iterated on based on delegate feedback. Retroactive Public Goods Funding rounds are designed and iterated on based on Citizen feedbackFeedback from high context stakeholders occurs informally, usually after designs are complete. Council Leads, top delegates, engaged Citizens, external teams, and/or RetroPGF recipients may be consulted on late stage drafts.Phase 1:Community consulted design process(Launching soon!)As we open source more of our design principles, process, and goals to the community we begin to build the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1.ethDenver 2024 presentationThe Collective DAO ArchivesIn Phase 1, community feedback will be incorporatedduringdesign process, not just after.Frequent polls on low context design parameters will be open to any community member‚Äôs input.Higher context feedback will be requested from a Collective Feedback Commission (CFC.) The Commission mostly formalizes what has to date been an informal process of collecting feedback from high context governance participants.About the Commission:The Commission will include 10 highly engaged Citizens and 15 high context delegates, selected based on qualifying criteria and opt-in requirements, to be published at a later date. The Foundation will request input from the Commission on early design drafts requiring a high degree of context. Commission feedback will be shared with the Foundation and other commission members, but may eventually be viewable by the entire community via a read-only public channel. We will experiment with the Commission for an initial trial period, evaluating its efficacy like any other experiment, using the process outlined above. More details will be posted to the forum shortly.Phase 2:Community directed design processIf continued, the Feedback Commission may evolve into a metaNERD contribution path, that would train and enable metaNERDs to design discrete components of the governance system. Imagine a bounty board of governance design components that can be completed by MetaNERDS.Phase 3:Collaborative design processFinally, if successful, the metaNERD contribution path may evolve into a Core Delegate program.Core Delegates are our vision for the group of high context governance participants that maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core Optimism governance system, similar to Core Devs, which maintain, contribute to, and evolve the core protocol.Meta MetaToday is an exciting day for the Collective as we take the first steps towards a more open, and ultimately more collaborative, metagovernance design process.As more of the Foundation‚Äôs governance design thinking is shared with the community, the shared context necessary to move into Phase 1 is built. To that end, today we‚Äôve open sourced several of our DAO design resources as additions to the Collective DAO Archives.The Collective DAO ArchivesDAO Design PrinciplesDAO Function GuidelinesGovernance System Design Goals (to be open sourced at a later date!)DAO Design Process (to be open sourced at ethCC!)As always, your feedback on all of the above is welcome below.","The Optimism Foundation is iteratively transitioning Optimism Collective governance to community control (open metagovernance).  This involves a hypothesis-driven, experimental approach:  hypotheses are formed based on community feedback and internal milestones, tested via experiments, analyzed, and iterated upon.  Currently in Phase 0 (community-informed design), the process will evolve through phases of increasing community consultation and direction (Phases 1-3), culminating in a ""Core Delegate"" program maintaining the system.  Resources like DAO design principles are being open-sourced to foster this transition.  A new Collective Feedback Commission will facilitate community input during the design process.

Governance  Design üìê,DappRadar DAO's participation within Optimism Collective,https://gov.optimism.io/t/dappradar-daos-participation-within-optimism-collective/7552,"IntroductionWarm greetings to the Optimism Collective community. Inspired byBase‚Äôs initial metagovernance manifesto, we at DappRadar DAO are thrilled to share our own: a strong statement that emphasizes our journey towards decentralization and a modus operandi regarding our future engagement with Optimism Collective.Why Optimism as Our First EngagementFor years, DappRadar has been a cornerstone in web3 adoption: getting users excited about promising projects, producing open data and educational resources across different ecosystems, and even maintaining critical node infrastructure.We are in the process of evolving from a centralized entity to a DAO, with a vision to build the World‚Äôs Dapp Store with RADAR and our community. This requires more active outreach with the ecosystem we seek to support.Inspired by both Optimism‚Äôs innovative approach to scaling permissionless, onchain activity (Superchain) and its dedication to funding public goods (Retro PGF), Optimism Collective provides an ideal forum for DappRadar DAO to implement and iterate our DAO-driven initiatives.Our Vision with OptimismOur vision in collaborating with Optimism is simple. DappRadar intends to earmark 3% of any Grant received (including our recent RetroPGF 3 award) to re-deploy into:Growth initiatives(utilizing our network and product to continue increasing education and engagement in Optimism Collective and Superchain) andGovernance initiatives(from participating in Proposals to delegating to aligned individuals and entities)By engaging with Optimism, we hope to also share learnings, as we progressively decentralize ourselves.ClosingWe warmly invite the Optimism community to read ourDappRadar DAO Metagovrernance Manifestoand join us in this exciting venture. We‚Äôll work with Optimism Collective and our community to shape how this participation will evolve.","DappRadar DAO, transitioning from a centralized entity to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), announces its metagovernance manifesto outlining its collaboration with the Optimism Collective.  Inspired by Optimism's scaling and public goods funding, DappRadar commits 3% of any received grants (including its RetroPGF 3 award) to growth and governance initiatives within the Optimism ecosystem.  This includes boosting education and engagement, and actively participating in proposals.  The collaboration aims to foster mutual learning as DappRadar continues its decentralization journey, building the ""World's Dapp Store.""

Feedback  üí¨,RetroPGF 3: Application Feedback,https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-feedback/6866,"This thread is to collect feedback on the RetroPGF 3 application processApplications for Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round 3 are live! You can applyhereand find guidelines on the application processhere. Applications will close on Oct 23rd.Iterating on Round 2 learningsBased on thelearnings and reflections from RetroPGF 2, we identified the challenge of gathering more high-quality data on projects to evaluate impact & profit. Feedback from Round 2 highlighted the need for greater alignment between the application form and the voting assessment process.SeeRetroPGF 3: Round Designfor an overview of the iterations that have been made based on Round 2 learnings.RetroPGF 3 Applications - gathering the correct data from ProjectsThe Optimism Collective is built on the axiom ofimpact=profit‚Äî the principle that positive impact on the Collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.To achieve this vision, the RetroPGF process should measure the impact projects provided to the Collective and the profit projects already generated from their impact. RetroPGF rewards are meant to fill the gap between a projects impact to the Collective and the profit they already received for that impact.The RetroPGF application form enables projects to self-report their impact & profit and provide references to relevant data sources. While the Collective has defined broad impact categories for RetroPGF, projects often have a more detailed understanding of how to measure the impact of their work, and it is important to empower them to surface their impact to badgeholders as they see fit.Impact statementThe RetroPGF application features a section called ‚Äúimpact statement‚Äù, in which projects can describe their contributions and the impact they provided to the Optimism Collective.See screenshot of the impact statementimage2000√ó3393 455 KBThe impact statement includes the following fields:Describe your contribution(s) to Optimism: A free-form text field in which projects can describe their contributionsContribution links: Projects can highlight external resources relating to their contributionsImpact category: Projects are asked to pick one or multiple of the Round 3 categories that best describe their impactImpact description: A free-form text field where projects can describe the impact their contributions provided to the Optimism CollectiveImpact metrics: Projects can highlight qualitative or quantitive metrics that highlight the impact of their contributionsAllowing projects to reference standardized external resources, such as Github Repos and onchain contracts, can power community-built data analytics tools to calculate projects‚Äô impact using a variety of different approaches and formulas.Impact metrics try to support the evaluation process by giving badgeholders measurable insights into the impact of a project, instead of solely relying on qualitative descriptions.Grants & FundingThe Grants and Funding section tries to collect information relevant to the profit side of the impact = profit equation. The main goal is to understand the funding projects have already received for their impact.See screenshot of the Grants & funding sectionimage2000√ó1039 127 KBProjects can add one or multiple grants and funding sources.For each grant/funding source, they can select from different categories (Governance fund, Partner fund, RetroPGF 2, RetroPGF 1, or ‚Äúother‚Äù) and provide an amount and a description of the grant/funding they received.While projects can volunteer information on investments they received, in this round the application form and guidelines do not require projects to report this information. The reasoning behind this is that venture investment is made in exchange for ownership in a project and, therefore, should not be considered as profit.The application form does not collect information relevant to means testing (see Vitalik‚ÄôsReview of Optimism retro funding round 1). Means testing tries to understand the means a project has at their disposal and how reliant projects are on RetroPGF rewards to continue their work.  By rewarding with the expectation of future work, means testing leans more towards proactive grant giving. As the main experiment here is to reward contributionsretroactively, RetroPGF 3 experiments with deprioritising collecting information relevant to means testing. If badgeholders finds this to be limiting in reviewing projects for RetroPGF 3, the Collective may iterate on this in future rounds.Call for FeedbackDoes the application form provide a smooth experience for applicants? Are there possible hurdles or unnecessary friction?Is the application form aligned with the review process of applications?Does the information provided by projects help badgeholders review their impact & profit?","Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) Round 3 applications are open until October 23rd.  This round addresses feedback from Round 2, focusing on improving data collection for impact and profit assessment.  The application emphasizes self-reported impact and profit, allowing projects to highlight contributions and funding received, while de-emphasizing means testing.  Feedback is sought on the application's user-friendliness, alignment with the review process, and the sufficiency of provided information for badgeholder review.  The goal is to ensure the ""impact = profit"" axiom is effectively measured, rewarding projects for their contributions to the Optimism Collective.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,Grant Misuse Reporting Process,https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-misuse-reporting-process/7346,"IndexOptimism Grant Misuse Reporting ProcessWhat is the Grant Misuse Reporting Process?DefinitionsScope of ProcessReport CriteriaGrant Misuse Report ProcessProcess OverviewConsiderations When Making a ReportProtection for Involved PartiesReport ValidationGrant Misuse Report TemplateOptimism Grant Misuse Reporting ProcessIn decentralised ecosystems it can be hard to stay on top of Grant usage and milestone execution. It is important that grant recipients are accountable to the Collective in order for Optimism to maintain a sustainable & healthy governance system.As the Optimism ecosystem expands there will be (and has been) a growing need to be able to find, track and call out these Grant Misuses. This process is intended to help the reporting community members (‚ÄùReporters‚Äù) to come forward with objective evidence based reports of Grant misuses in a safe and objective way.This is the first iteration of this process, and the process will evolve with each season (much like everything else) to support theOptimism Collective‚Äôsneeds.What is the Grant Misuse Reporting Process?Reporters reveal information about or bring attention to potential misuse of Collective Grants.TheseReports ARE anonymous.Reporters need to use accounts that are not associated with their real identity (Reporters are responsible for maintaining their own anonymity). Reports and evidence provided should be trustless. The Reporter should be inconsequential to the report as the evidence provided should be undeniable.In line with this,only onchain actions can be reported through this process(see Validation Requirements). If you are looking to report someone for non Grant related offchain behaviour, please see theRules of Engagement.Where a Report is determined to be valid and enforceable, the penalty will be for both the Project (team or dapp) and the founding members listed in the Grant to be recorded in the public ‚ÄúMisuse Reports Database‚Äù labeled under the severity of Misuse (see Definitions). This will allow Delegates, Badgeholders & Citizens to make informed decisions on future grants.DefinitionsFor the purpose of this process we use the following definitions:Team: The group, individual or project team that received the Grant.Commitment: The agreement or formal representations and public commitments the Team used to receive granted tokens or be allocated tokens (seeScope of Process).Misuse: In this process, the term ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù is defined in levels of severity, starting from least severe to the most. Misuse must be in relation to a Commitment. Only Grants made from March 2023 onward can be reported in this system.Failure to meet Critical Milestones: TheGrants Councilis responsible for checking critical Milestone completions. As such, failure to meet Milestones is NOT in scope of misuse. The sole exception to this are Season 4 Missions (which are out of scope for theGrants Council), which may be reported for ‚ÄúMissing Milestone(s)‚Äù.Breaking Commitments: Using tokens differently from Commitments is against the grant policies.Minor violations:Where meaningful, good faith steps have been taken to execute on the Commitments consistent with their spirit, but Commitments are still breached, the Grantee has committed a ‚Äúminor violation‚Äù ‚Äî i.e., a mild deviation on the specified execution plan.An example of this could look like changing execution plans (in line with the spirt of Commitments) but without approval from the Collective or the applicable Committee. A specific example could be changing the mechanism for sending tokens out in a user incentive campaign (like changing the number of users in a program, or the criteria for a competition, in a way that is still in line with the goal of the associated Commitments).Severe violations:The scope of severe Commitment violations should be limited to the following:Taking no action towards using tokens as defined in the associated Commitments (according to the timeline specified in the Commitment, or after 6 months).Using tokens for actions well outside of the scope of the associated Commitments. Actions that constitute ‚Äúwell outside the scope‚Äù are actions that were not defined in the Commitments, or are substantial and impactful deviations from the specified execution plan in the Commitments.A specific example could be changing the target, so if the grant was originally targeting end users but is now being used for a partnership, or was originally for development of a feature or integration but the grant is now being used for user incentives.Using bots or other manipulative means to fulfil Milestones, or otherwise inflate metrics or mislead the Collective in terms of the Teams progress towards execution.No Sale Violation: Violation of theno sale policy, from the date of implementation (March 2023) forward. Please see the ‚ÄúNo Sale Policy‚Äù in the Grant Policies for specifics.Scamming or Rugs: There are a few definitions of scamming:Note that scams or rugs MUST have received or applied for a Grant fromThe Optimism Collectiveto be covered under this process. See ‚ÄúReport Criteria‚Äù for more info.Scamming users, or using tokens to scam users. Scamming meaning taking user or Collective assets without providing advertised services, or taking more assets than agreed on (also called ‚Äúdraining‚Äù a wallet).Applying for a Grant/Mission with a fake project or team, impersonating a team and other activity taken to intentionally mislead the Collective or community (e.g: serial scammers).Scope of ProcessThis Reporting Process only covers grants made, and corresponding tokens allocated, by the Optimism Token House. For example, RetroPGF recipients are currently outside the scope of this process (in their capacity as such). The scope may expand to include other programs in the future.Report CriteriaThe following criteria set aims to ensure reports are relevant to the ecosystem, while balancing potential process abuse or spam.The project, individual, or accused action MUST have taken place on the Optimism network AND with tokens granted by the Optimism Token House.While scams and other abuses, wherever they may take place, are regrettable, this Reporting Process is not designed to capture everything all at once.The Grant Misuse amount in question MUST be equal to or more than 50k OP or $50k USD if not denominated in OP.This minimum is for the amount that has been misused, not the total grant amount. Handling Reports is a time consuming process and should be taken seriously, given it may involve accusations that go to the reputation and credibility of a grant recipient.The activity MUST have taken place onchain, AND be provable onchain.Reports need to meet a high level of objective proof. Sadly, off chain activities are incredibly difficult to prove in a trustless manner, and introduce significant amounts of subjectivity. Note that additional offchain evidence (such as messages) can be used tosupplement a claim, but the main evidence for a claim MUST be onchain.Information provided MUST be publicly verifiable.If you do submit screenshots of messages, one should be able to verify it. For example, a screen shot of a Discord server messages are verifiable, DM messages are not.The action MUST have taken place in the last 12 months.Reports should be lively. Reports on Grant Misuse activities that took place far in the past can create uncertainty and duplication, while bogging down the Report evaluation system.The action MUST not already have an active or already reviewed Report.If there is an existing Report please add your evidence to that report. New reports on existing topics will get rejected.If the matter being Reported has already been reported and resolved (regardless of the outcome), the matter will be considered ‚Äúclosed‚Äù for the purposes of this process, and cannot be reopened by a new Report.Grant Misuse Report ProcessNote:Keep in mind that this Reporting process does not protect you against any legal commitments (such as confidentiality) or obligations (not to defame) that you may have in the context of the information you choose to submit in your Reports.Process OverviewThe Report is posted in the Governance Form under ‚ÄúGrant Misuse Reports‚Äù.  The Report will be unlisted (private) for a maximum of 3 days while it is checked.During this Hold Period (the first 3 days after the report is submitted) the report is checked and the accused is attempted to be notified.Report Checking: The report MUST conform to the template provided in this document. Reports that do not follow the template will be rejected irrespective of report validity. Reports can be resubmitted to conform with the template.Accused notification: During the Hold Period the accused will be sent the report and given opportunity to respond on the forum. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord, Discourse, etc, whatever communication line was provided in the original Grant) by an official Optimism account.Report posted publicly.After the Hold Period the report is filed publicly in the governance forum under the ‚ÄúGrant Misuse Reports‚Äù section.The Report is validated publicly over a maximum of 6 weeks (see Report Validation for details).During the Validation phase the Reporter may be asked to provide further detail or clarify points. This MUST all happen publicly. Attempts to DM the Reporter will be considered as acting with hostility. In turn, the Reporter may NOT DM the accused, as this will also be seen as acting with hostility.Hostility towards or attacks against a good faith Reporter will be considered a Severe Violation of theRules of Engagementand may result in the infringer‚Äôs removal from Optimism platforms. See theRules of Engagementfor more info.Outcome of a report.If the report is validated, the Team (group, individual or project team that received the grant) are added to the ‚ÄúMisuse Reports Database‚Äù.If the report fails validation the report is noted as invalid, but no further action is taken against the team or Reporter and nothing is added to the database.Considerations When Making a ReportThe process for submitting a Report is relatively straightforward.Create a doc with the template provided later in this document. Ensure every claim has a transaction or supplementary evidence, and that your report follows the Report Criteria, and meets the specified Misuse Definition. Make sure your report is clear and as simple to follow as possible.All reports posted in the reporting section will be hidden by default. You are responsible for maintaining your own anonymity, so ensure you are on the correct account BEFORE posting.If your post does not comply with the guidelines or template it will be removed during the Hold Period, and you will be notified. You are free to update the report in line with the feedback you receive and resubmit.Report MUST be factual. Do not editorialize with opinions, subjective statements, or derogatory adjectives.Reports that contain inflammatory language or unsubstantiated claims do not meet the guidelines and will be removed. Accusations and discussions around the report should ONLY happen on the post on the governance forum. Discussions in other platforms (such as Discord) can be seen as harassment or intimidation and may constitute a violation of theRules of Engagement.Protection for Involved PartiesReportersReporters should be available to answer questions during the verification phase. Reporters are only expected to respond to public requests for information, and are encouraged to report harassment (both public and private) immediately.Any harassment of a good faith reporter will be treated as a Severe Violation of theRules of Engagementand may result in the harassers‚Äô removal from all Optimism platforms.Should the accused reach out to the Reporter directly, the accused will immediately be in violation of theRules of Engagement(see Intimidation) and will result in their suspension from all Optimism platforms. This will happen regardless of if the accused has responded to the report yet.AccusedThe accused party or project will be notified of the Report before it goes public. The accused will have the Hold Period to pull together a response, or counter evidence. This window of time closes irrespective of if the accused reads the communication. Accused will be notified via a reasonable medium (i.e email, Discord, Discourse, etc) by an official Optimism account.Note that the accused may not attack or even address the reporter, and are ONLY allowed to respond to the evidence provided. Accused may ONLY refer the the reporter as ‚Äúthe Reporter‚Äù.The accused will be notified once the Hold Period is completed, so that they may have the opportunity to be the first response to the Report.Note that the response can only respond to the evidence or narrative provided in the Report. If a response attacks or addresses the reporter (see reporter protections) the response will be removed, and the accused may be suspended from all Optimism platforms.NumbaNERDsAny attempts to DM the NumbaNERDs from either the Reporter or Accused (or associated team) will be considered harassment. All communication MUST happen through the public post and address evidence directly.Report ValidationReports are validated by the NumbaNERDs (a collective of contributors focused on analytics).To disprove or invalidate provided transaction evidence one must prove:The claim misrepresents what happens in the transaction or the transaction had been approved by governance. I.e: if funds are withdrawn from an address but this was a governance approved withdrawal and not a rug.That the provided transaction(s) are not related to the claim or are described in a way that mislead readers as to the nature of the transaction. I.e: the transaction provided is an NFT transfer not a funds transfer.The amount in question is found to be below the required minimum. I.e: The report misrepresented the total amount in question.The Report does not meet any of the standards laid out in the Report Criteria.Anyone can post evidence to prove or disprove elements of a report, however only NumbaNERDs can ultimately Validate or Invalidate a claim. Supporting evidence can be disproven, however this will not get a report invalidated.Validation requirementsA GovNERD will ensure the report follows the template, does not contain inflammatory language, and is not a duplicate report.If the Report is invalid, the reporter will be notified.If the Report is valid, an Optimism admin will notify the accused from an official account.Is the claim labeled correctly? i.e if it is ‚ÄúScams & Rugs‚Äù does it fit the definition?At least 3 NumbaNERDs will independently verify the onchain transactions & evidence to ensure it supports the claims being made.Is the amount in question reaching the required minimums? (see report Criteria)Does the evidence support the claim? Is there enough onchain data to back up the claim?If the claim is Valid the govNERDs will play the administrative role of adding the Report to the Database. If the claim is invalid, no action is taken.Verification of a report cannot take longer than 6 weeks in order to limit the process to a reasonable amount of time. If at the end of the 6 weeks a report is not Validated OR Invalidated, it is archived as ‚ÄúUndecided‚Äù and will not be added to the database.Whether a report is Valid, Invalid or Undecided, a new report CANNOT be made for the same misuse. If new evidence is discovered, it can be submitted to the existing report. This will reopen (or extend) the review period by 3 weeks in which the new evidence can be reviewed. If the report is found Invalid or Undecided after this 3 week period the matter is considered settled and cannot be reopened.Reports in the database will not be removed as there is no direct consequence of being listed in the database (it does not result in an automatic future grant freeze, for example). Rather this database alerts governance participants to consider the reports when making future grant decisions.Grant Misuse Report TemplateGrant Misuse Report TemplateBefore filling out a Report please make sure you have read and understand the ‚ÄúReport Criteria‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúProtections for Involved Parties‚Äù and ‚ÄúDefinitions‚Äù.

This should be a concise description of WHAT the involved parties are accused of as well as the main evidence of the claim. Try keeping this under 1000 words.I.e:The project ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù received a Grant from the Token House (TX on the 20 OCT 2023) with the following objectives: ‚ÄúIncrease usage on ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù through a user generated content competition‚Äù.However, ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù misused their grant by violating the ‚ÄúNo Sale rule‚Äù.After ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù received their tokens they transfered them to Coinbase over 3 transactions (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023). Each time the address received USDC (TX 22 OCT 2023, TX 25 OCT 2023, TX 29 OCT 2023).When community members asked about these transactions, the team attacked them personally (see supplementary evidence 5).Summaries should be:Clear, easy to follow and contain all the essential information, such as:What the accused had agreed to do in their Commitment.What the specific misuse was.The main evidence of the misuse claim (with transactions, times & dates provided in UTC). Please write out months as 3 letters: DD MMM YYYY. Do NOT use DD.MM.YY or MM.DD.YY formats to avoid confusion.Not contain any personal attacks against the accused, nor make any unsubstantiated claims about the projects or its team.Involved Parties:The offending address(es).Link between project and address(es) should ALWAYS start with the address provided in the Commitment or other provided addresses in the Commitment.Links between individuals and addresses MUST be undeniable (i.e an ENS name as their handle, using the address to apply for Grants in an ecosystem, etc).If you do not have ONLY onchain evidence of a link between an individual and the address(es) then refrain from making this link. Please exercise extreme caution when linking identities to address, as you are still bound by the DOXXing definitions and consequences in theRules of Engagement. Reports that DOX anyone will be censored (to remove identifying information). If unsure if the information is DOXXing, use the handles/identities used in the gov forum, or simply refer to addresses.I.e:0x123‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Address provided by ‚ÄúProj3ct‚Äù in their Grant application.0x321‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Address that received the USDC. Address is suspected to be@fred42as the ENS name is fred42.eth, which is also associated with a twitter account by the same name. This is also their handle in the Optimism Governance forum used to post their Commitment.Timeline of events:What happened? This should be the bulk of your report. This should have a step by step timeline of what happened, and link directly to transactions. Try keeping each line item down to a single action. Multiple actions in a step may make the report difficult to follow.

Anonymous reports, focusing solely on on-chain actions involving at least $50,000 in misused Optimism (OP) tokens or USD, are submitted via a governance form.  Reports undergo a three-day review period, followed by a six-week public validation phase by NumbaNERDs.  Misuse is defined by severity, ranging from minor commitment breaches to severe violations like scamming.  The process prioritizes objective, verifiable evidence and protects reporters from harassment.  Validated reports are added to a public database, informing future grant decisions.  Invalid reports are archived, and the process aims to be timely and efficient.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,Code of Conduct Council accountability reports S6,https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-accountability-reports-s6/8990,"Hello Optimism collective! The Code of Conduct Council for this season 6 is happy to present its mid-season report, where we made self evaluation of our role, and proposed insights from identified conflicting patterns. You can check our charterhere._1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?Reporter Experience KPIs:We have maintained a reasonable response time for most reports. Initial responses are typically provided within 48 hours. However, in some complex cases, particularly those requiring deeper investigation or coordination with other teams, response times have extended slightly, up to 5 days. Also the council considers that that the scope needs to be better communicated, as some reports have been outside of our competence and capacity.Number of reports that de-escalate without enforcement actions: So far, we have received 4 reports and managed to defuse most conflicts (around 90%) without the need for formal enforcement action. In cases where enforcement is required, we strictly adhere to the rules of engagement and provide transparency in all our decisions. You can review our summary of cases inthis postin the forum.No community members have disengaged from the community because of unmanaged conflicts in season 6, reinforcing our role in the Token House as a sensory node that identifies patterns, looks out for solutions, and provides feedback to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.Accountability and transparency around the due processing of cases: Regular updates on case handling have been shared on the forum. All cases are documented with detailed reports on the actions taken, maintaining transparency and accountability.Number of updates to charters and operating procedures: there was one significant update to our charter, where we made more precise the enforcement of sanctions. Ongoing discussions highlight the need to propose some changes, planning for the coming growth phase of the superchain and the evolving governance framework of Optimism.Availability and ease of access to the council: We have provided availability for the community to raise concerns to the council and its members. Participation in office hours was lower than expected, but we continue to promote these sessions to increase visibility and still provide accessibility. We also want to Invite other communities to our office hours, so that we can cross pollinate and promote good practices within the superchain.Performance KPIs:Number of community members leaving due to unmanaged conflict:We have not observed any significant resignations or departures due to unresolved conflicts. We aim to maintain this standard by continuing proactive engagement.Token votes related to conflict management actions:So far, no council members have been dismissed or challenged through the Representative Removal proposal mechanism, reflecting strong trust in the CoCC‚Äôs operations and decisions.Separation of conflict visibility from the collective:We have maintained a high level of confidentiality, ensuring that conflicts are handled privately until resolution, with public announcements made only when necessary, in accordance with the Charter guidelines. In that sense, we are actively contributing to the perceived well being of the collective.2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?The CoCC has successfully upheld its mandate in managing conflicts while maintaining a focus on decentralization and community-driven governance. Our proactive efforts, such as offering early guidance and mediation before conflicts escalate, have been highly effective. Additionally, our monthly office hours have allowed us to engage directly with the community, ensuring we remained accessible. While office hours can foster greater visibility of the council and its work, in practice, reports do not usually occur in public and synchronous spaces.The CoCC has conveyed a sense of rigor and fairness in the community that has influenced the perceived well-being of this season 6. Not having huge emergencies can be considered a good sign, and we are ready and available for any cases that arise, big and small.We are individually studying every case that is reported, acting as sensory nodes for the community and the foundation, and besides promoting short term solutions, we are identifying valuable feedback and improvement opportunities to consolidate the recommendations listed as final points of this post.We consider that the impact of our work should not be isolated from the work of other councils and groups that are key for the sustainability of the organization, so we highlight our efforts towards interconnection, composability, and complementarity between the CoCC and all governance structures. Our impact is to be a support wheel so that all other stakeholders can coordinate and overcome difficulties.3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP‚Äôs)?We propose adding stronger guidelines for communication in public forums and Discord channels to prevent escalations arising from abusive language or harassment.The current scope of the CoCC is clear, but there is a need to further focus on filling governance gaps as the superchain grows. We need to think in emergent areas of conflict related to the expanding complexity of the superchain, to promote clear boundaries for what is shared and what is not shared between chains, and consolidate good practices.There should be more connection between the CoCC and the provision of mediation by third parties. Currently they are expected to be of easy access to the community with their own forms and presence, but we consider that managing two forms separately is harder than managing one, in which cases are then delegated to the right team. We think having just one form could avoid double accountability, asymmetry of information, and arbitrary callings to the mediation third party.4. Suggested Changes to the Charter:Create strategies to increase and measure Interconnection between the CoCC and other teams. Eg: Visibility of the council‚Äôs availability during community spaces, collaborations with other councils and governance teams, and activity of the council lead to feedback activities.Furthermore, clearer guidelines regarding sanctions‚Äîspecifically the process and criteria for issuing warnings, temporary suspensions, and other enforcement actions‚Äîshould be further detailed in the CharterCoCC was not included in retroactive funding for Season 6, we believe that our ongoing contributions to the governance framework should be considered for inclusion in retroactive funding for Season 7.We suggest to position the COCC as the main place for complaints in the collective, with the role of connecting requests to the pertinent parties, and ensuring that all cases have due diligence and are properly processed and translated into improvements.5. Self evaluation:The first area where we can improve is making our processes more visible to the community, to more clearly demonstrate the impact of our work and strengthen trust in the council.Once elected, the council should meet twice a week for the first few months to allow for members to get even information and context for prevention and case intake. This role requires onboarding for new representatives so that handoff of information between seasons happens gracefully.We can strengthen collaboration between the CoCC and other governance bodies, because even though we have good communication paths with them, enhancing the composability aspect can create higher value than the sum of its parts.Conflict Resolution Best Practices: Continue refining our preventive approach by introducing more proactive measures, such as hosting workshops or educational sessions for the community on conflict resolution and governance. This includes consolidating evergreen content for the Optimism collective, and promoting standards for the superchain.Perception of value and self-inflicted pressure: Since the impact of our work is harder to measure than other contributions, there has been some self-inflicted pressure on the members of the CoCC to validate our work. We think that raising awareness about the value being brought to the collective by the CoCC can reduce the stress on council members on meeting expectations.Even when we would like to include enthusiasts in the community that want to support us with what we do, we decided to not mix our nature of an elected body that manages confidentiality with opening new contribution paths. We are open to collaborate with all existing contribution paths, but not stewarding any one.6. Recommendations:Including more proactive guidance on Web3 security and best practices. This can help prevent certain types of conflicts related to vulnerabilities or misunderstandings around blockchain security.Follow up on the announcement and execution of the education sessions by the Resolv3 team for season 6.There is a recurring pattern of conflicts related to grant allocation and perceptions of centralization or favoritism. We recommend increasing transparency in the grant process and continuously emphasizing decentralized governance.We have observed a rising trend of projects manipulating transaction volumes to create misleading on-chain activity. This could damage Optimism‚Äôs reputation. We suggest stricter guidelines regarding the reporting and evaluation of on-chain data.We have received concerns regarding the verification and legitimacy process for profiles and projects in funding rounds. We received a complaint about 5 artists Whose NFTs were plagiarized by false profiles who eventually got benefit in their place.On Information asymmetry. We have noticed that there is a delta between the foundation plans and contributors‚Äô awareness. We think that even when it is intended to not overwhelm the community with too much complexity, it would be recommended to develop complexity tolerance, looking for preparation on progressive decentralization.On Composability of councils and governance efforts. Thanks to the seasonal cadence of Optimism, there is a fast rotation of elected representatives, and we consider that designing an onboarding path for these roles can help handing off information and carrying good practices between seasons. Creating a rich culture is what will keep the community together, even when rotating and decentralizing.On Superchain boundaries and interop in governance: As Optimism expands,the CoCC should collaborate to establish governance frameworks that are interoperable, respecting local contexts while adhering to core principles. Ensuring that we continue to provide a robust framework for conflict management within the ever-evolving Optimism ecosystem.On Communication styles: Early indications show that most cases reflect common patterns related to communication problems. We have noticed that contributors in different platforms sometimes express themselves in terms of Interpretation, Judgement, Strategy and demands. We consider that frameworks like Nonviolent communication (NVC) can be shared and practiced to help expressing in terms of observations, feelings, needs and requests, making it easier, both to understand, express, and negotiate effectively in a life enriching dialogue.Thank you for reading our mid-season report. We look forward to the rest of season 6 and the transition to season 7Remember that you can request support from the Code of Conduct Council at any time throughthis form, or contacting directly a member of the team.","The Optimism Collective's Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) presents its Season 6 mid-season report.  Responding to 4 reports, the CoCC de-escalated 90% of conflicts without enforcement, maintaining community engagement.  Transparency and accountability were upheld via forum updates and detailed case documentation.  While response times occasionally exceeded 48 hours, the CoCC successfully prevented community disengagement due to conflict.  Proposed improvements include clearer communication guidelines, refined sanction procedures, enhanced inter-council collaboration, and improved community visibility of CoCC processes.  Further recommendations focus on proactive conflict prevention through education, addressing grant allocation concerns, combating on-chain data manipulation, and strengthening profile verification.  The CoCC aims to become the central point for complaints, ensuring due diligence and fostering a more robust, interoperable governance framework for the expanding Optimism ecosystem.

The proposal wasapproved back in voting cycle 2.Proposed Fund Allocation:35% Marketing (105,000 OP):For targeted marketing campaigns, community events, and incentives for influencers to promote Wardenswap on Optimism.20% Trader Incentives (60,000 OP):For early adopters and active users to boost trading activity on Optimism.10% Referral Program (30,000 OP):For a program benefiting users who promote the use of WardenSwap on Optimism .25% Builder (75,000 OP):For grants or hackathons to aid developers integrating WardenSwap in the Optimism ecosystem.10% Development & Maintenance (30,000 OP):To cover associated costs of their Optimism related project.Controversies and Concerns:Marketing Initiatives:Post-approval, Warden Swap has demonstrated minimal marketing activity related to Optimism throughtout the 1 year period after they received the fund, notable only through two tweets:Synthetix integration on Optimism:LinkCommunity Distribution campaign:LinkTrader Distribution:Only 10,000 OP was distributed for their userswho use their platform from August 1, 2022, to February 16, 2023, despite the initial proposal of full distribution within a year.Transactions from this distribution can be found here:OP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet EtherscanOP Mainnet Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | OP Mainnet Etherscan.Theannouncementindicated a plan to extend the distribution timeline to four years, diverging from the initial one-year proposal made to the OP collective.Builder & Referral Programs:There have been no significant activities or developments in these areas, raising questions about the allocated funds for builders and referral incentives.Recent Developments:After a period of inactivity since Feb 2023, WardenSwap tweeted on May 2, 2024, aboutreorganizing with a new team and upcoming plans. On May 10, 2024, they proposed asnapshot voteto distribute OP tokens to traders and token holders, but without clear criteria. The team mentioned if approved there will be a ‚Äúfair criteria for everyone, and the terms of the OP distribution will be announced in the next announcement.‚ÄùControversially, approximately 17 new wallet holders, who began accumulating WAD tokens (the governance token of WardenSwap) since February 2024 just prior to the comeback announcement, participated in the vote. This situation washighlightedby a vigilant community member who noted the unusual timing and activity, raising concerns within the community regarding the legitimacy of the voting process and potential insider influence, as these new participants appear to disproportionately affect the outcome of governance decisions.cc.@Gonna.eth@op_julian","Warden Swap, approved for a 300,000 OP governance fund in June 2022, has faced significant criticism for its minimal marketing and inadequate distribution of promised trader incentives.  Only a fraction of the allocated funds were dispersed, with a proposed four-year rollout contradicting the initial one-year plan.  Builder and referral programs remain largely inactive.  A recent, controversial snapshot vote, influenced by newly-created WAD token holders, further fuels concerns about transparency and potential manipulation within the project.  The community remains highly skeptical of Warden Swap's activities and the use of its allocated funds.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,How to Contribute: OP Rewards Analytics,https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-contribute-op-rewards-analytics/5975,"BackgroundTo date, the Governance Fund has approved over 60M OP in total to incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. It is important for delegates and the broader collective to have access to transparent information that allows them to make data-driven decisions and understand how projects are allocating their OP rewards and evaluate their performance.The data team at OP Labs previously shared rewards analysis reports as part of the collective learning. For our March update, we set up an open-sourcerepository on GitHubwhere we‚Äôre building the code used to track token distributions, attribute project usage (Dune queries), and measure liquidity flows.When we announced that this repo was open for anyone to help build, the first question was‚ÄúWhere should people contribute?‚ÄùThis post aims to help potential contributors get started.You can find past reports:May 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics UpdateApr 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics UpdateMar 2023 - Governance Call OP Rewards Analytics UpdateWe want to work with the community to refine our measurements and better understand the effective of token incentives.

Further details can be found in thesespells.For DeFi-related projects, tracking net TVL flows via APIs fromDeFiLlamaandThe Graph, as well as volumes throughdex.tradeson Dune.Metrics MethodologyIn the latest iteration, we evaluate the performance of an incentive program based on its impact on general usage (i.e., incremental transactions, addresses, and gas fees) and the goals it aims to achieve (e.g., liquidity mining, trading volume).The incremental impact is measured against the average performance of an app 30 days before an incentive program launch. Once the incentive program ends, we also assess its impact on usage and other goals in the 30 days following the program‚Äôs conclusion.To make it comparable, we then standardize the metrics above with running amount of OP distributed to measure impact per OP.This methodology gives us a set of common metrics to evaluate programs by, but it is far from perfect (See the Contribute section for how to help make it better). There can be factors that muddy what usage can be attributed to a program, such as overlapping incentive programs, and external forces that significantly alter usage patterns. These may also not even be the right measures to count, each app likely has detailed metrics that are more relevant for future growth. We will continue working with our community to refine our measurements to better understand the effectiveness of token incentives.","Optimism's Governance Fund has allocated over 60M OP to incentivize ecosystem growth.  To improve transparency and data-driven decision-making, OP Labs has open-sourced its rewards analytics tracking on GitHub.  This initiative encourages community contributions to refine metrics, improve data visualization (currently via Dune dashboards and CSV files), and develop better methodologies for evaluating program effectiveness.  Contributions range from program analysis and dashboard creation to improving the data pipeline and proposing new metrics.  The current methodology assesses program impact based on usage changes (transactions, addresses, gas fees) before and after program launch, standardized per OP distributed.  The community is invited to participate in improving these analyses and informing future governance grant allocations.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,Guidance on Severe Violations of the Rules of Engagement,https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-severe-violations-of-the-rules-of-engagement/5729,"0. SCOPEWhen talking about harassment it is important to understand who and what can be harassed. We believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. This means treating people with kindness regardless of what you think they have done (i.e., even if you think they are scamming others).No one deserves to be harassed.Harassment is about howyoutreatthemand has nothing to do with what they are doing.0.1 HARASSMENT VS. CRITICISMBefore we get into they types of harassment, let‚Äôs make the distinction between making a valid critique of an individual or project‚Äôs actions and harassment.EXAMPLESLaying out the facts with clear supporting evidence in an appropriate place, without including your personal opinion with the evidence.e.g.: Project XYZ transferred their funds on xx day, as you can see in this transaction 0x‚Ä¶. This action clearly violated the no sale rule outlined in the Operating Manual. I have started a thread in the Monitoring governance form, if anyone else has evidence please add it.Posting evidence on Twitter/Discord does not help in reporting destructive behavior. Arguing with people is not the correct way to report misconduct.This form of engagement often ends up as harassment. Please use the correct method for reporting, as laid out in the Rules of Engagement.In a highly public forum (like Discord) making  unsubstantiated claims using inflammatory, hostile, rude or otherwise emotional language, encouraging or outright calling others to take action individually rather than following the appropriate process.e.g.: Project XYZ is a scam and will steal all your money! The founders are all scammers and should never be allowed to make another project! Everyone should report them!1. CYBER BULLYINGThere are multiple ways you can cyber bully individuals and projects. They are all harmful and violate theRules of Engagement.1.1 PUBLIC HARASSMENTPublic harassment is attempting to make an individual or project look bad in a public space, such as Twitter or Discord. This kind of harassment often uses inflammatory and emotional language and may escalate to encouraging others to harass the individual as well (see 1.3).It may take the form of multiple Tweet threads or messages directly attacking the individual or project.EXAMPLESINDIVIDUALüö´ This person is unqualified and a bad delegate, and if you delegate to them then you are what is wrong with the world.PROJECTüö´ This project is a scam and will rug you! The founders are terrible and should not be allowed back! @founderTo report public harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as screenshots of multiple instances of this type of behavior in a public platform.1.2 PRIVATE HARASSMENTPrivate harassment looks like intimidation. This could take the form of directly messaging an individual and threatening to report them, doxx or otherwise cause them distress. Private harassment is a repeated behavior (one message warning that you will be reported does not qualify).Private harassment is often done as a means to an end, for example threatening to release information if an individual does not perform a certain action (such as voting a specific way or sending funds). Private harassment does not need to have ulterior motives to qualify. Private harassment does require multiple offenses to qualify.To report private harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as screenshots of multiple direct messages.1.3 ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO HARASSEncouraging others to attack, harass or otherwise disrupt an individual or project also constitutes harassment.This may look like encouraging others to report a project or person on a platform (like Twitter, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, etc.). This is especially harmful during investigations as it may obscure evidence or escalate to doxxing.To report encouragement of harassment, you would have to provide evidence such as multiple screenshots of posts (on any platform) that encourage, suggest or otherwise imply that others should join in the harassment.2. DOXXINGPrivacy is a fundamental human right that the Collective takes seriously. Doxxing is searching for and posting or otherwise making publicly available any private or personally identifying information, in a public forum, where the information was not already available.The information does not have to be correct for it to constitute doxxing.2.1 PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATIONDoxxing includes sharing information that identifies a person, such as their real name, place of work, links to other profiles of theirs that have additional personal information (such as a LinkedIn profile), and the like.EXAMPLESally has her name as her handle in Discord (@Sally45), as well as having her PFP set to a photo of her. She is not anonymous, but she can still be doxxed.Sally and Fred get into an argument about a proposal that Sally posted. Fred is very upset, and finds Sally‚Äôs LinkedIn profile and obtains her last name. He then posts her full name in Discord, telling others she is a scammer.This is considered doxxing as Fred researched Sally with the intent of exposing her. He researched additional personal identifying information and then cross posted this information that was not available on Discord.Fred has doxxed Sally, and as such violated theRules of Engagement.To report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a screenshot of the offender posting personally identifying information in a public forum.2.1.1 LINKING INFORMATIONDoxxing includes searching for information about an individual that links their anon profile to their identity.This can look like posting a photo of an anon person (say, from a conference) and tagging their anon handle, thus linking their face to their handle. ALWAYS ask permission before posting photos that have other people in them.To report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a screenshot of the offender posting a photo or personally identifying information in a public forum.2.2 PHYSICAL LOCATIONDoxxing also includes publicly disclosing someone‚Äôs physical location. This can look like posting hotel rooms, home addresses, or place of work address (office address).To qualify as a physical location doxxing for purposes of violating theRules of Engagement, the location information needs to be specific enough for someone to reasonably find the person based off this information. Note that even if disclosing physical location does not amount to aRules of Engagement violation, it is still strongly discouraged.EXAMPLESSally lives in America.This is not doxxing as this information is too broad to find Sally. However, this kind of sharing is still strongly discouraged.Sally is attending ETHConference.This is not specific enough to cause Sally physical danger, or to be used to find her. However, this is strongly discouraged and may result in a warning. If the offending post includes a call to action (such as ‚Äúif you see her ask her why she scammed people!!‚Äù) or is otherwise tied to harassment, then it would constitute a violation under harassment.Sally is staying in Average Hotel!This puts Sally in danger, and is considered a physical location doxx.Sally lives on 123 Imagine Road, City.This puts Sally in danger, and is considered a physical location doxx.To report this type of doxxing, you would have to provide evidence such as a screenshot of the offender posting your physical location in a public forum.Update ProcessThe Rules of Engagement, and any other associated documents, must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following extraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a change log will be published for delegates.","This document defines harassment, differentiating it from constructive criticism.  Harassment includes cyberbullying (public and private), encouraging others to harass, and doxxing.  Public harassment involves spreading false or inflammatory information in public forums. Private harassment entails repeated intimidation or threats. Doxxing is the public release of private identifying information, including location or links connecting anonymous profiles to real identities.  All forms require evidence (screenshots) for reporting and violate the Rules of Engagement, which are updated only during Reflection Periods or extraordinary circumstances.

DAOs and governance in general is a tricky beast, and I am very impressed with how the system works thus far. Unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt seem like this system of grants will suit a project like Tidus Wallet (the project I am a part of), and many projects for that matter going into the future.We all know what grants are supposed to be for, and the main three I am aware of under Optimism besides specific mission applications are: Builder‚Äôs Grant, Growth Experiments, and retroPGF.I‚Äôm just extremely perplexed by the whole process. We were under the impression that a builder‚Äôs grant is a grant to ‚Äòbuild‚Äô.We(Tidus) say we‚Äôll build XYZ(for Optimism), Grant is paid out once we do X then Y, then Z. The grant is used to build and only rewarded when something is built. Optimism grants are time-locked for an entire year. (perhaps I‚Äôm missing some details)BUT, if OP goes to .75 cents in a year we just built something for a year and our grant is now 1/4 of the size when we started, but my build obligation is the same. I don‚Äôt think anyone would mind if it was in small increments, but we are offering a larger upgrade.Okay. Well maybe apply for a different type of grant right? Well, we can‚Äôt apply for a ‚Äògrowth experiment‚Äô grant because you can‚Äôt apply grant money to operations, only distribution to users. (found this out on first application attempt)Finally there is retroPGF, where you build something, or support something on OP, but hope to get granted some money as retro, not going to go into who deserves what etc‚Ä¶ and all the politics of that, but that‚Äôs probably the only grant a project like ours could reasonably hope for.Really appreciate Optimism‚Äôs commitment to governance, and the crypto space in general, but I hope you guys can see how bad a decision this would be for a project like us on the other end of this process. I regret to have had to pull our grant application(really wanted to work on the OP stack). We can‚Äôt risk getting nothing a year after building. We‚Äôre just a bootstrapped wallet that has fought to build through the last cycle and we will have to look elsewhere for integration. Thanks again for all your help.-Bob",Summary not available

Balancer & Bee‚Ä¶Update - Jan/23[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Balancer & BeethovenXGovernance Fund: Phase 1Hi@lavandeThanks for reaching out! I am responding to you as I do the financial reporting for Beethoven X. 
Our grant proposal allows us only to spend the grant money if we can match it with protocol fees. 
We wanted to give back to the Optimism ecosystem so we decided to see if we could take things a step further. We have achieved this by using our protocol fees to buy $OP tokens on the open market. This enabled us to do the matching on a token level. 
As of today, we have spent a net of 71k‚Ä¶After comprehensive evaluation, discussion, and research regarding the original grant from Seasons 2 and 3, the Beethoven X DAO believes it has optimized a viable and sustainable OP grant strategy that will help the Optimism Ecosystem scale sustainably. This incentive strategy is a long-term grant solution focused on incentive longevity that nourishes growth for the entire Optimism ecosystem without burning OP tokens for short-term returns.Rather than solely emitting OP tokens to Liquidity Pools, the Beethoven X DAO has taken steps towards developing a more symbiotic relationship with the OP ecosystem. For the initial grant application, the DAO proposed that OP tokens from the grant would only distribute to Liquidity Providers if matched with an equal share of protocol fees.To further solidify a symbiotic relationship with the Optimism ecosystem, the DAO optimized the grant to bolster OP sustainability further. All protocol fees previously paired with OP were instead utilized to buy an equal amount of $OP tokens from the open market to pair with the grant as issued. This strategy means that all grant spending on the protocol is matched 1:1 on an OP token level. To our knowledge, the Beethoven X DAO is the only protocol buying an equal share of OP matched with the grant instead of simply spending it.As of today, Beethoven X has spent a net of 97k $OP tokens, with 113k $OP bought back from the open market with protocol fees. This structure helped amass $60 million in TVL in April 2023, with TVL currently sitting around the $25m mark. The DAO is proud of how mutually beneficial and efficient this strategy has been in terms of $OP spent and will continue to move forward with new implementations and partners.Some partner protocols asked the Beethoven X DAO to distribute their $OP grant on their behalf; these are all included in the table‚Äôs inflow and outflow.Currently, the combined Balancer/BeethovenX deployment holds the highest amount of rETH liquidity on Optimism, and the DAOs partnership with the Oath Foundation has showcased the profound potential of Boosted Pools and Yield Bearing assets for growing interconnected ecosystem liquidity. Beethoven X is also the sole protocol that unlocks the benefits of the 8020 initiative and its optimized governance tokenomics for protocols on Optimism. Paraswap and Ethos Reserve are two protocols that have harnessed this technology so far, with over $2.3 million in TVL collectively.With veBALs cross-chain boost now live on Optimism, Aura Finance looks to further fuel liquidity growth withincentive market efficiencies. The DAO is eager to implement and combine the sustainable OP grant strategy with Aura to scale core pool dynamics, ve80/20, and help elevate the BeethovenX-Balancer joint deployment and, by extension, Optimism, to the next level.If you would like to verify any numbers discussed above, the Beethoven X DAO Treasury multisig is found here:OP Mainnet ExplorerGnosisSafeProxy | Address 0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60 | OP...The Contract Address 0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60 page allows users to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract address.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,Analysis Report: Via Protocol Phase 1 Grant Proposal,https://gov.optimism.io/t/analysis-report-via-protocol-phase-1-grant-proposal/6844,"IntroductionIn response to the task provided, this report offers a comprehensive analysis of Via Protocol‚Äôs Phase 1 grant proposal. The recent transition in leadership, with the CEO taking charge of grant-related matters following the departure of the CTO, sets the backdrop for our examination. The report delves into critical aspects, including the allocation of the granted 100,000 OP tokens, an assessment of the team‚Äôs execution of the proposed activities, identification of any missing wallet addresses, and additional insights gleaned from our investigation.Additionally, we provide observations and analyses related to the implementation of the grant and offer recommendations to optimize the utilization of the grant for the sustained growth of Via Protocol and Optimism. This report aims to provide a clear understanding of the current state of affairs and offer actionable insights for the betterment of Via Protocol‚Äôs grant initiative.MethodologyThe analysis presented in this report is the culmination of a thorough investigation, drawing from a diverse range of sources. These sources include:Block Explorers and Smart Contracts:We extensively utilized block explorers to trace transactions and verify the allocation of the 100,000 OP tokens. Smart contract interactions were scrutinized to understand fund movements and allocation mechanisms.Via Protocol Website:The official website was consulted to cross-verify pertinent information regarding the grant proposal, team composition, and project milestones.Via Protocol GitHub Repositories:The repositories, specifically ‚Äòvia-sdk-js‚Äô and ‚Äòvia-landing‚Äô, were examined for active development and contributions. This provided insights into the project‚Äôs technical progress.Via Protocol Social Media:Social media channels were monitored for official announcements, updates, and community interactions. This helped in gauging the level of engagement and transparency of the grant initiative.Dune Analytics for Smart Contract Analysis:Dune Analytics was leveraged for a detailed examination of smart contracts related to Via Protocol. This facilitated a granular understanding of contract interactions and fund movements.Galxe Campaigns:Information related to the Galxe campaigns, including participation numbers, was gathered from official sources. This provided context on community engagement efforts.CEO and CTO Social Media Presence:Social media profiles of the CEO and ex-CTO were scrutinized for any public statements, updates, or insights regarding Via Protocol. This provided additional context on project developments.Optimism Collective Forum:The forum was a crucial resource for accessing details about grant proposals, milestones, and the project‚Äôs interactions with the Optimism community.By collating data from these diverse sources, we aimed to ensure a comprehensive and multi-faceted analysis of Via Protocol‚Äôs Phase 1 grant proposal. This approach allowed us to cross-verify information and gain a holistic view of the project‚Äôs progress and activities.Where the granted 100K OP are sitting (This is the L2 recipient address: 0x1A27cdf069F2E8cc5b77b72BeA43851086aF5D83 and a related vault)The allocation of the granted 100,000 OP tokens has been meticulously tracked and examined. The tokens are currently secured in theVia Safe Multi-Sig Wallet at address 0xeC93157084dcE64F7E4c0F0EDF383114b5C805aA. This wallet employs a 2-threshold security measure, with two designated addresses assigned specific roles:L2 Recipient Address(0x1A27cdf069F2E8cc5b77b72BeA43851086aF5D83): This address serves as the primary recipient of the 100,000 OP tokens.Owner-2 Address(0x67E785af25156A1dcDB4920e0Cb72d22204F096A):Additionally, two other addresses are significant in this context:Airdrop Contract Creator(0xA256661Ca438e102Ec27ac49FA107308D7F992bF)Airdrop Contract(0x41bC6b41Fb617220263871B9F7c4ba35F9A45417)A chronological overview of key transactions involving the granted OP tokens is as follows:March 18, 2023:250,000 OP tokens weretransferredto the L2 recipient address.March 18, 2023:These 250,000 OP tokens weretransferredinto the Safe Multi-Sig Wallet.March 29, 2023:Atransaction of 150,000 OP tokens was initiated, directing them back to the Optimism Foundation.May 5, 2023:3310 OP tokens weretransferredto Owner-2.May 25, 2023:1000 OP tokens weretransferredto Airdrop Contract3310 OP tokens weretransferredto Airdrop Contract.As of the current assessment, the Via Safe Multi-Sig Wallet stands with a balance of 95,690 OP tokens. Concurrently, the Airdrop Contract 2584 OP tokens.1313√ó441 27.3 KB2. Has the team executed on what‚Äôs listed on the grant proposal and the outcome?The original proposal outlined a commitment to distribute 100% of incentives to users through two distinct initiatives:Here are the initial proposed milestones:30% (75,000 $OP) - Swap Gas refunds for trades on Via router, for as long as there is money.70% (175,000 $OP) - Long-term stimulation for users to bridge to Optimism. Will be only available for bridging to Optimism ETH, Stable Coins, or OP (should be discussed).These proposed milestones were subsequently updated, incorporating valuable insights from the community. The updated milestones provided in the comments section of the Optimism Collective Forum are:Milestone 1: Refund gas to 50,000 users or 75,000 of OP, whichever occurs first. Via will provide documentation to the Grants Council to make it easy to verify.Milestone 2: Distribute the remaining OP earmarked for gas refunds within 6 months of the initial OP grant funding in a manner it considers appropriate.Milestone 3: At least 25,000 new users or $30,000,000 bridges in volume. Max 50,000 users. Have a connection with at least 3 projects for this campaign.Via will provide documentation to the Grants Council to make it easy to verify.Milestone 4: On the completion of all other milestones, Via will submit a brief summary of results to the Grants Council. This should be completed no later than 6 months after receipt of OP tokens, even if some milestones are incomplete.To accomplish these milestones Galxe campaigns were run from April 4, 2023, to June 29, 2023. Here are the campaigns run on the platform:1282√ó622 37.2 KBThe Contract Address for this OP Grants Quests is0xF36Fb607E0B54F56acc5085357D2218Fc8DE4D1D1280√ó720 28.7 KB1280√ó720 29.7 KB1280√ó720 64.8 KBWhile it is unclear as to what the NFT owners would receive,the nft-drop-faq channel on Via Discord server mentions that the NFT owner will become a Via Chad and it may provide some additional advantages in the near future.Apart from this, we have delved deep into the contract address that Refunds the gas fee in OP for any swap or bridge on Via Exchange.

Add missing wallet addresses related to via protocol here and in the Notion TrackerThe Airdrop contract address, i.e. Distributor Address, will be pushed to the Github repo.4. Anything else you can uncover?In the course of our analysis, several additional observations have come to light, offering further context to Via Protocol‚Äôs current status:GitHub Repositories:Via Labs‚Äô GitHub presence encompasses a total of 14 public repositories. Notably, the core repositories, ‚Äòvia-sdk-js‚Äô and ‚Äòvia-landing‚Äô, have remained without active public commits over the past year. This suggests a potential slowdown in development activity in these specific areas.Team Dynamics Shift:The CTO who is also one of the founders has resigned from the team. However there is no official announcement regarding this except for in the Optimism Collective Forum. Consequently, the distribution of responsibilities within the team in light of this development remains undisclosed.Community Interaction:The protocol seems to be engaging with the community with their recent tweets about the OP Claim and benefits of NFT holders from the Galxe Campaign.These additional insights contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Via Protocol‚Äôs current landscape.Current Snapshot as on 17th Sept, 20231584√ó1600 279 KBFollowing the receipt of funding on March 18th, 2023, the grant initiative was set in motion on May 25th, 2023. The first transaction from the Airdrop contract also took place on the same day, marking the commencement of the grant‚Äôs distribution.As of September 17th, 2023, a total of approximately 1730 OP tokens have been claimed. The average daily claim rate stands at 24 OP tokens.At the current rate, the 100,000 OP token grant is anticipated to last forapproximately 4500 days.Even witha tenfold surge in the volume of bridges and swaps, the grant is projected to endure for anestimated 450 days.Observations & AnalysisThe user interface (UI) of the Via Protocol application is commendable and stands on par, if not ahead, of industry standards. Transactions are executed smoothly and with cost efficiency, contributing to an overall positive user experience.In order to thrive in a competitive market where similar services abound, a growth strategy is essential. Allocating a portion of the grant towards content creation and targeted marketing can draw in new users, establish brand trust, and sustain product integrity. Any reallocations of grant funds for purposes beyond the original intent should be transparently communicated to the grants council, prioritizing the potential for holistic network and product expansion.It is crucial to acknowledge that without substantial growth, the grant may remain underutilized. This underscores the necessity for an effective growth strategy to ensure its maximum impact.",Summary not available

( not doable as it would require owning their token).What happened is that paraswap augustus swapper is taking users slippage set and taking that % as a fee that they collect to the DAO. The team also implies it was a ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù, the surplus refers to positive slippage in a swap, which is def. not the case here.In the following example they took a bit over 30% of the user swap to their fee collector (Arbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbiscan) .I don‚Äôt think its normal for a team at this stage and level to low tier-scam users out of their funds, specially after acknowledging the error is on their end. as i am writing this post has been over 5 days the team is reviewing my tx and muted/blocked me from contacting them, which leads me to believe this is a pure scam with intention.All users complaining in their community are left unanswered or in my case muted or blocked. It‚Äôs not okay for a team to steal user funds and puts all their effort in shuting down user, not fixing the problem. (the team even tried to fool users with fake explanations of what slippage and surplus are, which not coincide to their docs). They claim the surplus is the positive slippage but they are charging any amount of slippage user sets. (like the trade where they gobbled 30% of user funds on swap)Please take a deeper look and i am ready to provide a lot more information about this and evidences that support my appeal.How many users have been rolled by them and scammed by it without noticing really?","Paraswap's Augustus swapper is wrongfully confiscating user funds, specifically the slippage percentage set by users,  labeling it as a ""surplus"" to the DAO.  This is despite acknowledging the error.  The team's response involves ignoring or blocking complaints, demanding a governance vote (impossible for most users), and providing misleading explanations.  One user reported a 30% loss.  This behavior strongly suggests a deliberate scam, exploiting users and actively suppressing dissent.  Further investigation is needed to determine the full extent of affected users and losses.

The core product,yVault, are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market, each driven by one or more Strategies.Governance Fund Season/Cycle:Grant Season 2, Phase 1, Cycle 7Incentive Program Period: May 18, 2023 - February 22, 2024Distribution Plan for the OP Incentives: 25,000 OP tokens per week * 40 weeksWallet Funded:0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7KPIs for Incentive ProgramEnable 10 new partners on Optimism, including: Alchemix, QiDao, Swype, Rhino, Omni, Spool, Revest, Abra, DeFi Saver, TapiocaGrow Optimism to Yearn‚Äôs second highest TVL by chainKey TakeawaysThe Optimism Foundation allocated 1 million OP tokens to Yearn Finance Protocol, which Yearn will distribute 100% of grant $OP tokens to yVault depositors to incentivize the move to Optimism.25,000 OP tokens will be distributed weekly over the course of 40 weeks, starting on May 18th, 2023.Yearn successfully fulfills the second KPI outlined in the proposal by growing Optimism to Yearn‚Äôs second highest TVL by chain, within the span of just one month, highlighting a substantial positive impact of the OP incentive program on Yearn‚Äôs user engagement and presence on Optimism network.The incentive program successfully drew in new liquidity providers and encouraged active participation from existing users, with its TVL on Optimism surged from under $300K to over $14M, contributing to 2.3% of total TVL on Optimism in November. Optimism now became the second largest chain considering Yearn‚Äôs TVL by chain.After the launch of the incentive program we observed that there is a clear increase in both deposit activities, as the deposit transactions grew from nearly 50 to over 3K per week. yvUSDT and yvUSDC now have the largest user deposits of 1.5M yvUSDT and 1.2M yvUSDC respectively.As of November 19, 2023, Yearn distributed a total of 534,758 yvOP tokens as rewards, with 86% claimed by users already.Although Yearn has allocated a substantial portion of yvOP rewards to one of the vaults named ‚ÄúyvVelo-alETH-WETH-f,‚Äù user claim rate for these yvOP rewards is relatively low at 36%.OP Incentive DistributionThis part analyzed how the 1,000,000 OP tokens allocated to Yearn were used by tracking the transfer history of Yearn‚Äôs recipient wallet for OP grants (0xF5d9D6133b698cE29567a90Ab35CfB874204B3A7).On November 24, 2022, Yearn received the allocated 1,000,000 OP tokens from OP Foundations to launch its incentive program.1600√ó130 49.4 KBThen the 1 million OP tokens were deposited into yvOP vaults with four distinct transactions of 50K, 250K, 250K, and 450K OP tokens. These OP tokens are deposited to get yvOP tokens as actual incentives that will be added to Yearn vaults.1600√ó356 113 KBThen, we tracked the total yvOP tokens deposited into and distributed to OP boosted Yearn vaults from the funded wallet by week, following the distribution plan Yearn proposed (25K OP tokens * 40 weeks).As the chart below shows, the blue bar denotes instances where Yearn deposited 1 million OP tokens into the yvOP. Due to the transaction fees, about 993,699 yvOP tokens were generated in total. The orange bars represent the yvOP token incentives added to OP boosted Yearn vaults each week.1354√ó806 78.8 KBThe area chart below shows the remaining yvOP in the funded wallet awaiting for distribution. In general, the distribution process is continuous and steady.1600√ó879 65.6 KBAs of November 19, 2023, Yearn deployed a total of 534,758 yvOP tokens as rewards in the past 27 weeks, among which 460,863 yvOP tokens are already claimed by users. There are still 459K yvOP tokens awaiting for distribution in the following 23 weeks.1600√ó194 74.6 KBOP Incentives Breakdown by yVaultsYearn‚Äôs core product is yVault, which refers to capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market, each driven by one or more strategies.The OP token incentives, as detailed in the Yearn‚Äôs proposal, will be used to reward users deposited their assets in yVaults on Optimism.Given this, we parsed Yearn vault‚Äôs contract address on Optimism fromYearn‚Äôs data API, and labeled OP boosted vaults based on whether the vault rewarding contracts received OP tokens from Yearn‚Äôs funded wallet.Overall, there are 92 Yearn vaults (test contract excluded) created on Optimism, while 41 vaults, nearly a half, have been set with OP incentives.|624.0000000000001x1911600√ó488 59.4 KBAfter tracking the yvOP tokens transferred from the funded wallet to other staking contracts, we identified all the rewards distribution contracts for each Yearn vaults.The transfer highlighted in blue below demonstrates two examples of refilling yvOP tokens into rewarding contract of yvUSDT vault (0xf66932f225ca48856b7f97b6f060f4c0d244af8e).1600√ó479 166 KBLooking into the yvOP token transfer history, the last transaction highlighted in blue is the first fillment of yvOP incentives into yvUSDT vaults. Then the three transactions highlighted in orange are examples where users claimed yvOP rewards from their deposit in the yvUSDT vault.1600√ó237 104 KBBased on the methodology detailed below, we then calculated the allocation of yvOPs across various OP boosted vaults. It is observed from the data that there is no apparent preferential treatment among the different vaults, indicating a relatively equitable distribution of yvOPs across all vaults (Mean = 11,162; Median = 9,650).1354√ó802 195 KB1348√ó796 156 KBBut we also observed an ineffective incentive in the yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f vault specifically. It was allocated the most 37,500 yvOP tokens as incentives, but only 36% were claimed by users. Compared to the claim rate over 90% of other vaults like yvUSDT, yvUSDC, etc, the efficiency of yvOP incentive for yvVelo-alETH-WETH-f appears to be relatively low. For future research, one should look into the possible reason for this irregularity.1600√ó511 131 KBOP Incentive ImpactTVLThe Total Value Locked (TVL) for Yearn Finance exhibited robust growth following its launch in July 2021, reaching a peak of nearly $7 billion in 2022. Starting around July 2022, the TVL remained relatively low, signaling a limited influx of capital into the protocol.In October 2022, Yearn Finance launched vaults on Optimism network, where the TVL stabilized at approximately $300K. During this period, Ethereum and Fantom emerged as the predominant chains for Yearn with the highest TVL of nearly $442 million and $16 million respectively.1600√ó487 65.9 KB1600√ó477 82.6 KBFollowing the initiation of the OP incentive program on May 18th, the TVL of Yearn on Optimism surged, which indicated heightened interest and active engagement with Optimism within Yearn. As demonstrated in the charts, Yearn‚Äôs TVL on Optimism reached nearly $14.17 million just after one month since the launch of the incentive program, surpassing Fantom and establishing itself as the second-highest TVL chain on Yearn. This reflects the fulfillment of the second Key Performance Indicator (KPI) outlined in Yearn‚Äôs proposal within the span of just one month, highlighting a substantial positive impact of the OP incentive program on Yearn‚Äôs user engagement and presence on Optimism network.1600√ó497 92.8 KBThrough an analysis of Yearn‚Äôs overall TVL composition on Optimism, we observed that Yearn‚Äôs contribution to Optimism‚Äôs TVL has increased from 0.03% before the incentive program to 3% after the incentive program in August, stabilizing at 2.3% in November.1600√ó1015 69.6 KB1600√ó1023 73 KBSource:DefilamaBy August, TVL of Yearn on Optimism chain reached its highest peak at approximately $30 million, indicating the effectiveness of the incentive program. The incentive program successfully drew in new liquidity providers and encouraged active participation from existing users, resulting in a substantial boost of TVL.User ActivitiesAfter the launch of the incentive program on May 18, 2023, a substantial increase in user transactions was observed across both OP boosted vaults and non-OP boosted vaults. We also observed an unusual peak in the user transactions with OP boosted vaults in April 2023. Although we are not able to perform a comprehensive exploration of the specifics of these transactions due to the time constraints, one plausible explanation for this surge could be attributed to the deployment of yvOP rewards for vaults and test transactions with these OP boosted vaults.1600√ó709 71.1 KBWhen delved into the breakdown of user transactions specifically within OP boosted vaults, an interesting pattern was found in user deposit and withdrawal. After May, there is a clear increase in deposit transactions compared to withdrawals from OP boosted vaults.1600√ó692 75.3 KBUser Deposits and WithdrawalsBased on the user transactions with vaults, we conducted an analysis of token amounts deposited and withdrawn from each vault over time, as visually represented in the chart below.Overall, users deposited more than they withdrew from the vault. Most of the deposits happened before July 2023, while the trading token amounts saw a decrease after August.1600√ó691 64.2 KBIf broken down by vaults, we can find that yvUSDT and yvUSDC are the hottest tokens with the largest trading amount historically.1600√ó700 120 KBAs of November 19, 2023, yvUSDC, yvDAI, yvUSDT and yvMAI are the OP boosted vaults with the highest user deposits.1600√ó675 133 KB*It is worth noting that currently we haven‚Äôt included token value for LP tokens nor calculated trading volume in USD or ETH, so there‚Äôs still limitations when comparing user deposits in different vaultsRecommendationsEnhance communication and awareness. Despite the success in drawing in new liquidity providers, the relatively low user claim rate, demonstrated in theyvVelo-alETH-WETH-fvault, indicates a potential gap in user awareness. Implementing targeted communication, providing clearer instructions, and enhancing resources could help bridge this gap and improve user participation.Closing RemarksThe incentive of Yearn plans to last for 40 weeks starting from May 18, 2023. During the past 27 weeks, Yearn has deployed over half of the overall OP grants (534,758 yvOP tokens) as rewards for OP boosted vaults, among which 86% (460,863 yvOP tokens) were already claimed by users.The KPI set by Yearn in its proposal to make Optimism the second largest chain of Yearn by TVL was realized in one month after the incentive program. The significant increase in Yearn TVL on Optimism by chain as well as its contribution to Optimism‚Äôs TVL both showed the effectiveness of the OP incentive program.ResourcesYearn Incentive Analysis Dashboardby @wyeeehOP Analytics RepoIncentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc@optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive(OP Mainnet)DefiLlamaOptimism TVL (Included liquidity staking TVL & double count in TVL calculation)Yearn TVL across chainsYearnYearn WatchAPI",Summary not available
Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,Incentive Impact Analysis: Velodrome,https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-velodrome/7251,"Authors:@blockchainatusc@sator@pancakes_mikey@ericf@RSRaiProgram InformationVelodrome FinancePhase 1, Cycle 8, Season 2Date Funded: November 25, 2023Wallet Funded:0xb074ec6c37659525EEf2Fb44478077901F878012Key TakeawaysVelodrome Finance was mostly successful in accomplishing its set KPIs in the original proposal.Although several metrics exhibited anomaly spikes and dips, the result of this delegation was a consistent increase in activity across all metrics.Taking a closer look into the reason for these spikes could provide more insight into the incentive program.Distribution:As discussed in theoriginal proposal, Velodrome distributed its 4 million OP in three methodologies with their respective KPIs.1. Locking Incentives - 37.5% (1.5 M OP): incentives for $VELO holders to lock their tokens for $veVELO, bootstrapping liquidity for the existing and new protocols.KPIs:Exceeding and maintaining 70% VELO total supply lockedDoubling the share of OP protocols locking VELO among those with native tokensAttracting additional new protocols to the ecosystem that meaningfully improve layer-wide economic activity2. Bribe Matching - 37.5% (1.5 M OP): bribe matching protocols help beat competition, attract more protocols due to Velodrome‚Äôs lower price to bribe, and add liquidityKPIs:Increasing the total number of protocols bribingIncreasing number of total pools bribedIncreasing the total value bribed in $ / ETH terms3. Building Deep Liquidity - 25% (1M OP): supporting velodrome emissions for key public good pools.KPIs:Increasing TVL for ecosystem pairsHigh number of transactionsLow slippage for high volume trades862√ó722 22.4 KBGeneral MetricsTVL:Source:https://defillama.com/protocol/velodrome1600√ó581 93.9 KBSince the first OP Grant was awarded to Velodrome, their TVL has increased exponentially, starting at ~$25 million and recently hovering at the $150 million mark. Since its delegation in November 2022, the TVL has experienced volatility but remains slightly above its initial value. Although TVL is a general metric that can be applied across multiple different protocols, it is especially important to consider for Velodrome, as high liquidity is one of their goals in being a successful DEX for Optimism.Metrics for Locking IncentivesVelo and veVELO Supply:1600√ó635 68.1 KBSource:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-teamThe circulating supply of $VELO and the total supply of $veVELO are steadily increasing. The initial veVELO supply spike is explained by the update from V1 to V2 as data was transferred. Theoretically, as the veVELO supply increases, the VELO supply should correspondingly decrease. However, the VELO supply is increasing more than veVELO because the increasing number of VELOs is proportional to the emissions reward levels that Velodrome awards LPs with. The circulating VELO supply is beginning to diverge from the VeVELO supply.New Pools Created:1600√ó628 45.9 KBSource:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-teamThe number of new pairs created (pools) since the OP grant exhibited its highest levels around February of 2023. The number of new pairs has recently reverted to the value during the beginning of the delegation. The number of pairs created is indicative of an increasing number of new token pools employed on Velodrome. This is an implicit measure of bribing as well, as the number of bribes is proportional to the number of new pools created.Metrics for BribingVelodrome Bribes per Day:1600√ó795 57.6 KBSource:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-analytics-usc-governance-teamVelodrome has exhibited a consistent number of daily bribes since its delegation disregarding the outliers in August 2022, September 2022, and June 2023. Before November 2022, a few spikes indicated a significant increase in activity. After the OP delegation, we saw more consistent users, instead of a high rate of users during certain periods.Fees and Bribe Rewards:1600√ó633 102 KBSource:https://dune.com/0xkhmer/bribes-warThe absolute value of bribes has exhibited volatility since the OP delegation, peaking in between the 56-64 epoch. Although volatile, Bribes are at significantly higher levels since the OP delegation.1324√ó441 39.5 KBSource:Change in Pools‚Äô Bribes on Velodrome from 6/2022 - 11/2023 (dune.com)Last August, there was an increase in pools bribed. Aside from a spike in June 2023, and a few instances of increased pool activity in December 2022, February 2023, and September 2023, it seems that a lot of pools are losing their bribes and that perhaps activity has decreased from the protocol end of utilizing velodrome.Metrics for LiquidityTransaction Number:1600√ó519 59.5 KBSource:https://dune.com/queries/3181585/5313302The graph depicts the number of transactions over time for Velodrome, starting from June 2022 to November 2023. There are notable spikes in transaction volume, with the highest peaks occurring around August 2022. After these peaks, the transaction volume shows some volatility but tends to decrease overall, with occasional smaller spikes. There‚Äôs a pattern of fluctuating activity with no other peaks reaching the same height as those in August 2022. The overall trend suggests periods of high activity followed by stabilization, with the highest number of transactions concentrated in the earlier months, particularly August 2022.Slippage Rate:1600√ó460 42.6 KBSource:https://dune.com/queries/3181602/5313347The graph shows the slippage rate for Velodrome from early June 2022 to late November 2023. The slippage rate is generally low, hovering close to zero, but several extreme spikes exceed 300 at certain points. The most notable spike occurs around late August 2022, with another significant peak around late January 2023. After these spikes, the slippage rate returns to lower levels, with some minor fluctuations over time. The extreme values suggest instances of high volatility or possible anomalies in transaction processing or liquidity within the Velodrome platform during those times.User MetricsDaily Active WalletsSource:Token Terminal | Fundamentals for crypto1600√ó864 115 KBThis chart displays the active daily wallets on Velodrome. Although the numbers remain consistent, there have been several recent spikes in user count. It is important to note that wallets and users are not always 1:1. A user can have multiple wallets, as well as bots.Daily Trading Volume:Token Terminal | Fundamentals for crypto1600√ó834 132 KBInterestingly, the daily trading volume is slightly inverted compared to daily active wallets. The highest levels exhibited from March to April of 2023. Although there was a slight drop-off after these dates, the numbers have remained relatively consistent. It is also important to note that the daily trading volume overall increased exponentially since the OP delegation.AnalysisLocking IncentivesThe KPIs were successfully met for the incentivization of locking VELO. According to the supply of VELO and veVELO graph, 70% of VELO‚Äôs supply has remained locked, with consistent levels hovering around 75% of the supply locked. Additionally, a large number of new protocols have been added to the ecosystem which is displayed by the new pairs count graph. There has been a consistent number of new pools created since the delegation. Velodrome was successful in its own terms delegating its OP to increase locking incentives.BribingSimply put, on average, bribes and fees have increased and average bribes on a per day basis have increased, albeit marginally, since the OP drop on November 25th. The total change in pools bribed has increased, from the pre-drop average of -6.25 bribes per month, to -2 bribes per month, thus the OP drop has been effective on that front.It could mean that the OP‚Äôs utilization through the bribe matching incentive is working. Thus the need for so many bribes becomes inefficient, because the pools that protocols were using were sufficiently liquid, or the other pathways for distribution may have been affected by the switch.Regardless, immediately after the OP delegation, we see an increase in consistent users, and then after the shift, we see a slight dip. So at least for a while, it seems that bribe matching was more efficient and there was a good amount of demand and utilization over a 8-month period.LiquidityThe provided histogram for transaction volume on Velodrome from June 2022 to November 2023 can be analyzed to understand the impact of the ‚ÄúBuilding Deep Liquidity‚Äù initiative. To assess the high number of transactions, a key performance indicator (KPI) for the initiative, we look for peaks in the graph that represent increased activity. These peaks would be indicative of successful incentivization if they align with the timing of the OP distributions to support key public good pools.Upon examination, several spikes in transaction volume are apparent, which may correspond with periods following the distribution of incentives. These are the taller bars in the histogram, suggesting a temporary surge in transactions. However, to truly meet the KPI, these spikes would need to demonstrate sustainability, meaning the high volume is not just a short-term reaction but is maintained over time. The general downtrend in transaction volumes towards the end of the period suggests that the incentivization impact may wane, requiring continuous efforts to sustain engagement.Comparing these peaks with the troughs‚Äîperiods of lower transaction volumes‚Äîprovides additional insight. The troughs could reflect the natural fluctuation in trading activity or periods with reduced or absent incentives. A baseline transaction volume should be established, which can be done by assessing the level of activity before the incentive program began. This would help in understanding the true elevation in activity due to the initiative.Finally, while the histogram focuses on transaction counts, a comprehensive analysis should also consider external factors that can affect trading volumes, such as overall market conditions and other economic events, which could lead to an increase or decrease in transactions independent of the incentives provided.Slippage RateThe histogram displaying Velodrome‚Äôs slippage rate from June 2022 to November 2023 provides insights pertinent to the platform‚Äôs KPI of maintaining low slippage rates, especially for high-volume trades. The goal of this KPI, alongside the ‚ÄúBuilding Deep Liquidity‚Äù initiative which allocated 1 million OP to bolster key public good pools, is to ensure that large transactions can be executed without significantly affecting the market price.A cursory analysis reveals that most of the data points are clustered close to the baseline, indicating that Velodrome typically maintains a low slippage rate. This is an affirmative sign of a liquid market where users can expect their trades to be executed at prices close to their expectations. Such a condition is favorable for traders and is indicative of a healthy trading environment that the initiative aims to foster.However, the graph also shows several pronounced spikes where the slippage rate exceeds the general low baseline by a substantial margin. These peaks are critical to analyze, as they represent instances where traders experienced higher-than-expected slippage. The reasons behind these peaks could range from market-wide volatility, substantial trades that momentarily outstrip the available liquidity or periodic events that induce larger-than-usual trading volumes.The frequency and timing of these spikes could yield deeper insights. If the spikes align with known high-volume trading periods or follow incentive distributions, this might suggest that while the initiative is successful in attracting volume, it may simultaneously strain the liquidity pools, resulting in higher slippage. Conversely, if the spikes do not correspond with such periods, they may be attributable to external market factors or isolated large transactions that are less reflective of the overall market condition.To address these spikes and enhance the platform‚Äôs resilience against high slippage incidents, it would be crucial for Velodrome to analyze the specific conditions under which these peaks occur. By understanding these conditions, Velodrome could implement strategies to further deepen liquidity or introduce mechanisms to better absorb large trades, thereby aligning with the KPI of ensuring low slippage even during high volume trade periods.RecommendationsProviding additional OP for locking VELO proved to be successful, as there was a steady amount of users locking their VELO. However, we are beginning to see a slight divergence in the supply of VELO and veVELO. Examining the journey of this divergence should allow for additional insight into this incentive program.For a more comprehensive analysis of liquidity, additional data linking the OP distribution events to transaction volumes would be needed, especially to assess if these peaks align with the distribution of incentives and to evaluate the sustainability of the transaction volumes as a key performance indicator for the initiative‚Äôs success.Looking holistically at all of the graphs regarding both user metrics and KPI analysis, there seems to be a consistent spike in metrics whether it be the number of transactions, daily active wallets, or number of bribes in the spring months of 2023. Examining this cause could provide insight into how to increase incentivization among users.Source:https://dune.com/usc-blockchain-club/velodrome-incentive",Summary not available

It has become a key infrastructure player, significantly enhancing scalability and user experience. As part of its growth strategy, OP Mainnet has distributed OP tokens via grants to select protocols, with Stargate Finance being one of the top recipients. The aim of this report is to perform a detailed analysis of Stargate Finance‚Äôs utilization of these granted OP tokens. We‚Äôll investigate how these tokens and any co-rewards have been deployed to incentivize usage and liquidity on OP Mainnet. This includes an examination of key performance indicators, wallet behavior, and user retention in scenarios with and without incentives.Dune Dashboard:Dune LinkReport:Gitbook LinkStargate FinanceWhat is Stargate Finance?According to Stargate‚Äôs website, ‚ÄúStargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol that lives at the heart of Omnichain DeFi.‚Äù Great, but let‚Äôs translate that into plain English for those who aren‚Äôt immersed in crypto 24/7. Simply put, Stargate serves as a bridge protocol, enabling users to move cryptocurrency tokens between distinct blockchains (for instance, transferring ETH from Optimism to Polygon). These bridges are foundational elements crucial for the expansion of Layer 2 networks like Optimism. They simplify the onboarding process for new users, offering a more straightforward path to get involved in L2 ecosystems.How were the OP Grant Funds Distributed?From the 1,000,000 OP tokens granted to Stargate, 700,000 were earmarked for a Liquidity Mining Program. Thesis: Deeper liquidity ensures users can enjoy reduced slippage as they are bridging between networks.On August, 1st 2022 Stargate paused their existing liquidity mining reward system (STG) and on August, 5th 2022 initiated OP rewards for liquidity mining.The remaining 300,000 tokens were reserved for Qualified Partners who help integrate Stargate into their project.As of October, 1st 2023, Stargate still has 368,999 OP tokens within their Multisig safe (0x392AC17A9028515a3bFA6CCe51F8b70306C6bd43)AnalysisLiquidity Mining OP RewardsLet‚Äôs evaluate how the activation of OP liquidity mining rewards starting on August, 5th 2023 impacted Stargate bridge activity. The total bridge volume on OP Mainnet experienced a significant increase, rising from $16 million to $36 million between July and August, representing a growth rate of 125%. The Volume sustained this range into September and October before resuming an upwards trajectory. We see a similar trend for bridge volumetoOP Mainnet.

The Stargate multisig wallet still holds a significant balance of 368,999 OP tokens to distribute, and many of the deployed rewards haven‚Äôt fully matured yet. While we did observe a spike in OP Mainnet bridge volume coinciding with the activation of OP rewards, it‚Äôs worth noting that other incentives‚Äîspecifically, STG rewards‚Äîwere already in play and swapped out for OP rewards.

Accountability  üóÇÔ∏è,L2DAO Investigation: Summary,https://gov.optimism.io/t/l2dao-investigation-summary/5719,"To keep things neat I‚Äôve moved my own research into its own thread. Details below:I‚Äôve identifiedwhat I think is the origin of the second transferof 27,500 OP to a multisig governed by L2DAO‚Äôs principals, who then market dump that OP for USDC.This snapshot completes strong onchain and firsthand evidence that:NFTEarth and this second multisig, called LFGROW, share leadership teams with L2DAO and can be said to be indistinguishable from it as far as management is concernedLayer2DAO principals govern the multisigs dumping OP for USDC and proceeding with other onchain activities apparently inconsistent with the grant‚Äôs intention and violating the no-sale rule (regardless of whether it was in force when this grant was made)I am going to selectively quote the linked proposal authorizing this transfer here, emphases mine:This is a proposal to the Layer2DAO community tocreate a new DAO focused exclusively on educational and tooling solutions for L2 NFT creators, artists and owners.In addition to education; the new DAO would havea clear focus on connecting the new knowledge gained by creators/artists/owners to easily accessible infrastructureleading to pragmatic results and the proliferation of NFT development on Layer2 Ethereum. This initiative is torevive and support active NFTs creation (and thus trading)on L2 chains, which have a lot of benefits ‚Äúby design‚Äù vs. Mainnet. NFTEarth is focusing on trading, however, without active creators/projects, there will be no trading; 2. If you are not having huge funding (to be able to develop everything on your own), as a creator/project, you need to use certain tools to create and promote your collections. Unfortunately, most of the tools available in the market as well information are not ‚Äútailored‚Äù to L2 and are scattered around.Most needed tools are ‚Äì NFT Generator, Allow/WL list/raffles tool, Launchpad and specific in this case: tool to migrate NFTs from L1 ‚Üí L2.So this is supposed to be a separate DAO that receives this grant. However,this purportedly separate DAO comprises the exact same signers as NFTEarth and, like NFTEarth, cannot be credibly determined to be an arm‚Äôs-length ecosystem project, as the multisig is controllable by Layer2DAO signers.Trainclaims in his responsethe following:Layer2DAO response to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]NFT Earth, while having some of the same team members (notably Weston), was and is a separate organization that was voted on by the OPIncubator NFT holders and approved as a grant recipient. This was not and is not the same organization that received the Phase 0 grant (Layer2DAO). Exosphere and I were asked if we wanted to join as advisors, which we accepted.Train‚Äôs claim downplaying their role is misleading and demonstrably untrue. The shapshot‚Äôs author, 0xadventurer (whose identity could be an alt of a known principal given the relative lack of historic activity in L2DAO), says so themselves:funds will be sent to multi-sig controlled by current L2DAO leaders, for them to oversee fund distribution.This proves by the author‚Äôs admission thatNFTEarth, whose multisig is identical to the one described here, is in fact run by Layer2Dao‚Äôs principals. This is proof that the Layer2DAO team market sold granted OP on two separate occasions.A follow-up post will describe in greater detail what this wallet has in fact been doing. Suffice it to say it calls into question the stated intentions of the grant.As a reminder, Layer2DAO‚Äôsoriginal proposalstates:Layer2DAO‚Äôs stated mission as a DAO is to expand the Ethereum L2 ecosystem and invest in L2 ecosystem projects. As such the DAO aims to use part of its Optimism Fund grant to incentivize high-impact Optimism protocols.Layer2DAO is proposing to use 240,000 OP tokens to create the OPIncubator project that will incentivise projects that run on Optimism.I think anyone would take this to suggest that this grant is intended to incentivizeoutsideprojects in the ecosystem. If L2DAO had spun up 6 entities with the same two principals and gave them OP to be market dumped, I think that would be correctly understood to be against the spirit of the application or the Grant program as a whole.What we have here is just this, for at least 2 subgrants (research ongoing).Finally, I‚Äôm not going to address Train‚Äôs claims about me, but I do want to make an illustrative point here. Train quotes me to claim that I am being inconsistent in my application of Grant guidelines:Layer2DAO response to allegations from Velodrome / OptiChads [March 2023]Jack‚Äôs own words in response to a OPIncubator recipient was:‚ÄúMy understanding (and it could be flawed here) is that Decentragora has every right to do whatever it wants with the given OP ‚Äì their reception in my mind is indistinguishable from someone receiving liquidity mining rewards‚Äù.This is a crucial point I want to make. Decentragora is aseparate organizationthat, after interviewing its principals, I judged to becompletely at arm‚Äôs length from L2DAO. They do not pose the same risk of self-dealing that I am observing in L2DAO‚Äôs self-granting two ecosystem grants, one for NFTEarth and one ostensibly for this other DAO described above. Surely anybody can tell the difference here.But don‚Äôt worry, of course, the Layer 2 Dao team assures you that the funds are in good hands:Moreover ‚Äì here is my promise that I personally will not ‚Äútake‚Äù any penny from this initial LTIP-7 funding. I‚Äôm not doing this for short term benefit, I‚Äôm doing this for L2 and way too bigger aims/goals! With this new initiative, we would like to support NFTEarth focus on the Layer2 NFTs market development as well as grow the L2 NFT ecosystem in general!Future disclosure will discuss what in fact has occurred on these multisigs.Original postI can distill some of this info@Dicasopresents into what I think is the key fact here:There aretwo multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market dump OP. If you grant that one of these is ostensibly NFTEarth‚Äôs official multisig receiving an L2DAO grant, I can‚Äôt find public justification for the second.Regardless of what these addresses then did (among other things, sell OP for USDC), the ownership of these multisigs is what to focus on.Layer 2 Dao‚Äôs multisig isSafe ‚Äì Settings ‚Äì Setup‚Äì addresses are:0xD131F1BcDd547e067Af447dD3C36C99d6be9FdEB - westonnelson.eth0xE7a2d53dA40Ba37495d4Cf84811a59AAcE2f04A5 - wallet connected to exospherel2.eth0x1CabC3e62e0527cBe09917F5Ca8e6D9999502d820x357990585a6BB953DCBA126de48585ed27E22319 - wallet connected to exospherel2.ethThe first multisig, 0x56d, which we‚Äôll say is the main NFTEarth multisig,gets 27,500 OP from 0xaf5on Jan 10.

But because this is a 2/5 multisig, L2DAO principals can be said to control this wallet.Interestingly,an owner is removed and replacedon Feb 3. The previous owning address had been0xeafcb5b9f0be74296d89182c9915117e59882f2aand was evidently sunset on Optimism. It was replaced by0x119a849400dd8b61c8ab8995cb37af32dbbd2d8b, an active L2DAO owner called 0xadventurer.eth.This may be relevant because the previous day, the 2/4 L2DAO multisig performs asecondtransfer of 27,500 OPto adifferent2/5 multisig. The reasoning behind this transfer is unaccounted for and is suspicious because this multisig has theexact same signers as the first- i.e., it comprises Layer2DAO principals and is functionally controlled by L2DAO signers. This address also methodically dumps all of the sent OP.So there aretwo multisigs controlled by L2DAO signers that receive and market dump OP, and one of these transfers I can‚Äôt find public justification for.I think future research should uncover the actions and linkages involving these multisigs and their signers, and I call on@0xWestonor@Exosphereto explain why there are two identical multisigs, both with L2DAO signers, that receive and sell large amounts of OP.This of course in addition to assembling further information on what ultimately gets done with the funds once they are swapped to USDC.",Summary not available

This can be addressed by transparent reporting by the grantees.Project Specific Observations.The Optimism grant has definitely unlocked the growth of Perpetual Protocol, adding a member to the ecosystem where the benefits can be shared later if not now.The Perpetual team has kept the flow of rewards and transactions clean compared to other grantees. Being one of the largest recipients of the grant, the team stands ready for the tailwind.DistributionTwitter AnnouncementAs originally proposed, distribution was to be carried out in three broad heads with Liquidity Mining using 8M OP and builder Acquisition using the remaining 1M OP.The following distribution is as we see it and the numbers are as it happened.Liquidity Acquisition:are incentive for lenders to lend any type of collateral to the Market Making Entity (1.8mn)2**. Liquidity Mining:** are incentive for market makers to ensure deep liquidity and the best experience for traders (5.7mn)Builder Acquisition:we will extend our current grants program and further incentivise builders to build on top of Perp and utilize Perp as a base layer (0.5mn)Note:-Retroactive is considered here as Long-term Liquidity Acquisition, incentivizing users to provide liquidity for similar surprises in the future. Pool Party Rewards are considered as Liquidity Mining1220√ó782 60.6 KBTotal Value LockedPerpetual has three products Trade, Vault & Stake. USDC is the main asset in the TVL as the Stake product attracts this liquidity. For trading Perpetual uses Uniswap V3‚Äôs liquidity pools, hence a large TVL on their side is not the only way to grow.1600√ó779 71.3 KBDaily Transactions1600√ó898 169 KBSource:-Daily TransactionsThe daily transaction activity for using Perpetual products exhibited notable spikes, with the highest surges occurring in November 2022 and subsequently in January 2023. These peaks in daily transactions reflect heightened user engagement and activity within the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem during these periods.Daily Transacting Addresses1600√ó894 149 KBSource:-Daily Transacting AddressesDuring the observed period from 22-09-2023 to 17-01-2023, there was a notable uptrend in daily transacting addresses within the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem. A significant peak in daily transacting addresses was recorded on 07-01-2023, reaching its highest point at approximately 13.25K, indicating heightened user engagement during that period.Prior to the initiation of the pool party reward program, the average daily transacting addresses stood at 228. However, after the introduction of this program, there was a substantial increase, with an average of 1082 daily transacting addresses, indicating a significant boost in user activity and engagement.Daily Network Fees Generated1600√ó900 55.7 KBSource:-Daily Network Fees GeneratedPrior to June 2023, the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem generated relatively modest daily network fees, consistently remaining below 1 ETH. However, a significant shift occurred in June 2023, marking a substantial increase in daily network fees, surpassing 1 ETH on a regular basis. This upward trajectory reached its zenith in August 2023, when daily network fees peaked at approximately 9.7 ETH.Reward Claimer Analysis1600√ó940 151 KBRetroactive OP Airdropü™ÇThis was one of the mostcontroversialdistributions as it was not mentioned in the proposal.

This statement aims to offer context to the forum discussion in which misappropriation was raised. However, it doesn‚Äôt fully resolve the discussion, as it was not examined through an investigative lens.In total around 1.3mn OP still remains unallocated in different addresses, including USDC. Considering Pool Party Rewards reduction in OP allocation, the funds usage in the near term is not available in the public forum.Grants disbursed to at least13 projectsby Perpetual will have a long term benefit for the mutual growth of Optimism and the grantee.This is impactful, wish to see remaining grants disbursed to more builders.The platform managed to draw in liquidity, possibly owing to its reward system. However, this influx of liquidity has proven instrumental in Perpetual‚Äôs efforts to enhance their project‚Äôs user interface and user experience, as well as to fortify themselves for future surges. This accomplishment can be viewed as just one of the numerous objectives the Optimism community anticipates from the grant recipient.RecommendationsRetroactive Distribution Procedure: Create a process for protocols to seek Governance Fund approval for retroactive OP distribution. The Governance Fund should have the option to approve or decline such requests.Timeline for grant distribution: Faster timeline can be enforced for the growth of the ecosystem and the grantee. At times, this can be the key for technical innovations too as it can attract more users.Grant Usage Guidelines: These can be established based on insights gained from previous grant allocations. This includes assessing the permissibility of actions like converting OP to another token or utilizing allocated OP for voting purposes.Closing RemarksConsidering the challenging circumstances the community and space have faced in the past year or so, the protocol has performed quite admirably.There is certainly room for improvement, but is it possible to reclaim the allocated funds in cases of delayed allocation or failure to meet specific parameters? This question arises from the observation that many past grants had a significant portion of their funds remaining unused in their wallets.Community can better answer it or there can be a stream of distribution from the foundation wallet, which can be stopped when clarification of funds use is in question. On second thought, after going through the grinding of a writing proposal and answering questions before it passes, autonomy to an extent shall also be granted to the teams.SourcesOP Analytics RepoIncentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc@optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive(OP Mainnet)Perpetual Protocol: Optimism Governance‚Äôs First FailureMessage to Optimism Community from Perpetual ProtocolIndependent Recovery PostI want to discuss project boosting their delegate power with governance fundhttps://perpprotocol.mirror.xyz/ForumSnapshotTwitter AnnouncementLiquidity MiningPerpetual Dashboard on DuneOptimism Deep-Dive by Project","Perpetual Protocol's Optimism grant ($9 million OP) aimed to boost liquidity and attract builders.

For background, see the analyses onSynthetixandPolynomial.Program InformationKwentaGovernance Fund Season/Cycle:Phase 0 Cycle 1Date(s) Funded:July 15, 2022Wallet Funded:0x82d2242257115351899894eF384f779b5ba8c695Key TakeawaysAfter seeing multiple protocols divert from their intended distribution, we‚Äôd like to gather community feedback on a process/steps that can be taken to prevent this in the future. We‚Äôd be happy to assist with developing a process for protocols to obtain approval from the Governance Fund to adjust the distribution method of OP in their proposal. Given the recipient‚Äôs obligation to the Governance Fund to uphold their proposed distribution, the Governance Fund or Grants Council should have the option to accept or decline any change requested to distributions (and request the return of allocated OP if terms can‚Äôt be met).Additionally, as multiple projects have diverted from their proposed distribution methods due to deprecated protocol offerings, it could be beneficial to implement prerequisites for future applicants insistent on having an implementation method (and any necessary internal approvals) before applying, ensuring the swift deployment of OP upon receipt.The lump sum distribution model is gameable and led to 22% of Kwenta trading coming on the day before the end of the epoch.IntroductionKwenta is a derivatives trading platform built on Synthetix Perps liquidity. Kwenta‚Äôs platform offers a front end for traders to gain exposure to over 60 assets with up to 50x leverage. Kwenta was among the first 24 projects funded by the Optimism Collective inProposal A: Governance Fund Phase 0 - Batch Votewith 900K OP on June 09, 2022. As seen with multiple other Governance Fund OP recipients (Polynomial,Synthetix,Rubicon), Kwenta‚Äôs distribution was altered after receiving funding. As this has become a recurring theme amongst funded protocols, we believe the logical next step is to design a process for protocols to adjust how they distribute their allocations. It is a great cause for concern that the funded parties feel no obligation to the Governance Fund when diverting from their proposed usage.1600√ó907 173 KBProposed DistributionPlatform Migration Incentives: 600K OP (66%)‚ÄúMethod: 1000 trader addresses who were unable to claim $DYDX and had a minimum deposit of $1000 USD in dYdX will be able to claim OP tokens after making 10 trades on Kwenta, generating a minimum PnL of 10%, and having a total cumulative volume of $5000 sUSD. 1200 wallets are eligible for this reward, the first 1000 people to claim the allocation will receive their OP.‚Äù (Source)Competition Prizes: 130K OP (14%)‚ÄúMethod: Kwenta will be hosting 2 competitions to kickoff the launch of the Kwenta token. The OP token will be used to incentivize participation by being added to the prize pool.‚Äù (Source)DAO Contributors: 170K OP (20%)‚ÄúMethod: Individuals who have contributed towards governance and development within the Kwenta DAO will receive 50% of the OP based on a Core Contributor-derived assessment of the value provided by the included members. 50% of the OP would put towards Kwenta devDAO bounties, incentivizing development on top of Kwenta and Optimism.‚Äù (Source)Actual Distribution1600√ó907 127 KBTrading Rewards: 600K OPConcurrent with Kwenta‚Äôs grant application in theOptimism forum, Kwenta publishedKIP 16, whichproposed a matching program for any approved OP distribution. This was reversed in September of 2022 when Kwenta passedKIP-29, effectively diverting the retroactive OP distribution to dYdX users due to complexities in implementation. KIP 29 established a useronboarding programutilizing quests. The proposed onboarding program rewarded users who completed quests by doing various tasks within the protocol. These quests provided a boost for traders who had historically used dYdX before the KIP 29 and those who had completed Kwenta‚Äôs Optimism (Galxe) Quest.Due to the ‚Äòdeprecation of V1 Cross Margin‚Äô (source), KIP 29 was never implemented and was eventually followed byKIP 61in April 2023. KIP 61 outlined a plan to provide trading rewards in conjunction with Synthetix OP trading rewards and was implemented from April 2023 to September 2023.1600√ó849 198 KB(Source)Implementing KIP 61 ultimately resulted in the distribution of 600K/900K of Kwenta‚Äôs OP allocation to trading rewards instead of the proposed ‚Äòplatform migration incentives.‚Äô As seen with theRubiconandPolynomialdistributions, Kwenta‚Äôs OP distribution method was changed due to the deprecation of its V1 Cross Margin and the lack of a plan to implement the proposed distribution to dYdX traders. Again, we‚Äôd like to emphasize the need for prerequisites before funding.Trading Competitions: 120K OPAs proposed, Kwenta directed 120K OP to two independent trading competitions promoting Kwenta product launches.The first competition was theMobile Launch Trading Competition, which allocated 20K OP to traders utilizing Kwenta‚Äôs mobile interface from August 16, 2022, to August 21, 2022. The results of this competition can be foundhere.TheCross-Margin Trading Competitionran from November 09, 2022, to November 23, 2022, which allocated 100K OP to the top 100 traders in terms of PnL. The results of this competition can be found in thisblog post, with a follow-up spreadsheethere.DAO Contributors: (?)The latestOP distribution outlineshows that 180K OP are still either earmarked for or have been distributed to DAO contributors. We assume that the OP has been at least partially distributed as outlined, but since the distribution addresses are not documented, we could not confirm with certainty.|476x349.460680012783141600√ó1181 432 KBOP Remaining: 53K OPThe multi-sigwalletKwenta sent 896K OP to (and presumably owns) still holds 53K OP.Program OverviewWith most rewards allocated to the trading rewards program beginning on April 19, 2023, we dove into the program‚Äôs impact on the OP network. As we‚Äôve seen massive increases with the other programs, the rewards program significantly impacted daily transactions and transacting addresses. However, it remains to be seen how sustainable the trading rewards will be, as Synthetix has extended the rewards with a modified program.Daily Transactions & Transacting AddressesKwenta accumulated over 393K transactions throughout the trading rewards program, averaging 2.7K daily. The average daily transactions during the program increased ~4x the average daily transactions of the 30D before (756). The return on the 393K transactions amounts to 1 transaction for every 1.5 OP spent.1600√ó907 191 KBThe number of daily transacting addresses on Kwenta also surged during the program, with the average daily transacting addresses increasing from 332/day 30D before to 512/day during, a 1.5x increase. Overall, the program returned one transacting address per ~8 OP spent.Incentive Impact Analysis: PolynomialBefore the introduction of the Synthetix OP rewards program, Polynomial accounted for approximately 3% of the total trading volume in Synthetix Perp. Polynomial‚Äôs share of Synthetix Perp trading volume dropped to 1.42% with the launch of Synthetix and Kwenta rewards. However, once Polynomial‚Äôs trading rewards programbeganon July 11, 2023, the platform‚Äôs share of Synthetix Perp trading volume shot up to an average of 31%.Likewise, Polynomial‚Äôs share of fees also rose significantly with the program‚Äôs launch, reaching 86% of daily fees generated. However, despite this significant spike, Kwenta still generated $8M more fees than Polynomial ($9.5M).1600√ó907 139 KBHowever, it‚Äôs worth acknowledging that (as noted in ourPolynomial Analysis) we saw Kwenta‚Äôs market share take a significant hit with the launch of Polynomial‚Äôs incentive program in July, which we see impacting both daily transactions and addresses in the second half of the program. While the amount of OP rewards was similar to that of Kwenta, Polynomial added a unique leveling mechanism for traders, along with trading competitions, and the small increase in rewards may have been enough to attract traders to the platform.Network Fees Generated1600√ó907 126 KBThroughout the program, Kwenta generated 89 ETH in network fees, returning 0.0001 ETH per OP spent on incentives. Before the program, Kwenta averaged 0.09 ETH/day in network fees generated, which increased by ~7X to an average of 0.62 during the program.It‚Äôs worth acknowledging that (as noted in ourPolynomial Analysis) we saw Kwenta‚Äôs market share take a significant hit with the launch of Polynomial‚Äôs incentive program in July, impacting daily transactions and addresses in the program‚Äôs second half.Deep-Dive: Tuesdays are for TradingAlso mentioned in ourPolynomial analysis, the addition of OP rewards from integrators such as Kwenta and Polynomial caused the weekly rewards to exceed that of which fees were paid (seen below).Incentive Impact Analysis: Polynomial1600√ó907 133 KBWe also observed that the increase in Polynomial‚Äôs trading volume far exceeded the increase in daily users, causing concern for inorganic trading (i.e., wash trading). As a result, we decided this made for a reasonable starting point with Kwenta as well.Incentive Impact Analysis: Polynomial1600√ó907 188 KBLooking into Kwenta‚Äôs volume compared with daily active traders, we see less aggressive spikes in trading volume compared to daily traders. The average daily traders increased from 324 traders 30D before the program to 329 traders during the program. The average daily trading volume increased from $83M to $127M.1600√ó870 250 KBWe found more modest spikes in Kwenta‚Äôs volume per trader, which averaged $251K the month before trading rewards and $379K during rewards. While this is a 1.5x increase, it pales compared to Polynomial‚Äôs volume/trader, which averaged $14K the month before rewards and $335K during rewards, a 24x increase. Insights following the Synthetix extendedrewards program, which began on September 13, will provide a clearer view of the program‚Äôs overall impact.1600√ó907 206 KBGiven the results of our past analysis, we expected large volume spikes along with the launch of rewards and wanted to get more granular on our previous analysis. To further investigate signs of inorganic trading, we found inspiration in@John_TV_Locke‚Äôs writing forMessari‚Äôs Synthetix quarterly report. In this report,Johnnypointed out that since rewards began on April 19, 2023, 24% of the Synthetix trading volume occurred on Tuesdays.924√ó661 215 KB(Source)Tuesdays are significant as it marks the last day of the Synthetix (and Kwenta) trading reward epoch. At the end of each epoch, Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC, a lump sum of 300K OP was distributed, divided amongst traders based on their fees. With this information, traders could more accurately gauge the rewards per $1 spent in fees closer to the end of the epoch (ie, Tuesday).Leveraging this insight, we dove deeper into the daily breakdown of trading volume throughout the trading rewards program. We were shocked to see the trading activity occurring on Tuesdays, in line with Johnny‚Äôs report. The cumulative volume on Tuesdays accounted for around 22% of the total volume throughout the trading rewards program ($4.1B).1600√ó907 134 KBWe found that the average daily volume on Tuesdays during the program was $189M, compared to an average of $25M before, an 8x increase. While the average volume overall increased from $27M to $121M, marking a 4.5x increase, the volume leading into the end of the epoch doubled that.1600√ó907 135 KBWhile this does not inherently suggest inorganic usage, it further solidifies points madein earlier reports. Despite this activity, Kwenta has more consistent trading throughout the rewards program than Polynomial, which could indicate the efficacy of either more extended programs (Kwenta) or adding trading competitions on top of incentives (Polynomial).Kwenta generated $18B in trading volume during the rewards program by distributing 600K OP, making the return for each OP spent ~$30K in trading volume. While impressive, this may prove hard to reproduce without the addition of Synthetix rewards underlying future programs.RecommendationsDistribution Alteration Process: We recommend developing a process for protocols to obtain approval from the Governance Fund to adjust the distribution method of OP in their proposal. Given the recipient‚Äôs obligation to the Governance Fund in upholding their proposed distribution, the Governance Fund should have the option to accept or decline the change request (and subsequently request the return of OP).Incentive Implementation Prerequisites: As multiple projects have diverted from their proposed distribution methods due to deprecated protocol offerings, it could be beneficial to implement prerequisites for future applicants insistent on having an implementation method (and any necessary for internal approvals) before applying, ensuring the swift deployment of OP upon receipt.Less Predictable Rewards Schedules: Due to the distribution of the lump sum of Kwenta and Synthetix OP rewards at 00:00 UTC every Wednesday, traders could game the rewards and take advantage of excessive rewards the day before. Perhaps a bit of randomness regarding distribution could have been helpful.Granular Analysis: While we‚Äôve seen with most programs, the protocols having distributed OP to date have proven capable of driving temporary usage metrics to spike but, in most cases, haven‚Äôt proven capable of sustaining. While the temporary spike in these metrics isn‚Äôt necessarily alarming, we believe the actual return on OP allocated comes from sustained usage, not temporary spikes. Luckily, one of the beautiful aspects of Optimism‚Äôs governance lies in the commitment to experimentation. Still, as Phase 0 and earlier programs conclude, the Governance House should seriously probe the efficacy of OP distributed to iterate upon these distribution methods.Closing Remarks:The OP incentives provided by Kwenta, in addition to the Synthetix program, ultimately increased the average daily traders and volume throughout the reward program but could have been impacted by the massive surges in Polynomial‚Äôs program. However, depending on a grant‚Äôs goals, the sustainability of these reward types suggests that future grants might benefit from more experimental and innovative designs.It‚Äôs difficult to assess the long-term effectiveness of ongoing programs. While some have claimed the increase of cumulative volume and fee revenue is an immediate success, we believe the evidence of more permanent trends will better indicate the success of the program for the OP ecosystem. Because fee revenue depends on volume, which was incentivized, it‚Äôs difficult to assess the protocol‚Äôs long-term revenue sustainability during the incentivized period. Following theextendedprogram‚Äôs conclusion (which caps rewards at a maximum of $1 OP reward per $1 in fees spent), we‚Äôd like to reassess the sustainability of these rewards over longer timeframes.Many perceived improvements to Kwenta‚Äôs program can be traced to the lack of transparency and accountability requirements of the Phase 0 program rather than to Kwenta itself. We‚Äôve expressed our interest in helping achieve this in any capacity possible and look forward to the community‚Äôs feedback on logical next steps.ResourcesOP Analytics RepoIncentive Program Performance Summary - Dune @oplabspbc@optimismfnd / Optimism Mainnet Project Deep-Dive(OP Mainnet)KwentaBlog: The $KWENTA Launch Competition WinnersKWENTA Launch Competition Winners SheetBlog: Your Guide to Rewards on KwentaDune: @shogun / Perpetual DEXs Insights (GMX, Perp, Kwenta, GNS)Kwenta State LogKwenta KIPs RepositoryKIP-16: OP Token Phase 0 ProposalKIP-29: Establish $OP Incentive ProgramKIP-61: Perps V2 Trading IncentivesSynthetix SIP-2003: Perps V2 Trading IncentivesIncentive Impact Analysis: RubiconIncentive Impact Analysis: SynthetixIncentive Impact Analysis: PolynomialMessari: State of Synthetix Q2 2023","Kwenta, a derivatives trading platform, received 900K OP from Optimism's Governance Fund.  Their initial distribution plan significantly diverged from the actual implementation due to unforeseen technical issues, a recurring problem among funded protocols. This analysis examines Kwenta's incentive program, revealing a 22% surge in trading volume on the day before reward distribution, suggesting potential for manipulation.  The authors recommend establishing a process for approving distribution changes, requiring implementation plans upfront, and employing less predictable reward schedules to mitigate gaming.  While the program boosted daily transactions and addresses, its long-term sustainability remains uncertain, highlighting the need for more innovative and experimental incentive designs in future Optimism grants.

‚ú® General,Optimism Chain NFT,https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-chain-nft/9370,"1.Define the Purpose of the Optimism Chain NFTCore Message: The central idea of the Optimism Chain NFT should focus on spreading optimism, positivity, and growth. NFTs could symbolize shared achievements, progress, or support for one another‚Äôs growth.Community Impact: The goal would be to create a digital movement that not only focuses on artistic value but also inspires optimism and collective support. Each NFT could represent a milestone in personal or group development, creating a chain of progress.2.Design the NFT CollectionVisual Design:The design should reflect optimism through vibrant colors, uplifting themes, and positive symbols (e.g., sunshine, stars, upward arrows, abstract representations of growth, etc.).Artworks could feature abstract designs, inspirational quotes, or even digital representations of actions that promote well-being (like a helping hand, a smile, or a tree growing).Consider creating a series where each NFT represents a different aspect of optimism (e.g., hope, gratitude, resilience, success).Tiered Collection: The NFTs could be designed with tiers that represent different stages of personal growth or collective success. For example, starting with‚ÄúOptimism Seeds‚Äù(beginner NFTs) and progressing to‚ÄúOptimism Trees‚Äù(more advanced or rare NFTs) as users progress in their optimism journey.3.Chain Concept & NFTs as MilestonesOptimism Chain: Each NFT could be a part of a larger ‚Äúchain‚Äù where holders are encouraged to share positive actions, stories, or contributions to the community.Milestone Rewards: As a holder accumulates more NFTs or participates in positivity-boosting activities, they earn rewards (such as special NFTs, real-life incentives, or access to exclusive content).Positive Actions Reward: Holders could be incentivized to participate in real-world actions or digital tasks that foster optimism (like community service, promoting mental wellness, or creating positive content).4.Smart Contracts & MechanismsDynamic NFTs: Create NFTs that evolve over time. For example, as holders engage in positive activities or share uplifting messages within a community, the NFT could change or upgrade to represent their contribution to the Optimism Chain.Governance & Collaboration: The NFTs could allow holders to vote on future projects or initiatives, creating a sense of ownership and collaboration. This could help the chain grow organically with input from the community.5.Incorporate Charity & Social GoodGive Back: A portion of profits from NFT sales could be donated to mental health initiatives, charities promoting positivity, or other causes aligned with the mission of optimism and well-being.Community Challenges: Use NFTs to encourage community-driven challenges focused on spreading positivity. For example, for every NFT sold, a tree could be planted or a specific amount donated to a mental health organization.6.Partnerships & CollaborationsCollaborate with Influencers or Mental Health Advocates: Partner with well-known figures in the mental health or motivational spaces to increase awareness of the Optimism Chain NFT project.Co-Create with Artists and Developers: Work with artists, creators, and developers who align with the vision of promoting optimism. Their involvement can bring diverse perspectives to the project and attract wider audiences.7.Community EngagementInteractive Features: The community could vote on what the next NFT in the Optimism Chain looks like or the types of positive actions it should reward. This keeps the community involved and invested in the project‚Äôs mission.Social Media Integration: Integrate the project into social media platforms, where holders share their Optimism NFTs and how they‚Äôve participated in positive actions. This can create a viral spread of optimism.Optimism Ambassadors: Designate certain community members as Optimism Ambassadors who represent the values of the NFT collection and spread its message through social platforms or real-life initiatives.8.Scarcity & ExclusivityLimited Editions: Create limited edition NFTs to keep their value high, while also incentivizing users to share their optimism and contribute meaningfully to the community.Exclusive Access: Holders of special editions could gain access to exclusive content or events (online workshops on positivity, mindfulness sessions, etc.).9.Sustainability of the ProjectLong-Term Vision: The Optimism Chain NFT should be more than just a trend‚Äîit should aim to create lasting change. Design the project with sustainability in mind, ensuring that as more people get involved, the chain grows and has a meaningful, ongoing impact on the community.Collaborative Milestones: The ultimate goal could be to reach a collective milestone where the entire Optimism Chain NFT community participates in a large-scale project for social good, like building a community center or supporting mental health initiatives.10.Technology and PlatformsChoose the Right Blockchain: Select a blockchain that supports eco-friendly practices, such as Ethereum 2.0 or other low-energy blockchains. This can help make the project more sustainable, aligning with the values of promoting a better world.Marketplace Integration: List the NFTs on popular marketplaces like OpenSea, Foundation, or Rarible to reach a wide audience. You could also create a dedicated platform for the Optimism Chain NFT collection to facilitate direct engagement and sales.Example Concept:‚ÄúThe Optimism Chain‚Äù NFTscould start with a small number of‚ÄúOptimism Seeds‚Äù(small, affordable NFTs) which users can collect. Each seed represents an action like a kind word, a positive post, or a small charitable act. As more seeds are collected and positive actions are shared, the seeds could grow into‚ÄúOptimism Blossoms‚Äùand eventually into‚ÄúOptimism Trees‚Äù, which could be rare, valuable NFTs symbolizing collective progress and impact.By creating a meaningful connection between digital assets and real-world positivity, theOptimism Chain NFTcould spread optimism across both the blockchain community and society at large.","The Optimism Chain NFT project aims to foster a positive digital movement.  NFTs, visually representing optimism through vibrant designs and tiered levels (Seeds, Blossoms, Trees), incentivize users to perform real-world positive actions, earning rewards and contributing to a growing chain of progress.  Community engagement is key, with collaborative governance, charity partnerships, and influencer collaborations driving growth.  Sustainable blockchain technology and strategic marketplace integration ensure long-term impact, culminating in large-scale social good initiatives.  The project leverages dynamic NFTs, evolving based on user contributions, creating a virtuous cycle of positivity and community building.

‚ú® General,OP Labs Audit Framework: When to get external security review and how to prepare for it,https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-labs-audit-framework-when-to-get-external-security-review-and-how-to-prepare-for-it/6864,"Hi all, maurelian from OP Labs here.  In this post, we are sharing an internally developed framework for identifying code which we believe should be audited prior to production deployment.Our purposes for publishing this framework are twofold:Providing an example which other contributors to the OP Stack may take into account when deciding how to get audits.Seeking feedback from the community.  Since Optimism Governance is the ultimate decider of what gets shipped to production, it‚Äôs important to ensure that the efforts made by core contributors like ourselves align with community expectations.The FrameworkThis framework provides guidance to teams at OP Labs who are writing security critical code for the OP Stack and are interested in obtaining external review, including:A security review or audit from a security firm.A community audit competition from a platform such as Sherlock.A bug bountyIt will describe what code should, from our perspective, be audited, and how to prepare for an audit.Philosophy Behind External Security AuditsIt is important to underscore that security starts with the developers. An audit should not be seen as a means of ‚Äúpurchasing a security guarantee‚Äù from an external vendor.What a security vendor provides is:Feedback and insight into your ability to write secure code.A final assurance about the specific code you have developed.A public artifact attesting to the security of the system.What code should be audited?Audits are expensive and time consuming, so we recommend using them in a targeted manner.Generally, audits are better suited for some kinds of codebases, specifically those whereSafetyis ofExistentialimportance.The following rubric divides projects along Liveness vs. Safety and Reputational vs. Existential axes.audit-rubric2282√ó1940 303 KBThe rubric above is not exhaustive, but should give a sense of the framework OP Labs uses to determine what requires an audit.Most OP Stack code fits into one of the following buckets:Secure via testing and real world usage:This applies largely to infrastructural code, referring to components such as op-node, op-geth, op-batcher as well as alternative implementations of such components.In general, audits are less valuable or necessary for infrastructural code because:Experience has shown us that auditors provide less value with infrastructural code, especially relative to what is learned by getting code running on a testnet or putting code in users‚Äô hands.When issues do occur in infrastructural code, they can be addressed through ‚Äòsocial consensus‚Äô, ie. quickly disseminating new software with a bug fix.Secure with extreme caution (including auditing):This applies largely to smart contract code, in particular in cases where assets are being secured.Examples include modifications to bridge code, changes to deposit derivation code, multi-sig wallet modifications, etc.In general, audits are necessary for smart contract code because damage resulting for vulnerabilities is more likely to be irrecoverable.There are likely to be situations where smart contract code does not require an audit, and where infrastructure code should receive an audit.Everycase requires a fact-specific analysis about whether an audit should be required.And while there is no ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù that works in all cases, analysis according to the Existential vs. Reputational x Liveness vs. Safety framework is more important than simply differentiating between infrastructure and smart contract code.Preparation for external security reviewOnce again, secure code starts with the development teams that write it. We recommend completing the following steps for a given codebase prior to seeking external review.Enumerate the invariants and security properties of the systemThis step can be completed however the development team wishes, though teams should note that it is an important input to the next two items.Documentation for security researchersSecurity specific docs which describe the high-level security properties of the system. A good example of this documentation is what OP Labsprovided to the Sherlock auditorsfor the Bedrock audit.Documentation for security researchers should outline:The behavior that the system is expected to maintain.The negative situations the system should prevent.Known issues which are considered low risk and are out of scope.Test coverage assessmentDevelopers should evaluate coverage of the system from two angles:Code coverageFor each testing method, a test coverage report should be generated. This report should be reviewed to identify any gaps in coverage.We should aim for greater than 100% coverage of critical code paths. We do not need to be sticklers about testing trivial code paths like basic getters and such.Property coverageFor each security property, a qualitative assessment of the test coverage should be done. It should answer the following questions:Has this property been thoroughly tested?Which testing methods have been used to test this property? Are there other testing methods we could apply with a reasonable amount of effort?Are there any edge cases relevant to this property which are not fully tested?Page 13 and onwards of thisTrail of Bits reportmay serve as a useful template for this assessment.ConclusionWe believe that this framework provides a strong foundation for both development teams and governance in evaluating the necessity of an external review OP Stack code.","OP Labs presents an internal framework for determining which OP Stack code requires security audits before production deployment.  Prioritizing audits based on a ""Safety vs. Liveness"" and ""Existential vs. Reputational"" rubric, the framework emphasizes that secure code begins with developers.  While smart contract code generally necessitates audits due to the irrecoverable nature of potential damage, infrastructural code often benefits more from testing and real-world usage.  The framework guides teams through pre-audit preparation, including documenting security properties and assessing test coverage, aiming for comprehensive testing of critical code paths.  This framework aims to align development efforts with community expectations and optimize the use of costly audits.

‚ú® General,Introducing Octant,https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-octant/9361,"Hey everyone! On behalf of Golem Foundation, we‚Äôd love to introduce Octant and explore positive-sum synergies with the Optimism Collective.Introducing OctantOctant, part ofGolem Foundation, is a project that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We‚Äôve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (~$390M as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.Over the past year, we‚Äôve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl,and many others.Need for SustainabilityOur experience has shown that most impactful, open-source projects / initiatives lack sustainability, often relying on one-time (grant) allocations without a sustainable flywheel.We aim on solving this by:Creating a provably fair, open, and minimally biased funding mechanismLeveraging substantial treasury resources and funding streams for maximum impact, powered by the Web3 ecosystems native value generating streamsFostering a sustainable ecosystem for open-source, real-world impactful projects developmentRewarding users for participation in the sustainable impact funding ecosystemCoordinating with other web3 ecosystem on funding specific deliverables/initiativesBy staking 100,000 ETH and donating the yield, we‚Äôre not just talking about change ‚Äî we‚Äôve actively started driving it. Our goal is to contribute to a better, more accessible, fair, and open world by making funding impactful projects truly sustainable.Alignment with Optimism CollectiveWe deeply resonate with Optimism‚Äôs vision of secure, equitable, and fair internet built on the Superchain ‚Äî with sustainable impact funding at its core (impact = profit).The Optimism Collective has pioneeredRetro Fundingand shown incredible work withSuperchain adoption, with each chain pledging % of their revenue to contribute to an even more sustainable Retroactive Funding flywheel. This is a perfect alignment with Octant‚Äôs vision of creating a sustainable funding model that actively supports public goods and the long-term health of impactful ecosystems at scale.Superchain directly aligns with Octant‚Äôs goal of building a cohesive, sustainable ecosystem for public goods funding that spans across multiple projects and networks ‚Äî and we believe that through collaboration with the Optimism Collective, we could co-facilitate more cross-chain coordination and cooperation to fund critical initiatives across the broader Ethereum ecosystem and beyond.We see Optimism as a key partner in advancing this mission, bringing together both technical infrastructure and community governance to create a positive-sum ecosystem that benefits Superchain and extends its impact. We‚Äôre excited to explore how our combined efforts can accelerate the shift toward a truly sustainable onchain future.Octant V2 VisionThe DeFi space has largely been disconnected from regenerative models (ReFi) and use cases such as impact investing and public goods funding. We need to bridge this gap and align incentives in a way that benefits both individual users and impactful projects.Octant v21409√ó933 242 KBThe image above illustrates Octant V2 flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.Dragon1370√ó881 294 KBThe diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon (project with substantial principal capital) engaging with the system. The protocol allows individual Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects across the broader Ethereum ecosystem.The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault distribution is decided by the Dragon and can be divided between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.The community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.Opportunities and CollaborationWe‚Äôre openly inviting the Optimism Collective to share your feedback and suggestions on this intro forum post. We see this as the beginning of our long-term, positive-sum collaboration that will directly benefit both Optimism Superchain ecosystem and the larger open internet.With that said, here‚Äôre some collaboration opportunities:Community ActivationsEcosystem initiatives across the SuperchainSustainable Impact FundingAllocating a % of the Optimism treasury to generate yield in the Protocol, and streaming a portion of those rewards to the Sustainability PoolIntegrations with the Optimism CollectiveMeaningful integrations possibilities with Superchain buildersGovernance ContributionEngage in shaping the future of Impact Funding via collaborative governance.It‚Äôs time for sustainable evolutionOur industry desperately needs bold experiments in sustainable funding for what truly matters. While experimental approaches may not always succeed, our efforts since Octant launched in summer ‚Äò23 have already shown tangible results and meaningful impact.We believe that co-creating and nurturing impact funding flywheel will lead to the evolution of how impactful projects and initiatives are funded, laying the groundwork for a sustainable future across the entire ecosystem.We look forward to hearing your feedback. Thank you!","Octant, a Golem Foundation project, fosters sustainable impact funding within the Ethereum ecosystem.  Using 100,000 ETH (~$390M), Octant distributes yield to hundreds of open-source projects, addressing the common lack of sustainable funding for impactful initiatives.  Octant aims to create a fair, open funding mechanism, leveraging Web3's value streams and rewarding user participation.  Seeking collaboration with the Optimism Collective, Octant envisions a positive-sum partnership, aligning their sustainable funding model with Optimism's Superchain vision.  This collaboration would involve community activations, treasury allocation, and governance contributions, ultimately creating a more sustainable future for impactful projects.

Specific security considerations are detailed in the Holocene derivation specification.Implementation PlanIf approved, the Holocene upgrade is scheduled for execution on January 9, 2025, at 18:00:01 UTC. The upgrade will occur automatically for chains on the Granite mainnet release that have opted in via their superchain-registry configuration.This upgrade represents a significant step forward in enhancing the Optimism network‚Äôs robustness and adaptability.Grants Council Season 6 EndsSeason 6 of the Grants Council has concluded, marking significant progress across its intents with a total allocation of over 16.3M OP tokens. The Council approved 122 grants out of 344 applications, showcasing a rigorous and inclusive selection process.AchievementsIntent#1:Supported governance and decentralization with tools like cross-chain voting, allocating ~290k OP tokens, with 90% locked for one year. Expected to increase votable supply by 5% in the next 12 months.Intent#3A:Funded 122 projects to grow developer activity on the OP Mainnet, aiming for 150 new active developers, supported by 4M OP tokens.Intent#3B:Empowered 15+ OP Chain grant programs with nearly 12M OP tokens, fostering tailored ecosystem growth.Learnings and ImprovementsChallenges included tight timelines, narrowly scoped mission requests, and limited developer awareness. Proposed solutions for Season 7 include a task force for earlier preparation, broader grant scopes, reallocation of inactive funds, and targeted outreach to developers.The season underscored Optimism‚Äôs commitment to decentralization, innovation, and ecosystem diversity, laying a robust foundation for continued progress.Committee RetrospectivesWith the conclusion of the Grants Council Season 6, multiple committees and councils involved in the process have shared their Retrospective thoughts on the Fourm, we have listed these hereCode of Conduct CouncilThe Code of Conduct Council‚Äôs Season 6 retrospective reports:Response Time:Adhered to a maximum of 5 business days for case resolution, with quicker responses for severe violations.Conflict Resolution:Out of 4 reports, 3 were de-escalated without enforcement actions, 1 required enforcement, and 1 was referred to mediation.Community Engagement:Conducted 4 public office hours and regular meetings to maintain transparency and accessibility.Operational Updates:Revised the council charter to clarify sanction boundaries and scopes.Overall, the council effectively managed conflicts, maintained community engagement, and upheld the Rules of Engagement.AntiCapture CommissionThe Anticapture Commission (ACC) fulfilled its Season 6 mandate by voting on all proposals subject to a Citizens‚Äô House veto, utilizing its 10M OP delegation. No instances of governance capture were identified. The votable supply increased by 18.5%, from 89.4M to 106M OP. The ACC also advocated for decentralization by suggesting additional voting interfaces beyond Agora. Challenges included technical concerns during the Granite Network Upgrade and issues with the Agora voting portal, both addressed through community discussions and recommendations. Future solutions involve the ACC evaluating decentralization progress and assisting in Phase II and III of the Accelerating Decentralization Proposal.Developer Advisor Board (DAB)The Developer Advisory Board (DAB) matured significantly in Season 6, evolving into a structured entity with established processes that positively impacted the Optimism Collective. Key achievements include:Protocol Upgrade Summaries:Provided non-technical summaries for all protocol upgrades within 72 hours, enhancing community understanding.Grants Council Support:Evaluated 179 Mission Request applications, earning a perfect Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 10/10 from the Grants Council.Community Engagement:Hosted calls to gather feedback and explore additional support avenues, with plans to expand impact in future seasons.Challenges involved logistical coordination and identifying areas for greater contribution. Proposed solutions include closer collaboration with OP Labs to align with the technical roadmap and proactively identify opportunities for involvement. The DAB aims to assume greater responsibilities in Season 7, such as assessing audit requests and selecting teams for Foundation Mission Requests.Security CouncilThe Security Council (SC) achieved key milestones in Season 6, including the successful election of Cohort A and consistent quorum attainment for protocol upgrade signings. These efforts advanced both technical and governance decentralization within the Optimism Collective. Challenges such as reliance on OP Labs for support and operational inefficiencies in compensation processing were identified. Proposed solutions include granting the SC budget autonomy and enhancing technical resources to bolster independence. As the Superchain governance framework evolves, the SC‚Äôs mandate should adapt to manage expanded responsibilities, including Blockspace Charters and the Superchain Registry.Community OverviewMain Account:714K Followers (+14K)Governance X Account: 30.2K Followers (+200)Discord: 162K Members (~ -1000)Community TrendsContinuous Upgrades:Core contributors and developer teams including OP labs are continously shipping upgrades to the OP Network, ensuring security, relevance and efficiency of the OP network remains progressing.Standardisation of processesThe OP collective has evolved as a prime example of a self governing community. Moreover with time, most of the processes are standardised which ensure a basic minimum performance expectation within the collective at the same time making sure that malicious hijacking of the activities is not a straightforward process. Notable is the Grants council and all the commissions related to the smooth functioning of the Grants council.Experimentation with GrantsOver the time with multiple formats of Grants running concurrently including retroPGF and grants councils, the community is getting better with time in distributing and allocating incentives in a fair fashion. No process is perfect and there are still learnings along the way, but the transparent nature of the Collective ensures that any critical feedback can be easily implemented.Closing StatementNovember 2024 was a pivotal month for the Optimism Collective, characterized by forward momentum in governance, innovation, and community engagement. While no on-chain proposals were submitted, preparations for Special Voting Cycle#31ademonstrate an active governance pipeline. Key updates such as the Holocene Network Upgrade proposal and the conclusion of Grants Council Season 6 highlight the Collective‚Äôs commitment to decentralization, security, and ecosystem growth.Committee retrospectives showcased the evolving maturity of governance structures, with significant achievements across various councils and commissions. These reflections not only provide transparency but also pave the way for meaningful improvements in future seasons.Community metrics and trends further underscore the sustained growth and adaptability of the Optimism ecosystem. With continued experimentation, standardization, and innovation, the Collective solidifies its role as a model for decentralized governance.As we transition into December, the stage is set for impactful governance initiatives, advancing Optimism‚Äôs mission of scaling Ethereum sustainably and equitably.","Optimism's November 2024 governance update highlights the upcoming Holocene Network Upgrade (January 2025), enhancing security and performance.  Grants Council Season 6 concluded, distributing 16.3M OP tokens across 122 grants, fostering developer growth and ecosystem diversity.

‚ú® General,"Contributionism - An economic model for organisations, an alternative to capitalism",https://gov.optimism.io/t/contributionism-an-economic-model-for-organisations-an-alternative-to-capitalism/9325,"contributionism-header1920√ó1080 158 KBContributionismis an economic model built around contribution.Contributionism focuses on the organisation and how they are owned, governed and incentivised.Contributionism represents an alternative to capitalism.Critiques of capitalismCapitalism is one of the most widely adopted models for structuring organisations across the world.Capitalism is often associated with a number of economic structures and ideas such as free markets, business, private property, profit motives and wealth accumulation amongst others.Capitalism is not required for any of these structures or ideas. They could exist and be broadly adopted in other economies that adopt different approaches for structuring the organisation.Capitalism is focussed on the organisation. Capitalism adopts a share based ownership structure that influences how organisations are owned, governed and incentivised.A number of critiques can be made about how capitalism structures organisations:Flawed justifications for unfair contribution treatment- Earlier contributions are excessively rewarded at the expense of future contributions. Commonly used reasons to justify this excessive reward are not fairly justified.Contributions are not respected- Contributions do not need to be respected under capitalism. The common purpose of a capitalist organisation is to maximise shareholder value. Capitalism often leads to a disconnect between contributions and ownership, governance and incentives.Flawed share governance and incentive rights- Perpetual governance and incentive rights are a flawed approach that is commonly adopted with shares of ownership. This structure commonly leads to excessive compensation for earlier contributions at the expense of future contributions.Fair compensation often requires ongoing gestures of goodwill- Maximising shareholder value can lead to environments where labour is exploited. Workers are often constantly reliant on the goodwill gestures of owners to not exploit their contributions.Risk of stagnant ownership and leadership that isn‚Äôt collectively accepted- Capitalism can result in stagnant ownership and leadership. Leadership might not be collectively accepted by the contributors involved in the organisation.Risk of motive, priority and incentive misalignment- The motives, priorities and incentives of capitalist owners and leadership can become increasingly misaligned with workers.Excessive competition- Capitalism incentivises excessive amounts of competition due to the perpetual need for workers to create their own organisations if they want to be fairly rewarded for their contributions.Equal opportunity and meritocratic fallacies- Capitalism does not commonly result in meritocratic organisations. Capitalism does not create economies that have equal opportunity.Capitalism is often rightly criticised for serving the interests of the few and for increasing the amount of inequality across society.When you review how ownership, governance and incentives are handled under capitalism, you can more easily see how a capitalist structure can lead to these undesirable outcomes.Capitalism was never properly designed to fairly reward and respect all of the contributions that people make towards an organisation.Instead, capitalism creates a structure that incentivises the exploitation of future contributions and creates an environment where this exploitation can more easily occur.Contributionism, an alternative approachContributionism looks to resolve the issues that are commonly found in capitalist organisations.A number of contributions are important to an organisation. These contributions include labour, capital, consumption or donations.The economic model for contributionism includes 7 key principles that organisations should follow to improve how they are owned, governed and incentivised.The 7 principles of contributionism include:Respect contribution- All contributions should be respected.Contributor & public ownership- Organisations should be contributor owned or publicly owned.Contributor governed- All organisations are contributor governed.Temporary governance rights- Temporary governance rights should be given to all contributions that match the contribution ownership type.Temporary incentives rights- Contributions should receive temporary incentive rights so that contributors can benefit from the full value of their contributions.Transparent priorities- Priorities should be transparent so that people can contribute towards organisations that they are aligned with.Collectively accepted leadership- Leadership should be collectively accepted.There is a massive opportunity to create organisations with better aligned incentives that fairly respect and reward all contributions that get made towards an organisation.To properly respect contribution in any organisation, we‚Äôll need to collectively keep getting better at understanding and rewarding contribution.Contributionism is only interested in broadly defining the most important principles that organisations should follow.Beyond these initial principles, it is up to the contributors involved in an organisation to decide how they want to operate.Each organisation could be operated in a large variety of ways. The purpose of contributionism is to suggest the structures for ownership, governance and incentives that should lead to positive outcomes for all the contributors involved in the organisation.Contributors should feel confident that if they maximise their contribution efforts to generate value and impact that their contributions will be respected and fairly rewarded.Contributions are the foundation of any economy. Contributionism helps to ensure that contributions are the beating heart of every organisation.Why is this relevant for OptimismContributionism could represent one of the go to models for thinking about how organisations and DAO‚Äôs structure themselves in Web3.Contributionism is solely focussed on how organisations handle ownership, governance and incentives.The ideas suggested in contributionism should become increasingly relevant for the growing number of organisations that are being started across the Web3 industry.This economic model was started by outlining some of the fundamental principles that can be recommended to organisations to consider and adopt.We‚Äôre looking to gather feedback to refine and improve upon the current foundations with further analysis and resources.After that we‚Äôll explore approaches that could be adopted under this model and look at what tools and systems could be developed and used to experiment with this model across Web3 ecosystems and potentially elsewhere.Next steps for contributionismContributionism is being shared widely to everyone that might be interested in giving their thoughts and feedback about the model.If you know of any existing efforts that might be related and relevant to this initiative then please do share them in the comments.Right now our focus is just to raise awareness about these ideas and listen to any feedback that people might have!You can find our Twitter and Telegram on thecontributionismwebsite if you wanted to reach out and discuss anything directly.","Contributionism is a proposed economic model offering an alternative to capitalism.  Critiquing capitalism's flawed reward systems, exploitative practices, and misaligned incentives, contributionism prioritizes respect for all contributions (labor, capital, etc.).  Its seven principles advocate for contributor or public ownership, contributor governance, temporary governance and incentive rights, transparent priorities, and collectively accepted leadership.  Unlike capitalism, it aims to fairly reward all contributions, fostering better-aligned organizational structures, particularly relevant for Web3 DAOs.  The model is currently seeking feedback and collaboration to refine its principles and explore practical applications.

They are NFTs that control a vesting amount of OP, with the additional feature that the owners of these GovNFTs can delegate the vesting OPbeforeit is actually vested!This process has been managed manually by the foundation to date. In the future, it may make sense to distribute grants and/or retrofunding rewards using GovNFTs.The GovNFT program was specifically designed to test-drive this new primitive. Its goals were twofold:Showcase and test the GovNFT technology developed by VelodromeCreate a new type of incentive program to bring high-quality contributions to Optimism GovernanceOverall, the program was a great success! Here are some highlights:146 GovNFTs chose a delegate212,440 OP was delegated from those GovNFTs20+ GovNFT recipients posted their reasoning on why they chose a specific delegate (see end of post for examples)100+ responses on threads discussing upgrades, RetroFunding, community call discussions, and other Optimism Governance topicsIncreased attendance to community callsThat said, there were some challenges. While we received many high-quality responses, there were instances of low-quality participation, such as copying and pasting passages from the Optimism docs instead of contributing meaningfully to the discussion. We addressed this by manually verifying the quality of the responses.Additionally, although we had a decent level of participation, the majority of distributed GovNFTs were not delegated. This may be due to communication silos. These GovNFTs were distributed based on on-chain usage of Velodrome, but users who didn‚Äôt actively follow the Velodrome team‚Äôs account on X or check Discord announcements may not have been aware of the program.As many of you know, increasing valuable participation in governance is challenging! I‚Äôd rate this program as having moderate success, along with many learnings for future efforts.On-chain stats for the GovNFTs from this program can be tracked on the publicDune dashboard.Example delegation reasonings:Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 9.11.07 AM1404√ó434 46.1 KBScreenshot 2024-11-05 at 9.10.16 AM1350√ó380 58.5 KBScreenshot 2024-11-05 at 9.10.02 AM1360√ó212 17.9 KBScreenshot 2024-11-05 at 9.10.39 AM1378√ó232 21.9 KBThanks again to everyone who participated, and I am looking forward to seeing where we can take the open source GovNFTs in the future.- Michael",Summary not available

This supports its shift toward decentralized governance, minimizing the need for manual actions by the Optimism Foundation.Technical ImplementationA timelock contract with a 3-day delay will secure treasury transactions. This will ensure automated on-chain execution for treasury actions while keeping non-treasury proposals under manual Foundation control.ImpactThis move boosts operational efficiency and transparency, aligning with Optimism‚Äôs self-governing goals by implementing secure, automated treasury management.Grants Council Season 6IntroductionThe Season 6 of Grants council was approved by a series of on-chain proposals in May and June with a total budget of more than 18M OP tokens. The Grants council began accepting applications mid-July and recently closed applications for its Cycle 29. Its final cycle, the Cycle 30 will begin accepting applications early November.WorkingsThe Grant scopes are divided into 3 broad categoriesIntent#1:Progress towards DecentralizationIntent # 3A: Focuses on expanding the application developer ecosystem on the Optimism mainnet.Intent # 3B: Grant for OP Chains to establish and run their own grant programs.ImpactThe impact of the Grants Council in Season 6 is multifaceted, aiming to solidify Optimism‚Äôs ecosystem by advancing decentralization, expanding developer resources, and supporting diverse Superchain ecosystems. Through Intent 1, it enhances governance and technical resilience, creating tools like cross-chain voting and capture assessment frameworks, thus bolstering the DAO‚Äôs autonomy and security.Intent 3A‚Äôs focus on developer growth on OP Mainnet drives innovation with specific grants for application development, educational resources, and tools that simplify entry for new builders. This effort aims to reach a target of 9,500 active developers, directly increasing protocol adoption and ecosystem stickiness through unique projects like gaming and AI applications.Lastly, Intent 3B‚Äôs allocation to Superchain members empowers individual OP Chains to tailor grants to their community‚Äôs needs, promoting ecosystem diversity. This decentralization of funding aligns with Optimism‚Äôs goal of a robust Superchain, making developer resources and grants accessible across multiple OP Chains.Together, these initiatives are expected to drive sustained developer engagement, improve protocol-level governance, and reinforce Optimism‚Äôs position as a decentralized, developer-centric platform.Retro Funding 5 and 6IntroductionRetro Funding Rounds 5 and 6 by the Optimism Collective are part of its Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) initiative, aimed at rewarding past contributions that benefit the ecosystem. Retro Funding 5, launched in mid-2024, focused on contributors to the OP Stack, supporting advancements in infrastructure and tooling essential for scaling Ethereum. Retro Funding 6, launched later in 2024, is centered on governance contributions, and funding efforts that improve governance infrastructure, analytics, and leadership within Optimism. RetroFunding 5 has awarded results, RetroFunding 6 is still in progress.WorkingsThe RetroPGF process involves the Citizens‚Äô House, with members voting on projects‚Äô impact. Round 5 experimented with expert voters for allocation, aiming to introduce fairness and reduce potential biases in assessing OP Stack contributions. In Round 6, the focus shifted to governance, incorporating guest voters to assess governance-focused projects and introducing a Farcaster-based application process for transparency. Each project applies under a specific category to streamline the funding assessment process, with each voting phase addressing distribution fairness and alignment with Optimism‚Äôs goals.ImpactThe Retro Funding process has expanded Optimism‚Äôs ecosystem by funding foundational infrastructure in Round 5, fostering broader tooling and protocol development. This approach enhances Optimism‚Äôs scalability and accessibility for developers. Round 6 is expected to improve governance engagement and accountability, with projects supporting the evolution of a decentralized and transparent governance model for Optimism. The use of expert and guest voters has not only diversified input but also set a precedent for inclusive and impact-driven funding across Optimism‚Äôs collective initiatives.Community OverviewMain Account:704K FollowersGovernance X Account: 30K FollowersDiscord: 163K MembersCommunity TrendsDecentralization Commitment: Optimism‚Äôs community-led governance, including the Citizens‚Äô House, ensures that the ecosystem remains decentralized and empowers members with a real stake in decision-making.Strong Public Goods Culture: Through RetroPGF, Optimism actively rewards contributions that align with public goods funding, attracting projects that build essential infrastructure and tools for the ecosystem.Feedback and Improvement Culture:No process is perfect, the OP collective and its members come together to discuss various processes, their shortcomings and potential improvements in a vibrant manner.Enhanced Governance Diversity: There‚Äôs potential to further diversify participation within governance to bring fresh perspectives and broader representation.Cross-Chain Collaborations: As the Superchain grows, Optimism can forge more partnerships with other chains and projects, bringing more innovation and utility into its ecosystemClosing SummaryOctober 2024 marked significant strides for Optimism, highlighting its growing autonomy and ecosystem expansion. The successful adoption of on-chain treasury execution underscores Optimism‚Äôs dedication to decentralization, reducing reliance on centralized operations. With Grants Council Season 6 nearly complete and the final funding cycle underway, Optimism continues to foster a vibrant developer ecosystem, advancing both core applications and Superchain development.RetroFunding Rounds 5 and 6 further underscore Optimism‚Äôs unique approach to rewarding impactful contributions, supporting essential infrastructure through public goods funding and enhancing governance capabilities. Community engagement remains robust, with strengths in decentralization and collaborative culture, setting a solid foundation for future growth. Optimism‚Äôs ongoing commitment to transparency and community-driven improvement is evident in its governance processes, positioning the Collective for continued success and innovation across the Superchain.",Summary not available

‚ú® General,Suggestions on the Future Direction of Selling Blockchain Space Using NFT Transfer Functions:,https://gov.optimism.io/t/suggestions-on-the-future-direction-of-selling-blockchain-space-using-nft-transfer-functions/9209,"Core Vision: Ownership transfers should be enabled through NFTs, facilitating the efficient trading of blockchain space.Long-Term Goal: To become the ‚ÄúAmazon of ownership transfers,‚Äù where users verify the authenticity and ownership of physical or virtual assets via NFTs before receiving them, ensuring transaction security. Additionally, by leveraging NFTs to support the trading of blockchain space, this approach enhances the utilization and fee revenue of public chains.Market Positioning: While Amazon focuses on physical ownership transfers, NFT technology plays a key role in virtual ownership transfers. Just as property transactions include both the property and deed, NFTs can secure the ownership transfer of digital assets like blockchain space, providing more application scenarios for public chains.Key Markets to Develop and Create Flagship Use Cases:High-Value Asset Ownership Transfers: For assets like real estate and vehicles, using NFTs to ensure safe transfers.Products Requiring Strong Brand and Anti-Counterfeit Verification: For products like Apple devices, where NFTs confirm authenticity and alleviate fears of counterfeits.Products with High Copyright Certification Needs: For items like anime merchandise or traditional Chinese crafts, NFTs can establish brand trust and prevent piracy.NFT-Based Sales of Blockchain Space: By selling public chain blockchain space as NFTs, ownership and usage rights can be transferred flexibly, increasing transaction volume and enhancing public chain fee revenue.Expansion Recommendations:Form dedicated teams to pursue partnerships in each sector, promoting the standardized development of NFT-based blockchain space sales for more efficient and flexible transactions.New Areas to Explore:Rental Rights: For example, in real estate leasing, where NFTs confirm rental rights, increasing transparency and trust in the rental market.By focusing on these core needs, enabling blockchain space trading through NFT transfer functions can significantly boost the value and fee revenue of public chains while strengthening their impact in the digital asset market.",Summary not available

‚ú® General,Optimism Delegation Frame on Farcaster - Now live!,https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-delegation-frame-on-farcaster-now-live/8808,"We have launched Optimism Delegation Frame on Farcaster. We wanted to create a simple way for anyone to check their OP delegation and re-delegate to active delegates. The goal is to make the delegation process straightforward and easy to understand.You can test out The Optimism Delegation Frame here:https://warpcast.com/tempetechie.eth/0xbebd9d04Below you can find a description of the frame functions and how they work.Check My DelegateThe first call to action is there to hook users into their first interaction with the frame. This one is crucial. We want to make many users aware of their OP holdings and their delegating options. Users here have only one option. Click the ‚ÄúCheck My Delegate‚Äù button. The result is the Info FrameInfo Frame and Share ButtonThis frame tells users their wallet address (the one they use on Farcaster), their OP balance, and who their Delegate is. It gives users two options to continue. One is to delegate their tokens to a new delegate; they need to know the delegate‚Äôs address, .eth name, or Farcaster username. The second option is to share their data in a new cast.Delegate to New DelegateIf the user decides to delegate there the next feature calls the Optimism delegation function. First, it tells users all the information about the delegate they pick (their wallet address, ENS, and Farcaster handle). This allows users to double-check if the information is correct. After that, they can click confirm. This function requires wallet confirmation.Success Frame and Share ButtonThis frame serves as a confirmation frame. Users can check the Tx Info or share the frame in the cast. The share frame function makes it super easy for other users to also confirm delegates (with just one click) to a new delegate that users picked.Next stepsCollect feedback and build on top of our first iteration of the frame.Feel free to share your feedback in the comments below.We are also open to connecting with other initiatives and programs within the Optimism Governance.About usIggy Social is a team of builders that creates tools in the web3 social space.

ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions,[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Balancer & BeethovenX,https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-balancer-beethovenx/2658,"Project Name:BeethovenX, powered by BalancerAuthor Name:Solarcurve (BalancerDAO contributor, BeethovenX advisor)Number of OP tokens requested:500,000L2 Recipient Address:0x2a185C8A3C63d7bFe63aD5d950244FFe9d0a4b60Relevant Usage Metrics:Balancer has ~$1.4B TVL and does ~$500M volume per week. This is the network OP incentives would be competing in through the veBAL gauge vote.Currently on OP we have ~$4.8M TVL, ~$500k daily volume, ~$3-4k daily fees,  ~2k daily tx‚Äôs.Balancer & BeethovenX have allocated $500k of incentives over 8 weeks towards Optimism so we could launch as soon as possible, which we did on June 2nd (https://op.beets.fi/). Optimism will soon be integrated into the veBAL gauge system and we will need to secure votes for Optimism pools to earn BAL emissions.Optimism alignmentBoth Balancer and BeethovenX view Optimism as one of the most promising scaling solutions - not only because of the world class technology but also the entire vision of the Optimism Collective. This has the potential to create a narrative beyond simply making money which is incredibly exciting. We view Optimism as the perfect foundation upon which to build the world‚Äôs most advanced decentralized exchange.BeethovenX, in collaboration with Balancer, will roll out cutting edge technology on Optimism such as Boosted Pools and Managed Pools. The goal is to build an unparalleled UX that puts the full power of Balancer technology in the hands of all Optimism users and projects.We are here for the long term. As you‚Äôll read below we have an innovative plan to create a positive flywheel that can continue to drive BAL emissions to Optimism through the veBAL gauges even after external incentives, like this proposal is requesting, are exhausted. BeethovenX is sacrificing half of their share of protocol revenues towards this flywheel precisely because of the belief that the long term benefits will be worth far more.Proposal for token distributionHow will the OP tokens be distributed?OP will likely be used to bribe in veBAL gauges for pools on Optimism, primarily boosted pools. Boosted pools are liquidity pools that only keep a small amount of tokens on hand for trading and send the rest to earn yield on Aave, Yearn, or similar platforms. Balancer was the first DEX to launch liquidity mining back in mid-2020 and many large holders of BAL are strong believers in the Ethereum (and Optimism) ethos. It is reasonable to expect many veBAL voters to hold onto the OP they stand to earn from bribes, and future improvements like adding L2 boosts will provide further incentive alignment.How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?Bribing is on average ~3x more cost effective (based on recent veBAL history) compared to traditional liquidity mining. With this strategy we can efficiently bootstrap AMM liquidity on Optimism AND lending markets like Aave simultaneously. However, if the ROI on bribing decreases to the point where it is a higher ROI to match OP 1:1 in traditional liquidity mining we retain the option to do that. In any case, OP will always be matched 1:1 in $ value.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?While we expect that boosted pools and future technology like managed pools will see strong interest even without external incentives, we also plan to pioneer methods of sustainable incentives that will persist after all OP incentives are exhausted. We will be directing 25% of the protocol fees earned on Optimism towards bribing for the pools that generated those fees (or as direct incentives on those pools). That means activity stimulated by external incentives would directly lead to higher bribes ‚Üí more veBAL votes ‚Üí more BAL emissions ‚Üí more TVL ‚Üí more trading activity, etc.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?We can‚Äôt place a timeframe on distribution as that is directly related to the fees generated by the protocol.How much will your project match in co-incentives?The agreement between BeethovenX and Balancer stipulated that the protocol fee of 50% would be split 50/50. BeethovenX will be directinghalf of their fee earnings towards matching OPincentives for the pools that generated those fees, either through bribes or direct liquidity mining. For example, if Balancer on Optimism generated $400k in protocol fees for this month then BeethovenX would be entitled to $200k. Half of that ($100k) would be matched with $100k of OP and allocated towards incentives on Optimism pools.Beyond this, BeethovenX has already allocated up to 3M BEETS for bribing for Optimism pools that we will use at our discretion. This isin additionto the match proposed above. These 3M BEETS will be used to kick start the flywheel described above through an early and aggressive bribing campaign.",Summary not available

Currently, we propose for a joint community multisig made of members from the OP Collective and ParaSwap, but if this idea is not viable, we can also simply make a ParaSwap DAO multisig.Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.):For general usage metrics, please see ourdashboard, but here are some key statistics:34 Billion in Volume processed (dollars), as of the time of writing, of which over the past 7 days~140 million processed through Ethereum~87 million processed through Alt-L1sDepending on the period, between 6 to 10 thousand unique users daily.While the dashboard does not provide daily tx (30 day average), a quick call shows that we process over 10k transactions a day most of the time.Our most relevant information can be found in our dashboard1600√ó487 129 KBOptimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):ParaSwap is looking to incentivize growth within the Optimism ecosystem byencouraging integrations and developments within this L2 using grants. Additionally, we wish to kickstart a healthy level of liquidity in Optimism, in an effort to move more of our DAO activities towards Optimism in the future. In summary, ParaSwap helps all forms of Optimism users:For the swappers on the Optimism network, ParaSwap automatically will find the best swap rates across all pools, giving them the best market price.For liquidity providers, ParaSwap directs more swaps to their pools. This is especially true for pools providing better rates and might not be well known.For app/dApp developers, a ParaSwap integration will allow seamless integrations for swapping assets, as well as a potential revenue stream should they choose to include afee (ParaSwap takes no flat fee)With enough liquidity provided, Optimism could become the main network for $PSP holders to interact in. This liquidity would also encourage future developments of the $PSP token to be deployed preferentially in Optimism over other networks. Fees from the liquidity will also increase revenue for all pool holders.Finally, any DEX can freely integrate with us using our open-sourced DexLib (see github for more information), a first in aggregators to allow for community integrations!Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):The main purpose of the OP distribution will be simple:To incentivise the development of tools that help access the liquidity depth of the Optimism ecosystem. We are requesting these funds before our deployment so developers have time to get acquainted with ParaSwap before our release, thus giving developers as much of a headstart as possible to begin thinking of forms to develop the Optimism ecosystem.How will the OP tokens be distributed?Currently, the following distribution vectors will be proposed:50% $OP will be distributed to new dApp and app developers that integrate ParaSwap into their swaps and interact directly with the Optimism ecosystem. If any particular type of dApp is preferred, we can work with the OP governance to further decide what kinds of apps receive a certain amount of the allocations.35% of $OP will be used to establish permanent, protocol-owned liquidity on Optimism. This would lead to no dumping of $OP onto the market compared to liquidity mining rewards.15% $OP will be distributed to successful DexLib integrations in the Optimism ecosystem. We will provide a flat reward for any integration, followed by a bonus depending on success metrics.How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?With these distributions, DEXes will be incentivized to be integrated into ParaSwap, giving them access to new users, and giving the whole protocol a more cohesive liquidity. This, combined with the developer grants , would greatly incentivize the on-boarding process onto Optimism.In terms of the ParaSwap DAO, having a healthy source of liquidity here will make Optimism a major hub for all future developments, and we would be more than looking forward to working with the OP CollectiveWhy will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?Once integrated into DexLib, these integrations are permanent and do not need to be renewed.Once the apps integrate ParaSwap and work with the Optimism ecosystem, they do not need further maintenance.Unlike liquidity mining, protocol-owned liquidity will mean that the liquidity will remain on the protocol, and no constant rewards will be needed to maintain it.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?As development takes time, we do not want to set a deadline for this claim period of $OP. Instead, we will wait and see the utilisation rate of the funds within the first couple months of deployment onto Optimism, and re-assess the distribution strategy from there. This is why, for now, we are making a conservative request of a Tier 3.How much will your project match in co-incentives?Assuming a proposal successfully passing for each of them on our DAOs:ParaSwap will reward DexLib integrations with PSP to further encourage integrations.ParaSwap will match the liquidity provided with $PSPIncentives for apps and dApps will have to be decided on an individual basis depending on the value brought.",Summary not available
ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions,[READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Beefy,https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-beefy/2967,"Beefy Incentive ProposalProject Name:BeefyAuthor Name:@frondotoNumber of OP tokens requested:650,000 OPL2 Recipient Address:0x4ABa01FB8E1f6BFE80c56Deb367f19F35Df0f4aEDeployed on Optimism:Yes, on 27/06Relevant Metrics:TVL: $268,000,000 across 16 different blockchainsTVL in Optimism $10,000,000 (Linkto DeFi llama for the latest number)Site:https://app.beefy.com/Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation)Beefy is the multi-chain yield optimizer known for its high security standards. Every protocol that gets listed on Beefy passes strict safety checks to ensure the platform where our users are depositing is safe. This frequently results in Beefy joining talks with these teams, helping them adjust their security measures, and most of the time partnering with the underlying protocol, making it known to our vast multi-chain audience.Beefy also has a multi-chain app. This means that the opportunities across 16 different chains can be compared side by side to choose the best place to put your tokens to work.Beefy‚Äôs users are quite diverse, but what they all have in common is that they have been priced out of Ethereum. Deploying Beefy on Optimism allows those users to enjoy the safety of Ethereum, without paying the high gas prices.We gathered feedback from different delegates and they required us to deploy on the chain and gain some traction, which we did. Currently Beefy has 23 different vaults auto-compounding more than $10,000,000 of TVL. We have vaults for BeethovenX, Velodrome, Stargate, Curve, just to name a few.At the time of writing this we are in talks with 4 different protocols on Optimism to partner with them and multiply even more the effect of the incentives. One example of this is Qidao, their protocol utilizes mooTokens (interest bearing collateral) to allow users to mint MAI and leverage their position. This will be possible since Chainlink is already deployed on the chain.Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words)How will the OP tokens be distributed? & How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?After deploying on the chain and working with its protocols we encountered impactful ways to get the incentives to work.35% of the OP tokens will be used to incentivize a BIFI-OP farm. Having this farm is vital to offer our complete product to Optimism users. Beefy distributes the earnings of the platform in the form of , and we have a BIFI Maxi vault which auto-compounds the ETH for BIFI daily. In order to offer that vault we need liquidity on that pair. To do this we are considering bribing veVELO holders, or doing co-incentives with BeethovenX. We will distribute these in between 12 and 18 months. After this rewards run out we will bring to the DAO the decision of continuing the rewards with Beefy Optimism treasury.Edited this bit to be the pair BIFI-OP as@OPUsersuggestion. Having BIFI on an LP is enough, we don‚Äôt need it to be ETH, and having OP instead makes a lot more sense. We are encouraging BIFI holders to research and learn about OP (which we will provide materials for), and provide liquidity. This will bring our communities much closer.50% of the incentives will be used to boost the farms of native Optimism protocols. The strategy will be to ‚Äúshowcase‚Äù Optimism protocols to our users through our social media (Twitter, Discord, and Telegram) and boost the vault containing its native token. This is great to put those protocols in the spotlight and bring new investors.Liquidity in Beefy is very sticky. Based on our vast experience doing these kinds of activities, after the boost finishes, more than 70% of the TVL stays in the vault, despite having others with better APY. TVL only moves if the difference is significant. This might be since Beefy is kind of a ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù platform since the only interactions you need to do with our contracts is to deposit and withdraw (No periodic claims, manually compound, etc). We expect to use these incentives in around 12 months, boosting approximately 7 Optimism protocols for 1,5 months each.15% strategist developer/team incentives. Building a Beefy vault is not a simple task.Every new vault has its unique challenges that the development team has to solve in order to offer our users the simple ‚ÄúEarn more of what you stake‚Äù, but in the back, there is a ton of work being done. We vaulted Stargate pools, bringing more liquidity to their bridge/tokens to the chain. We are also showcasing our brand new Velodrome vaults, making Beefy the first protocol to offer auto-compounding vaults for that protocol. We cannot wait for MakerDAO, Lido, and many other big names to deploy on Optimism so we can work with them to bring liquidity to their pairs. This means we will need to develop even more strategies to fit these protocols.These incentives will be used to reward new and existing collaborators that develop new strategies for Beefy Optimism. It is relevant to mention that our strategies are open for everyone to see and use, many times being a stepping stone for other protocols to build upon.All of the incentives will be distributed during long periods of time as described above.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?Incentives are an excellent way to welcome new users to try the chain, and stay for their unique products and ecosystem. We will use the incentives to create deep and meaningful partnerships with Optimism protocols, many of which we had great relations with from other chains. One blockchain CEO compared this kind of incentives to when Uber launched. Uber was giving free rides and discounts to a lot of users, and people stuck using Uber after those incentives run out. Those incentives were used to bring users to a superior ride-sharing service. We are aiming for the same strategy here. Make users come for the opportunities, and make them stay for the unique product ecosystem/community.Also at the same time that we distribute the incentives, we are planning education around Optimism, their technology, their unique structure of the governance of the chain, and also provide social events in which our multi-chain users can get to know Optimism protocols, and hopefully bring their liquidity/invest on them.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?Between 12 and 18 months. (Extended the period from last proposal)Also since Delegates raised the concern of tracking the correct spending of grants, we compromise to keep the delegates up to date with the spending/uses.How much will your project match in co-incentives?BIFI has a max supply of 80,000 which is fully distributed, and the DAO holds very little of the supply (less than 1%). That is the reason we can‚Äôt match in co-incentives.To summarize:Deployed on the chain, locked $3M TVL in 2 weeks.Re-structure of OP distribution.Added community-building activities to the proposal leveraging Beefy socials.Compromise to report the spending to the delegates in the Optimism Discord server.","Beefy, a multi-chain yield optimizer with $268M TVL (including $10M on Optimism), requests 650,000 OP tokens.  This proposal outlines a 12-18 month plan to incentivize BIFI-OP liquidity (35%), boost native Optimism protocol farms (50%), and reward developers (15%).  Beefy's strategy leverages its large, diverse user base,  attracted by Ethereum's security without high gas fees.  Post-incentive, user retention is expected due to strong partnerships, community building, and Beefy's user-friendly platform.  Transparency regarding token spending will be maintained via regular updates to Optimism delegates.  No co-incentives are possible due to BIFI's fully distributed supply.

ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions,[GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Synapse Protocol,https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-synapse-protocol/928,"Project Name:Synapse ProtocolAuthor Name:Max BronsteinDefilama TVL (at snapshot):$38.9MTransactions/day (at snapshot)23Tier:2Optimism Native:NoRevisions to metrics used:N/ANumber of OP tokens to claim:1,000,000L2 Recipient Address:0x2e07DA88586C442aDE6A442106A04eDc7378265dProposal for token distribution:BackgroundSynapse Protocol is a cross-chain communications network used to seamlessly interconnect all blockchains. The Synapse Protocol is comprised of a messaging framework and an economically secure method to reach consensus on the validity of cross-chain transactions which developers can leverage to build truly native cross-chain applications.The Synapse Bridge is the first user-facing product built on top of the protocol. Our bridge allows users to easily send a variety of assets across 16 EVM and non-EVM blockchains. In a short span of time, our bridge has become one of the most widely used and trusted bridges, processed over $10 billion in total volume, servicing hundreds of thousands of users as well as mass scale dapps like DeFi Kingdoms.Synapse launched support for bridging into and out of Optimism 6 months ago and we‚Äôre thrilled about the opportunity to continue supporting the ecosystem in its new phase.How will tokens be distributed?The Synapse Ecosystem has a few core constituents:DevelopersLiquidity ProvidersUsersToken HoldersSynapse‚Äôs proposed $OP distribution will benefit all of them.DevelopersAmount:150,000 $OPAs an extensible cross-chain communications network, fostering an ecosystem of developers who create cross-chain enabled applications is our top priority. Since Synapse connects Optimism with 15 different unique blockchain ecosystems, more applications/projects built on top of Synapse translates into more potential user pathways into Optimism.While we continue to build new open source developer tooling and release new documentation, we will also be launching a Grants program to encourage more community members to help build and grow the Synapse Protocol. As part of this grants program, we would use a portion of our $OP to fund any community tools or applications that help users on other chains connect with Optimism and more generally help existing Optimism projects better tap into cross-chain liquidity.Liquidity Providers & UsersAmount:450,000 $OPWe currently support two stableswap pools for bridging into and out of Optimism:StablecoinsETHCollectively, both pools have faciilitated nearly $120 million in volume.Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 1.00.50 PM984√ó118 8.67 KBWe currently incentivize each pool with close to 12k SYN (around $36k) per week, or roughly 624,000 SYN (around $2m) per year and have close to $30m of TVL across both pools. Given our stablecoin pool was launched more recently, it only represents 20% of our Optimism TVL.We plan to use a portion of the $OP to incentivize our existing stablecoin pool on Optimism to create a much deeper pool for users to trade / bridge into. Along with the new OP incentives, we will add USDT and DAI to the pool which currently supports USDC and nUSD liquidity. Combined with the SYN emissions we are already contributing, we believe this will be one of the more attractive stablecoin pools in the market and will bring many more users into the Optimism ecosystem. Similarly, since the Optimism ecosystem is still nascent, we think this will become the deepest stableswap pool on Optimism, allowing users to seamlessly move in and out of different stablecoins.The more liquidity supplied in each pool, the cheaper it becomes for users to bridge between chains due to a reduction in slippage. This is important as we have noticed from experience on other chains that quite a lot of users have a preference to use stablecoins as a medium for bridging, rather than ETH. As the Optimism ecosystem grows, users will need a seamless solution to enter it, and we intend to Synapse to be that tool.Token HoldersAmount:400,000 $OPHistorically, most SYN liquidity has lived on a number of Ethereum based pools, namely SYN/ETH, SYN/FRAX, and SYN/FEI. This has priced out a lot of prospective holders given the gas fees. In an effort to make it more affordable for users to acquire and trade SYN, we propose creating a new SYN/Stablecoin pool on Curve‚Äôs Optimism instance. As the Synapse network continues to decentralize, it will be imperative for there to be affordable venues to acquire SYN and participate in the cross-chain message validation process.We would direct a portion of the $OP towards incentivizing this pool to ensure proper liquidity.  As soon as liquidity is sufficient, we expect a strong influx of users onto Optimism. SYN tokens are currently being emitted on over 10 chains and lots of liquidity providers, especially small to medium sized ones, do not necessarily want to pay ETH gas fees to trade their rewards. Bridging SYN to Optimism to trade it will become natural for those liquidity providers, therefore leading to a large influx of new wallets on Optimism. Additionally, that pool will constantly be arbed vs. other SYN pools (including SYN/ETH where the price depends of ETH) leading to an additional pick-up in activity.How will the distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?More BuildersMore tools and applications built leveraging Synapse means more avenues for users to enter the Optimism ecosystem.Stablecoin LiquidityAdditional liquidity incentives for our Optimism stableswap pool will increase Optimism TVL, in turn making Optimism one of the most efficient venues to trade stablecoins through. The more TVL that enters the ecosystem, the better it is for users, and the more potential users that Optimism can lock into their ecosystem.More Optimism UsersWith the SYN/Stablecoin Curve pool on Optimism, we expect more users will enter the ecosystem in order to 1) more affordably trade SYN and 2) bridge their SYN and stablecoins into optimism. Both equate to more Optimism users and TVL.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?All of the projects that are funded by our grants program will persist long after the $OP has been used. Many of the developers that are onboarded through the grants program will be exposed to building on Optimism, and may end up dedicating more time to building future projects in the ecosystemOur TVL has been much stickier relative to other networks. We expect liquidity providers, users, and traders of our Optimism pools to be quite sticky.The SYN/Stablecoin pool we‚Äôre proposing will very likely be the most affordable avenue for users to trade SYN far after the incentives are done as all of the main liquidity sources still lives on Ethereum. For reference, there was a SYN/AVAX pool created last year on Trader Joe. While this pool is no longer incentivized, it still has around $500k of TVL and a daily turnover which is sometimes higher than its own liquidity.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributedWe expect for these incentives to be distributed over the course of the next 6 monthsHow much will your project match in co-incentivesSynapse is planning on emitting at least 312,000 SYN tokens (around $1m) to liquidity providers on Optimism in the next 6 months","Synapse Protocol, a cross-chain communication network with $38.9M TVL, requests 1,000,000 OP tokens.  Distribution will benefit developers (150,000 OP for grants and tooling), liquidity providers (450,000 OP for incentivizing stablecoin pools, increasing Optimism TVL and user access), and token holders (400,000 OP for a SYN/stablecoin pool on Curve). This strategy aims to attract builders, boost liquidity, and onboard new users to Optimism, with lasting effects due to the project's sticky TVL and the ongoing utility of funded projects.  Synapse will co-incentivize with at least $1M in SYN tokens over six months.

We‚Äôd like to provide dev integration support valued at $20k per month (1-4 projects / month) over a time period of 6-9 months (up to $180k) in total.Apart from technical integration one of our biggest strengths is the content we produce, especially regarding the bridging space, to support understanding of emerging ecosystems. In the past we‚Äôve e.g. written the bridges articles for the Ethereum Foundation (e.g.Introduction to blockchain bridges | ethereum.org) or published educational content regardingArbitrary Messaging Bridges.We‚Äôd love to create content in terms of Optimism bridging in general (which we‚Äôd be happy to white label) as well as for specific projects. Marketing channels we will use to spread such knowledge are content posts in Twitter Threads, announcement articles, cross-chain insider newsletter, substack, Q&A interviews, Twitter spaces, Discord/Telegram and additional ways on a per team basis.Proposal for token distribution:As a bridge aggregator we provide the most straight-forward path for users and projects to onboard to Optimism. We‚Äôd like to support this with financial incentives for users (initial gas) to get started on Optimism as well as financial and technical support for projects to enable bridging to Optimism throughLI.FI.How will the OP tokens be distributed?Incentivize transfers to Optimism by providing initial gas for all bridges (50%)In terms of initial gas we believe 0.003 ETH (~3.8 USD) for users after first time bridging is a good starting point to make transactions and interact with dApps on Optimism. At the current OP/ETH price we could onboard roughly ~26k new users to Optimism with that.Support projects to integrate bridging to Optimism throughLI.FI(50%)We‚Äôd like to enable more projects to support Optimism and onboard users from other chains to Optimism. For that we‚Äôd like to provide different grants to such projects depending on the size and complexity of the integration. Smaller ones (<10k) for simple SDK / widget integrations and larger ones for deeper integrations including e.g. cross-chain contract calls.The priority will be for projects deployed on Optimism and seeking bridging from other chains.In addition to these grants we‚Äôll provide technical and content marketing support to such projects, especially larger ones.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?Currently we expect the time period for distribution to be around 6-9 months. This may vary though depending on market development, developer/user adoption, project integration speeds and further external factors.How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?The initial gas amounts will make it easier and more financially attractive for users to move assets to Optimism and start using dApps there.The financial and technical support for bridge integration will enable more projects to easily allow their users to adopt Optimism coming from other chains.Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.KPI for initial gas incentives:number of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to OptimismKPIs for project support to integrate OP bridging:number of projects supporttotal amount of financial support / grants given out to these projectsnumber of new users who have received initial gas after bridging to Optimism (same as above as requested in feedback comments)Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?Over time users will be used to the UX of bridging to OP and enjoy the simplicity of being able to do so directly through different dApps‚Äô integrated swapping/bridging capabilities powered byLI.FI. This improved first user experience with dApps on OP will provide a great entry point for more long-term usage.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:Smart contract addresses can be found here:Deployments - LI.FI Documentation","LI.FI, a cross-chain bridge aggregator (Chris, chris@li.finance), seeks a $200,000 Optimism grant (Cycle 7) to incentivize Optimism adoption.  LI.FI's user-friendly widget and SDK simplify cross-chain asset transfers, already boasting 80,342 unique users and $260M in transfer volume.  The grant will fund initial gas incentives for users bridging to Optimism (50%) and provide technical/marketing support for projects integrating LI.FI (50%), fostering sustainable growth by improving user experience and expanding Optimism's reach.  Key performance indicators include new users and projects integrated.  LI.FI's open-source code and existing partnerships (Alchemix, DeFi Saver, etc.) demonstrate its capacity for significant impact on the Optimism ecosystem.

We‚Äôve ran various liquidity mining programs on Polygon, Fantom, Moonriver, Arbitrum etc. We‚Äôve helped kick start liquidity in various ecosystems and plan to continue to do so. Recent deployments in 2022:Metis LaunchKava LaunchBoba LaunchOptimism LaunchArbitrum NovaCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:UniswapTraderJoeSpookyswapIs/will this project be open sourced?:Yes, Sushi has always been open sourced.Optimism native?:MultichainDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:Sushi got deployed on Optimism in May 2022. Check out the announcementhere.Project Description, Optimism Alignment & Ecosystem Value Proposition:Sushiswap is currently one of the leading decentralized exchanges which was launched in August 2020. The protocol adopts an AMM model and has facilitated over $225.05B worth of trades since its inception.Sushi products deployed on Optimism (Over the past 3 months):TridentSushiXSwapComing soon: Limit orders, Kashi, MISO & Permissionless Onsen Farms, Trident Stable Swap PoolsThe team at Sushi plans to use this grant to help increase the liquidity of the Optimism ecosystem.How will the OP tokens be distributed?All of the OP tokens granted to Sushi will be distributed to liquidity providers who help bootstrap the initial Optimism liquidity for Trident with cross-chain swaps via SushiXSwap being the focus. SushiXSwap is a unified, multichain UI for swapping tokens across any of the major chains.The team solves the liquidity crunch by plugging into our own Sushi liquidity pools which are currently deployed on over 18 different chains. Being able to use this liquidity guarantees our users to always receive the best price for any pair across all the chains. SushiXSwap can be currently usedhere.With cross-chain swaps in mind for the rewards, we‚Äôre proposing to incentive these 3 pairs to start:OP-ETH 1% (500 $OP per day for 180 days)ETH-USDC 0.05% (1500 $OP per day for 180 days)ETH-USDT 0.05% (800 $OP per day for 180 days)OP rewards will be used to bootstrap the 1% fee tier for OP-ETH, and 0.05% USDT/USDC - ETH pairs. Each of the pairs will be constant product pools (50-50), and will have TWAP oracles enabled. With the OP rewards we will be targeting around 10% APR on $10m in TVL for ETH-USDC, $5m for ETH-USDT, and $3m for OP-ETH.With liquid ETH-USDC & ETH-USDT pools an easy gateway will open up to allow users on other chains to easily swap tokens from the source chain to Optimism tokens. Main benefit being the ability to top up gas on Optimism wallets via swaps on any source chain Sushi is deployed on.For example w/ fee tiers and stargate‚Äôs 0.06% bridge fee, users will be able to swap from MATIC on Polygon to ETH on Optimism with a 0.16% fee. Also with a 1% fee tier on the OP-WETH pair it will ensure that swaps from any chains on Sushi will be routed through the Optimism OP-WETH pair with all of the fees staying within the OP ecosystem.How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?Sushi has plans to co-incentivize the liquidity pools as well. With targeted 10% APRs on the pairs, we believe this provides enough rewards to bootstrap the main pairs enough to get things kick started for cross-chain swaps and help increase the activity & usage on Optimism. We‚Äôll also be looking to bootstrap other pairs with SUSHI as they work their way into the onsen program. With increased liquidity on OP, it‚Äôll also open the opportunity for native projects to have a place for their token to become liquid for cross-chain swaps as well.Added benefits in the form of BentoBox‚Äôs strategies will also deploy idle capital (OP, WETH, USDC, USDT) within the Optimism ecosystem, and thus will help aid in increasing usage and liquidity across OP.Sushi has previously run similar dual rewards for LPs on Polygon, Gnosis, MoonRiver, Fantom, etc.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?The plan is to kickstart cross-chain activity with bootstrapped OP rewards for 180 days, and SUSHI rewards continuing after the OP rewards end (potentially also recycled Sushi from fees w/ implementation ofMeji proposal). Expectations are that volume will reach levels that it continues to be profitable w/o rewards, and liquidity will be sticky enough for long-term usage of the cross-chain swap functionality.Additionally, Sushi has plans to deploy each of our other products on Optimism and with bootstrapped liquidity it will be a good kickstart for activity from day one with the additional products like Miso, Kashi, Furo and Limit Orders.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?The rewards will be distributed over a 180 days period.Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what‚Äôs the status of these tokens?Sushi has not received any grants from OP. This is the first proposal submitted.How much will your project match in co-incentives?Initially Sushi will be able to reward similar rates as we do on other chains, with 100-300 SUSHI per day being the initial targets for each pair plus expansion into rewarding other pairs as they pop up or work into the onsen program.300 Sushi per day for ETH-USDC250 Sushi per day for ETH-USDT150 Sushi per day for OP-ETHThe above are rates similar to what we incentivize on Arbitrum (700 sushi per day in total).Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:Sushi‚Äôs Treasury (ETH Mainnet): 0xe94B5EEC1fA96CEecbD33EF5Baa8d00E4493F4f3","Sushiswap, a leading decentralized exchange with $1.14B TVL, requests 504,000 OP tokens for its Optimism deployment.  This grant will incentivize liquidity provision for key trading pairs (OP-ETH, ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT) via SushiXSwap, a cross-chain swapping platform.  The 180-day program offers high APRs (around 10%) to bootstrap liquidity, leveraging Sushi's existing multi-chain infrastructure and BentoBox strategies.  Post-incentive, sustained liquidity is expected due to the profitability of cross-chain swaps and the planned deployment of additional Sushi products on Optimism.  Sushi will match incentives with SUSHI tokens, ensuring long-term ecosystem growth.

ARCHIVED  & OLD Missions,[DRAFT][GF: Phase 1] Growth Experiments Grant: BTC holders bridge to Ethereum in a trust-minimized way,https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-growth-experiments-grant-btc-holders-bridge-to-ethereum-in-a-trust-minimized-way/5638,"Growth Experiments Grant: BTC holders bridge to Ethereum in a trust-minimized wayBasic DetailsProject name:Threshold tBTCAuthor name and contact info:John Packel,john.packel@gmail.com, hello@threshold.networkL2 recipient address:0x7fB50BBabeDEE52b8760Ba15c0c199aF33Fc2EfAWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for?Season 3, Cycle 11Project DetailsWhat are you building?tBTC is a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant Bitcoin bridge. However, Bitcoin holders cannot leverage their BTC in the Optimism ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.With thelaunch of tBTC v2it‚Äôs now possible to bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum in a trust-minimized way. We propose a solution to bridge tBTC to Optimism in the near-term.To make the user experience of bridging tBTC from L1 to Optimism as seamless as possible and to avoid the proliferation of non-compatible wrapped tBTC tokens resulting in fragmented liquidity, Threshold will implement a minter contract that delegates restricted minting authority to the native Optimism bridge, along with a short-list of ecosystem bridges (e.g. Wormhole, L0, etc.).This contract will have a minting authority for TBTC on Optimism but can be paused by any one ofntBTC guardians (Threshold tBTC Guardians - General - Threshold Network), allowing avoidance of contagion in case of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.Later, Threshold may implement the ability to mint tBTC directly from Bitcoin on Optimism, without Ethereum L1 as an interim step, if it is sensible to do so.Please see a full discussion of the approach here:https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/pull/542/files?short_path=1eac321#diff-1eac3218e60358ae0a0073e86b51a233f1b9294b6d0b441a534d41f92c983f7cWhy do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?Threshold is the network formed by the first-ever decentralized network ‚Äúmerger‚Äù betweenNuCypherandKeep. Version 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL, but the security model of stakers providing 150% collateralization in ETH was very capital inefficient.Combining networks, communities and stakers, we launched tBTC v2 on January 31st. In the several month period before permissionless minting, a nominated group of ‚ÄúMinters‚Äù (in partnership with Curve DAO), Yearn.Finance, Synthetix, Connext and Alchemix) make the decision to mint tBTC instead of stakers, with a failsafe group of ‚ÄúGuardians‚Äù (Catalog, BadgerDAO, Stake Capital, Entropy, and many community members) given the opportunity to cancel fraudulent or improper mints.If this grant is approved, the solution will bridge Optimism to the largest digital asset in a trust-minimized way, enabling BTC to be used as collateral in the lending protocols, AMMs, and derivatives platforms on Optimism.How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate:Version 1 of tBTC went live in April 2020 and hit a peak of ~$300M TVL. Key metrics for v2 are available here:https://dune.com/threshold/tbtcHow will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism?Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism:We propose to deploy a canonical tBTC contract on Optimism that is flexible enough to:Delegate restricted minting authority to a short list of ecosystem bridgesDelegate restricted minting authority to the native Optimism bridge, in the futureBe paused by any one of n guardians, allowing avoidance of contagion in case of a chain- or bridge-specific incident.Be governed by the Threshold Council until we can land on a longer-term cross-chain governance mechanism.Rather than change our L1 implementation to be aware of L2s and sidechains, we‚Äôll start as simply as possible. Every tBTC mint will continue to require transactions on Ethereum from the user ‚Äî first a deposit reveal, then a lock to bridge to Optimism.Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.tBTC targets Bitcoin holders who want to do more with the asset by participating in DeFi. Defining characteristics include a strong preference for decentralized solutions over the highly centralized WBTC with its custodied asset approach by BitGo and selected merchants.How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?The process of bridging from L1 to Optimism would look as follows:There is a tBTC holder on L1. The holder goes to the Wormhole Portal and selects Optimism.The holder submits one transaction to L1 locking their tBTC tokens in the bridge‚Äôs smart contract. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15 minutes for the Ethereum block finality.The holder submits one transaction to tBTC on Optimism. After that transaction is mined, they have their tBTC on Optimism.The process of bridging from Optimism to L1 looks as follows:There is a tBTC holder on Optimism. That holder goes to the Wormhole Portal and selects Optimism.The holder submits one transaction to tBTC on Optimism that is burning the token. After the transaction is mined, they wait about 15 minutes for block finality.The holder submits one transaction to L1 unlocking their tBTC tokens from the bridge‚Äôs smart contract. After that transaction is mined, they have their tBTC on L1.This smart contract is integrated with step 3 of L1->L2 bridging and step 1 of L2->L1 or L2->L2 bridging. When the user redeems token on Optimism, this contract receives the Wormhole tBTC representation and mints the canonical tBTC in an equal amount. When the user sends their token from L1, this contract burns the canonical tBTC and sends Wormhole tBTC representation through the bridge in an equal amount.Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:Demo:tBTC Minting Demo VideoPermissionlessly Bridge your Bitcoin to Ethereum DeFi with tBTCWebsite:https://threshold.network/Twitter:https://twitter.com/TheTNetwork,https://twitter.com/tBTC_projectDiscord/Discourse/Community:Threshold Network ‚úúGithub:GitHub - threshold-network/threshold: Threshold Network tooling.Technical/Economic Documentation:https://docs.threshold.network/Threshold DAO Notion site:https://www.notion.so/thresholdnetwork/Welcome-to-the-Threshold-DAO-3e51fdedbd804ff1b11f00a7c750b118Do you have any metrics on the project currently?

(250k OP max)200,000 OPHow do you justify the size of the grant?This is an appropriate amount given the enormity of the capital in Bitcoin and holders desire to lend, borrow, stake, etc. The OP tokens will be allocated as incentives on qualified protocols.Roadmap and Distribution PlanDescribe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:Minter contracts will be deployed to Optimism. The first ecosystem bridge will be whitelisted on the contract. A liquidity pool will be deployed on Curve and, potentially, Velodrome. After a sufficient amount of liquidity builds (facilitated by OP incentives), tBTC will become an interesting collateral for lending protocols like Sonne and Euler. Further use cases may be developed across the Optimism ecosystem, such as derivatives (e.g. Lyra, Synthetix v3).How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See theno sale rule here 1):To encourage the rapid development of tBTC TVL, 100% of the OP tokens will be distributed as incentives for users to mint/bridge tBTC on Optimism. The OP tokens will be allocated as incentives on qualified protocols potentially including Curve and Velodrome for liquidity, Sonne Finance and Euler for lending, and Lyra and Synthetix V3 (once new collateral types are enabled) for derivatives.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?We propose distributing the OP tokens over 2-3 months towards qualified protocol (e.g. Curve, Velodrome, Sonne, Euler, Synthetix V3, Lyra).Please define benchmark milestones for this project.Baseline milestones:tBTC minter contract deployed on Optimism by May 1, 2023tBTC factory pool on Curve deployed on Optimism by May 15, 2023Integration with at least one lending protocol (e.g., Sonne or Euler) - timing dependent on that protocol‚Äôs readinessPlease provide critical milestones for this project.Remaining 60% of OP grant allocated after the following critical milestones have been reached:100 tBTC bridged by July 15, 2023tBTC factory pool surpasses current size of sBTC/wBTC pool (66 BTC as of 3/13/23) by July 15, 2023Potentially integration with at least one derivatives protocol (e.g. Lyra or Synthetix V3)If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?Liquidity begets liquidity. The OP incentives period will enable tBTC to bootstrap itself on Optimism via integrations with Curve, Velodrome, Lyra, etc. With a sufficient amount of tBTC bridged to Optimism, liquid spot + derivatives markets, and arbitrage opportunities between OP tBTC<>L1 tBTC<>native BTC continued organic usage of tBTC on Optimism is likely after incentives dry up.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.):docs.threshold.networkEthereum MainnetOptimism RelationshipDoes your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?Bitcoin holders cannot leverage their BTC in the Optimism ecosystem in a trust-minimized way. tBTC on Optimism will provide the decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant Bitcoin bridge that many Bitcoin holders prefer.Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?tBTC‚Äôs long-term goal is for 10-20% of Bitcoin to bridge to Ethereum. Our version 1 proved the demand in spite of its capital requirements, tBTC v2 is the best decentralized solution and many of our users will choose to bridge via Optimism.Is your project Optimism Native?NoConfirmationsI confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 28 and Growth Experiments 29 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee:YesI understand that Growth Experiments grants are subject to a ‚Äúno sale rule,‚Äù as explained in this post, and I have read the terms of the rule:Yes","Threshold Network seeks a $200,000 OP grant to bridge their decentralized Bitcoin bridge, tBTC v2, to Optimism.  tBTC v2 offers a trust-minimized solution, unlike centralized alternatives.  This integration will enable Bitcoin holders to leverage their assets within Optimism's DeFi ecosystem, increasing user interaction through lending, AMMs, and derivatives.  The grant will fund a canonical tBTC contract on Optimism, incentivizing bridging via OP token rewards distributed over 2-3 months to protocols like Curve and Velodrome.  This bootstrapping strategy aims to establish lasting liquidity and organic growth, even after incentives end.  Threshold's experience with tBTC v1 (peaking at ~$300M TVL) and strong partnerships demonstrate their capability to deliver.

We follow a quit‚Ä¶Project OverviewProject description (please explain how your project works):Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure bridge between L1 and L2s. Across protocol is a novel bridging method that combines an optimistic oracle, bonded relayers and single-sided liquidity pools to provide decentralized instant transactions from rollup chains to and from Ethereum mainnet.Across Protocol supports bridging to and from Optimism from Ethereum mainnet and L2s. UMA launched Across Protocol in early November 2021. Across is a bridging solution which uses UMA‚Äôs Optimistic Oracle.Project links:Website:https://across.to/Twitter:https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocolDiscord/Discourse/Community:AcrossPlease include all other relevant links below:Github:Across Protocol ¬∑ GitHubDocs:https://docs.across.to/bridge/(you can find our audit here)Additional team member info(please link):Hart Lambur, Kevin Chan, David Korpi, Nick Pai, and many more.

The mission of Risk Labs and our project teams is to make global markets universally fair, accessible, secure and decentralized. UMA is an optimistic oracle (OO) that can record any knowable truth onto a blockchain. The OO empowers and secures a diverse ecosystem of web3 applications including the Across bridge.https://umaproject.org/Relevant usage metrics(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):Total Bridge Volume: $664,763,116TVL: $62,864,876 in totalTotal Unique Bridge Users: 105,409Total Transfers: 215,631Community-built dashboard can be found here -https://dune.com/unionepro/Across-Protocol-StatsCompetitors, peers, or similar projects(please link):We consider Hop (https://hop.exchange/), Stargate (https://stargate.finance/), and Synapse (Synapse Protocol) to be our closest competitors for the chains we operate on.Is/will this project be open sourced?Yes. Github link above.Optimism native?:NoDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:Across has supported Optimism since it launched in November of 2021Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?NoDid the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?:NoIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?:N/AValue AddEcosystem Value Proposition:From a bridging perspective, there are two main barriers to entry for onboarding users into this ecosystem.Optimistic rollup canonical bridges have a 7 day withdrawal period. This can leave users feeling ‚Äústuck‚Äù on L2 if they don‚Äôt trust or aren‚Äôt aware of bridge protocols that can help them move between chains in a much shorter period of time.A thriving L2 ecosystem is only possible if we also have a competitive and robust network of bridges to support connection between chains. Bridges are particularly vulnerable to exploits, so many newcomers to the ecosystem might be unsure about trying a bridging protocol.Our proposal aims to solve the above problems by providing an on/off ramp to the ecosystem that will be nearly instantaneous in both directions, and nearly free of cost for users traveling TO Optimism. Our fully audited bridging solution is built on top of UMA‚Äôs Optimistic Oracle, which has been battle tested for nearly 2 years and secures hundreds of millions of dollars.Users will only receive the tokens if they bridge assets to Optimism or run a relayer on Optimism. Both of these require people to move their funds to Optimism, and our hope is that they will find all the great dapps on Optimism and want to stay!How much will your project match in co-incentives?(not required but recommended, when applicable):Across will match up to 320% in co-incentives using the ACX token. Details on this can be found below in the Distribution section.Proposal for token distribution:We have two planned mechanisms for the distribution of $OP tokens. We will use 75% of the tokens to subsidize bridge fees for users that would like to transfer assets to Optimism. Currently, we support USDC, ETH, DAI, WBTC, USDT, BAL, and UMA. The remaining 25% of the tokens will be used to reward anyone who runs a relayer on Optimism.Bridge UsersFor any user going to Optimism, Across will provide $ACX incentives alongside the $OP. The amount of this $ACX co-incentive can be as high as 320% of the $OP incentive dependent on whether or not the bridgooor uses an Across referral link to do their transaction. An example of how it could be that high is if a user self refers in Across, they will receive 80% of their bridge fee in $ACX and only 25% in $OP (for a total of 105% rebate). 80%/25% is a 320% co-incentive. their bridge fee 105% (so they will earn 5% to bridge to Optimism). The composure of this rebate depends on whether or not the user is already earning $ACX rewards on their transaction. If there is no $ACX reward, the bridge fee will be rebated back 80% $OP and 25% $ACX. If there is an $ACX reward, the $OP amount will be (105%-$ACX%). All of this will be computed on the bridge fee component of a transfer and capped at 12 basis points (which covers the entire fee during periods of low to moderate bridge utilization.)Note: Across differentiates between the bridge fee and the gas fee. This distribution is only applied to bridge fees, so network conditions that cause an increase in gas fees should not make an impact in this program. For more information on our bridge fees, you can seethissection of our docs site.RelayersWe will direct 25% of this grant towards rewarding relayers that facilitate transfers to Optimism. This will be dispersed as 0.01% (1bp) on the amount transferred in each relay. For context, this is equal to a 33% bonus for relayers operating on Optimism. This incentive will last until the 25% is exhausted.Note: This was an addition to the original proposal, which only rewarded bridge users. It was decided that this would serve to enhance the overall bridge experience for Optimism users, making it a worthwhile investment. Having a robust relayer network strengthens the security mechanism of the bridge, and reduces transaction times during high traffic events.DistributionAcross will provide $ACX incentives alongside the $OP. The amount of this $ACX co-incentive can be as high as 320% of the $OP incentive dependent on whether or not the bridgooor uses an Across referral link to do their transaction. An example of how it could be that high is if a user self refers in Across, they will receive 80% of their bridge fee in $ACX and only 25% in $OP (for a total of 105% rebate). 80%/25% is a 320% co-incentive.The rate of distribution will depend on many factors. The main ones include amount of bridging we see to Optimism, whether or not it‚Äôs through a referral link, and the Optimism token price. It is expected that we will spend these tokens at a slower rate than other bridges since other bridges are able to incentivize Optimism liquidity pools, whereas our bridge model does not require a liquidity pool on each destination chain. (Note: we believe this is a good thing, as incentivizing LPs can cause mercenary capital to farm rewards). Given all of these factors, we estimate 12-18months for distribution. We believe this is an appropriate amount of time to distribute the tokens, primarily because we hope to establish long-term association for users bridging to Optimism. These tokens will help to make it nearly costless and effortless to move assets to Optimism when it makes sense for users to do so. If the grant distribution time is too short, it could unintentionally generate activities that attempt to farm the reward.We also recognize that there will be external factors that may lead to farming as well. In such an event, we would expect to adjust the OP rewards distribution in a way that reduces this farming potential. Our goal is not to allow users to farm and sell $OP to bank a profit and not use the optimism ecosystem. We will keep the optimism delegates aware of any such actions, should they ever be necessary. We would like to be the bridge of choice for any user that ever needs to move tokens to Optimism as more and more assets migrate to Optimism.Depending on the optimism token price and whether or not people use ACX referral links, this program should fund between $500 million and $1 billion of volume to Optimism.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)You can find links to all of our smart contracts in our docs site (linked above). The wallet listed above as the receiving wallet will hold these tokens until a distribution contract has been deployed. Upon doing so, this information will be supplied to OP governance for additional accountability.","This proposal requests 750,000 OP tokens for Across Protocol, a fast, cheap, and secure bridge between L1 and L2s, including Optimism.  Across, built by Risk Labs, uses a novel bridging method with a proven track record ($664M bridged volume, $62M TVL).  75% of the tokens will subsidize bridge fees for users transferring assets to Optimism, while 25% will reward Optimism relayers.  Across will match incentives with its ACX token, potentially offering up to a 320% co-incentive.  The funds aim to incentivize usage and enhance Optimism's ecosystem by reducing friction for onboarding users.  The project is open-source and has been operating since November 2021.

Follow their code on GitHub.Please explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:Scry is the only framework in the space that allows anyone to create and run a fully independant oracle with full node, contract and even front end control. All other oracle systems require a token and permissioned signers that are unknown to the user.This allows the space to create an open and decentralized underlying layer for data being brought onchain. The only way to decentralize the Optimism network would be not just the layer 1 and 2 but also the core and key components to allow developers and users to have open source and decentralized tools powering their dapps and use cases.We have a framework that allows even non technical users to run fully autonomous oracles fully independently with no control by any other party. This includes the contract, the signers and the node. By allowing anyone to run an oracle in a sustainable, profitable and open way the dapps on top also become decentralized.This helps understand the missionscryprotocol.substack.comIntroducing Data LPsWhat are DLPs?What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?We have developed many of the tools already. We show capability by doing. You can explore the docs atdocs.scry.financeto see the tools in action.

If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.Build a fully capable node with documentation and contract system that can be used by anyone to run a fully jndependant oracle. The following features will be developed that are NEW and not already seen as we already have super powerful and key tools for apj interfaces for arbitrary endpoints and VRFCross chain data access by interfacing with layer 1 and able to access data such as block data, contract state and balances.

We are looking at a token later potentially if needed but the token would only be for us to have some way to sustain the free and open source and permissionless tools and infrastructure we create. We currently have had no funding, other than a 5k in OP from retro pgf and are fully self funded up to now from our own funds personally. So the only path forward would either be a token or a grant to keep being able to build.","Scry, a decentralized oracle infrastructure framework, seeks a $200,000 Optimism Foundation grant to enhance its self-deployable oracle system.  Currently bootstrapped with personal funds and a small RetroPGF grant, Scry enables anyone to create and run independent oracles, promoting true decentralization on Optimism.  The grant will fund developer compensation, security audits, and user/project incentives to onboard at least three additional nodes and two projects by October.  Success will be measured by the number of users and projects utilizing the infrastructure,  directly contributing to Optimism's decentralization through open-source, permissionless tools.  A critical milestone is building a fully functional, documented node system enabling independent oracle deployment with cross-chain data access.

Protocols have a choice of where to deploy and Velodrome and matching our efforts with targeted incentive programs provide the most compelling case for a focused investment in the Optimistic vision.That is why we believe that to grow awareness and engagement with the Optimistic Vision, we need to employ every avenue at our disposal to get access to those builders that could be of interest to Optimism. And in our experience, no amount of words or guides alone can compare with direct, in-person engagement. This grant would support Velodrome‚Äôs own considerable efforts to grow the ecosystem and provide the tools to continue to attract the best and brightest in Web3 and get them invested in the Optimistic Vision.We propose 100,000 OP to be used as bounties to incentivize individuals in the Optimism community to surface and introduce new protocols to Velodrome to onboard to the Optimism Collective. We would target bounties of roughly 2k per referral.

The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you‚Äôve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.Web3‚Äôs main hurdle right now is its complexity, making it tricky for beginners to wrap their heads around it. For a lot of people, it feels like wrestling with both the convoluted world of the internet and the complexities of finance simultaneously. Our aim is to make web3 navigation smoother and to tackle the issue of discovering the right apps, tools, and resources. We‚Äôve outlined the following milestones to help us do just that:Milestone 1:By July‚Äôs end, we aim to expand our listings by featuring a minimum of 500 new applications/tools/resources, with at least 150 of these actively available on Optimism. Each application listing should include a basic description, a Q&A segment to guide users, a snapshot of the website, and their Twitter and website links. Some apps might also feature links to external useful resources (e.g. video to set up a specific wallet).Milestone 2:By mid-August, we expect to significantly enrich the Optimism page with comprehensive information and external resource links that explain Optimism, demonstrate how to bridge, provide links to governance forums, and more. This page should also include a detailed FAQ section to assist newcomers.Milestone 3:By early September, we plan to establish and launch the blogging section of our website, which will serve as a crucial tool for disseminating information and resources about Optimism.Milestone 4:By mid-September, marking the end of the season, we should have composed and published approximately 10 detailed articles focusing on Optimism. These articles will cover topics like what a layer 2 like Optimism is, what users can anticipate from it, guides to bridging and using apps, and more.How should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.By July 31st, we‚Äôre aiming to list over 500 new apps, including 150 active on Optimism. That‚Äôs our goal to help grow the ecosystem.By August 17th, we‚Äôll jazz up the Optimism page (Optimism | Web3xplorer) with much more info.By September 4th, we‚Äôll have our blogging section live and kicking.By September 18th, you should see around 10 articles about Optimism up on our site, linked right from Optimism‚Äôs dedicated page on Web3xplorer.How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson‚Äôs impact in the next round of RetroPGF.To see how much impact this mission‚Äôs had, badgeholders can look at two main things:How many unique folks visited Web3xplorer during Season 4. More visitors means more people are catching on to what we‚Äôre doing.The total page views for apps that are up and running on Optimism and the Optimism page itself. This shows how much people are interacting with Optimism-related content on our site.We‚Äôll supply the relevant stats and info from our web analytics tool to measure these two factors effectively.Breakdown of Mission budget request:Assuming a standard workweek of 40 hours with an hourly rate of 50 OP:Development of the blogging functionality: We‚Äôll be using NextJS and exposing blog content over an API (Strapi) while storing the data in a PostgreSQL database in markdown format. This would take about 3 weeks, or 6000 OP.Expanding our database: We‚Äôre planning to load up our database with a heap of new apps and tools. This would require about 4 weeks of work, which equates to 8000 OP. We estimate that each app listing will take us between 15 to 20 minutes.Writing blog articles: We have a target to create 10 blog pieces, which we expect will take us about 2 weeks or 4000 OP, at a rate of one article per day.Please note: Some of the funds might be used to reward contributors who step up to help us find and verify content, as well as contribute towards creating awesome articles.I confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones:YesI confirm that I have read and understand thegrant policies:YesI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant:YesI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlinedhere:Yes","Web3xplorer, a curated web platform (web3xplorer.com), seeks an 18,000 OP Ember grant to expand its directory of Web3 apps, resources, and tools, focusing on Optimism.

Having more active and interested delegates would be a huge benefit to the Optimism Collective as a whole. But we have a problem‚Ä¶ delegates have no insight into data on their own delegation. Currently the only information that is readily available to delegates on all major websites is the total amount of OP delegated and the # of delegating addresses. This limits the agency of delegates, especially new and growing ones, and as a result limits participation in governance.OPdelegate.comsolves these problems by creating the go-to website for Optimism Delegates. Specifically, it will provide address-specific information for delegates to understand, manage, and grow their delegation on Optimism. Think ‚Äúzapper.fifor delegates‚Äù.Examples of statistics on this website would be:Total delegation over timenumber of delegating addresses over time‚ÄúDemographics‚Äù of delegating addresses (size, activity, etc.)By having access to the most important information, delegates will have the agency to see how their decisions and activity affect their delegation, leading to the opportunity to make data-driven decisions. The existence of this tool will increase overall delegate involvement in governance and provide a growth for new and growing delegates.While the initial goal of this grant is to build a wallet-specific dashboard for delegates, the ultimate goal is to be a one-stop-shop for all things Optimism delegation. All parts of the website will be open-source, meaning that this code will be available for other projects to integrate and that outside contributors will be welcome to contribute.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Michael Vander MeidenThrough being one of the most active delegates in Optimism governance, Michael has experienced the key pain points of new and active delegates. Through hosting the community calls, Michael has been at the center of delegate discussion for almost the entire existence of the token house. Along the way, Michael has answered countless questions from and helped guide many new delegates just starting their journey. These experiences have made Michael one of the most knowledgeable within Optimism‚Äôs Token House on the delegate journey. All of this experience makes this Alliance strongly positioned to design and build the product that delegates need.As far as ability to execute, Michael draws on his experience as a software engineer and later a product manager at a venture-funded startup (http://www.stockwell.ai/).

Along with the increase in duration, we increased the amount of incentivizes requested to ensure deep liquidity.Project Name:xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and Uniswap V3 StakerAuthor Name:xToken Terminal and Gamma StrategiesNumber of OP tokens requested:900,000L2 Recipient Address:0x38138586AedB29B436eAB16105b09c317F5a79ddRelevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)xToken: $3.5M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)Gamma: $4.2M USD in TVL (Defi Llama)Optimism alignment (up to 200-word explanation):The following is a joint proposal by xToken Terminal & Gamma Strategies to outline a path forward for OP liquidity incentives on Uniswap V3. This is an updated version of our June 2ndpre-proposal, which received strong community support. From that version, we‚Äôve reduced the amount of tokens requested ‚Äì we recommend Optimism start with an initial 10-week program and then reassess continuation of the program.Terminal‚Äôs out-of-the-box solution allows projects to deploy a highly configurable Uni V3 liquidity mining (LM) program in a matter of minutes, no dev work or technical expertise required. Terminal is live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.Gamma has been actively managing liquidity on Uniswap V3 since March 2021 and prides itself on optimal LP strategies using its machine learning algorithms and automated strategies. Gamma is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and Polygon.The OP token is finally live, ushering in a new era for L2 Ethereum. For now, Optimism is the only leading ETH scaling solution with a liquid token. The OP token ‚Äì which serves a focal role in the governance of the network ‚Äì has already generated significant investor interest. As such, bootstrapping a strong, stable foundation of liquidity for the token is essential.While the token is trading on multiple CEXes, most DEX liquidity looks to be bootstrapped by independent actors and perhaps professional market makers. This is an undesirable state of affairs for a token, project and community with a commitment to transparency, decentralization and permissionlessness. We believe an OP liquidity mining program should be considered.Proposal for token distribution:We propose a total allocation of 900,000 OP tokens for liquidity incentives, distributed evenly across three providers: xToken Terminal, Gamma Strategies, and UniswapV3Staker.After discussion with the Optimism community, we believe that 100% of incentives should be paid out on Optimism via the WETH<>OP 0.3% fee tier pool. Liquidity in this pair is most critical to the success of the Optimism token so we feel a full allocation is the best way to ensure adequate and sustained depth.For a detailed explanation of our analysis and initial design of the LM program, refer to ourpre-proposal discussion.How will the OP tokens be distributed?900,000 OP tokens distributed to LPs over a period of 24 weeks:~33% allocated to each service provider‚Äôs program100% paid out on Optimism100% to WETH<>OP 0.3% poolHow will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?With three different service providers, each will be able to approach liquidity incentives and provision in a way that complements the other two, providing a robust incentives offering for all types of LPs.xToken will provide a user-friendly interface for full range OP liquidity incentives, offering a passive option with lower IL and execution risk for community members who want a simpler LM experience.Gamma will actively manage OP liquidity, concentrating assets right around the spot price and structuring rewards through their platform.UniswapV3Staker will offer a more expressive, dynamic option for more sophisticated LPs looking to rebalance frequently and independently of other LPs.Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?With a 24 week campaign, we‚Äôll be able to attract long-term users and capital from ETH mainnet and other chains. We believe that the user experience and emerging opportunities on the Optimism network will be enough to retain the majority of users after the incentives program ends. As we mentioned above, Optimism is uniquely positioned to obtain LP capital with its native token being first to market of the major L2s.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?Linearly over a period of 24 weeks.How much will your project match in co-incentives?Due to their current emission allocations, it‚Äôs unlikely xToken and Gamma Strategies would be able to match incentives for this program.",Summary not available

His vast experience and leadership in these pioneering projects provide critical insights that help shape our course towards achieving our objectives.Please explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent(Have a look at thePraise Explorerorthis videoto learn more about Praise)Praise enables community members to acknowledge and reward one another‚Äôs contributions. It not only helps us identify who is contributing but also provides insights into the nature of their contributions. This information can be utilized to discern the types of contributions most valuable to the community.Employing Praise cultivates a culture of gratitude and appreciation. Receiving praise for one‚Äôs work can bolster motivation to continue such work, particularly vital for community members who contribute voluntarily. We believe this is directly aligned with the fourth intent‚Äôs stated goal of promoting a welcoming community.We aim to implement Praise on the Optimism Discord server and facilitate the necessary deployment process to ensure Optimism maximizes the benefits of using Praise. We will engage stakeholders, handle technical deployment, prepare the community, help ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù Praise, and provide continual support.Praise creates a dataset containing information about who contributed what, when, and its impact. This data, apart from promoting a welcoming community, can serve as a basis for rewards and reputation.We plan to integrate Praise with Optimism Attestation Station and collectively define what attestations should be created with the community. Possible attestations include:Praise certifies that recipient A has received praise from giver B and has been awarded an impact score of X.Praise certifies that recipient A has accrued a total impact score of X during the defined praise period Y.Praise certifies that recipient A is among the top 10 praise recipients during the praise period Y.These attestations can then be employed to promote more equitable and diverse access to the Citizens‚Äô House governance process, including RetroPGF rounds. Praise is a bottom-up process where anyone can appreciate anyone else for a contribution they deem valuable to the community‚Äôs goals. This inclusive method significantly lowers the barrier to participating in governance.In addition to creating attestations, we also aim to support Optimism in rewarding community members with OP tokens using Praise (subject to separate grant/governance decision). The token rewards are determined by the impact scores calculated by Praise. We will assist the community in defining the rules for distributing OP tokens based on these scores. Rewarding contributing members with OP tokens is an effective method to increase the votable supply and reduce the concentration of voting power.Using Praise to distribute retroactive rewards is very aligned with RetroPGF and is also a great way to distribute OP to the active and appreciated community members.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Praise has been tried and tested over several years and proven to be a useful tool for community building. We, the team have been working with the new version of Praise for the past 2 years and have deployed it for several communities includingGiveth,BanklessDAO,GnosisDAO,Shapeshift,DAppNodeand more.We have a deep understanding of the technology and community dynamics and are well suited to help Optimism deploy Praise and use it to its full potential.To exemplify, here are two successful deployments of Praise:Givethuses Praise to continuously reward contributors with GIV tokens.Quote from community member Suga:Praise is essential. I don‚Äôt think anyone in the community could imagine not having it. Praise is an integral part of the community, that is to say, being able and encouraged to support one another and recognize each other‚Äôs contributions forms part of the basis of what the Giveth community believes in.Token Engineering Commonsused Praise to track contributions during a number of months leading up to the launch of the Commons.Community members were awarded with the non monetary Impact Hours token for their Praise. Impact Hours were then used to determine how many TEC tokens each community member as how much they were trusted to be able to buy in the closed presale (that they called a Hatch), as well as how much they were rewarded at the launch of the token.Please list a critical milestoneThe critical milestone of this proposal is the development and integration of the attestation feature in the Praise Dashboard UI. The successful completion of this milestone would not only make issuing attestations easy and user-friendly but will also serve as a measure of the proposal‚Äôs overall execution.The steps to achieve this milestone includeMapping out the custom attestation needs of the Optimism community: This involves engaging with stakeholders and gathering feedback about the requirements and expectations for the attestation feature.Deploying Praise to the Optimism community and organising a demo session for the community members.Development and integration of the attestation feature into the Praise Dashboard: After successfully developing the feature, it will be integrated into the Praise Dashboard, enhancing its functionality and usability.Testing and refinement of the attestation feature: Rigorous testing will be performed to ensure the newly integrated feature functions optimally.

Kyber is an Ethereum and DeFi pioneer, was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019, and now atop 3 DEX in terms of volume on Optimism.KyberSwap has been deployed on Optimism since July 2022 and shares its motivation for a collaborative cyberspace. OP and KNC incentives would be used by KyberSwap to drive user, liquidity, and ecosystem growth. In particular, KyberSwap plans to work together with top DeFi projects such as Lido, QiDAO, and Synthetix on joint growth activities, as well as leverage our strong presence in Southeast Asia (SEA) to grow the Optimism community (both users and builders) in the region.KyberSwap brings substantial benefits to Optimism users:For Traders:KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from different DEX pools (including KyberSwap‚Äôs), getting the optimal trade route and best price. This may even route volume to external DEXes such as Velodrome or Uniswap depending on the quality of liquidity, thus further contributing to the Optimism ecosystem. Traders can identify tokens that are ‚ÄòTrending‚Äô or ‚ÄòTrending Soon‚Äô using a detection algorithm that tracks on-chain metrics as volume and market cap.For Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools and earn compounding fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping and concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. By extension, this means OP grants used as liquidity incentives would result in a much bigger impact on liquidity and swap rates compared to typical DEXes.For developers: Optimism Dapps and wallets can integrate with KyberSwap pools and aggregation API to provide the best rates for their own users, saving time and resources. Chainlink is already supportingprice feedsfor the KNC token on Optimism so KNC can also be used as collateral on lending platforms.Project links:Website:https://kyberswap.com/|https://kyber.network/Twitter:https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/Discord/Discourse/Community:https://discord.gg/kyberswapDocumentation:https://docs.kyberswap.comGithub:KyberNetwork ¬∑ GitHubAdditional team member info (please link):Founders and AdvisorsVictor Tran: CEO | Forbes 30 under 30| Twitter:https://twitter.com/vutran54Loi Luu: Heading Kyber Ventures | Forbes 30 under 30| Twitter:https://twitter.com/ loi_luu/Yaron Velner: Founder ofB.Protocol, current KyberSwap advisor | Twitter:https://twitter.com/yaron_velnerVitalik Buterin: Advisor, Kyber‚Äôs launchProposal author from Kyber teamShane Hong, Head of Strategy for DAO & Tokenomics | Email: shane@kyber.network | Twitter:https://twitter.com/shaneMkt| Telegram:shaneHkOther team members you can contact:Sasha Mai, Head of Business Development | Email: sasha@kyber.network | Twitter:https://twitter.com/mai_defi| Telegram:sashamaiMelvin, Operations Manager | Email: melvin@kyber.network | Telegram:mrkwhgPlease link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:Kyber is a mature project that is a pioneer in the Ethereum and DeFi space and has been operational for 4+ years without facing any major vulnerability.Kyberinitiatedand co-launchedWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), the most used wrapped version of BTC in the DeFi space today, and we aim to bring similarly innovative initiatives to the Optimism space.Kyber has partnered withLido Financeto bring low slippage, optimized liquidity for liquid staking pairs such as wstETH (as well as USDC, ETH, LDO liquidity) to Optimism and Ethereum.Kyber haspartnered with Multichainto provide an alternative UI with seamless bridging of cross-chain assets to Optimism.Created the Waterloo Cross-chain Bridge in 2019, a decentralized practical bridge between EOS and Ethereum, which inspiredNEAR protocol‚Äôs Rainbow Bridge.Kyber has organized and participated in various hackathons that contributed to the launch of top DeFi projects.

But already deployed on Optimism.Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism:July 13, 2022Ecosystem Value Proposition:What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?Deep crypto liquidity is essential for any burgeoning ecosystem such as Optimism, and this is relevant to both new and mature DeFi or GameFi projects alike. Market makers/liquidity providers need a capital efficient and flexible venue to add liquidity and earn from their contributions. In parallel, traders need a simple method to aggregate liquidity from different DEXes to swap tokens at the best rates. There is a lack of a single DEX platform that offers both important functions (efficient liquidity + best rates through aggregation) at the same time for users, while incentivizing them to participate in the Optimism ecosystem. Moreover, despite a fast-growing community in western regions, Optimism‚Äôs presence in SEA is not as strong as it should be; KyberSwap can help with that.How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?KyberSwap will use the OP grants to bootstrap and deepen liquidity for popular pairs on Optimism. This is achieved by incentivizing liquidity providers to deposit liquidity (and yield farm) into KyberSwap‚Äôsconcentrated liquiditypools, which would enable much more efficient use of their precious capital. KyberSwap would endeavor to utilize the OP grants in a sustainable manner so that liquidity is retained beyond the yield farming period. Moreover, KyberSwap will be using our own KNC funds to encourage more trading on Optimism, further contributing to volume and fees earned by liquidity providers on KyberSwap.Even external DEXes that are integrated by KyberSwap aggregator, such as Velodrome, Uniswap, Curve, BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, or Synthetix, benefit when we direct volume to them (via liquidity aggregation for the best rates).A combination of OP and KNC grants would be used with guidance from OP Labs to grow the Optimism builder ecosystem and community in SEA through grants and business development initiatives.ALL OP grants will be distributed to Optimism users for their benefit.The Kyber team or KyberDAO will not be receiving any of the funds.Grants would be allocated as incentives for popular token pairs that have the highest potential for usage and trade volume on Optimism. This is especially pertinent for pairs that currently lack concentrated liquidity support and are capital inefficient.The following pairs are already being incentivized on KyberSwap with KNC incentives as part of ourOptimism liquidity mining campaign:wstETH / ETHETH / sETHUSDC / DAIUSDC / MAIwstETH / USDCUSDC / USDTUSDC / sUSDETH / USDCUSDT / DAIOP / USDCwstETH / WBTCETH / OPwstETH / MAIOP / KNCETH / KNCmKNC / MAIKNC / LDOAAVE / KNCSNX / KNCPartners:We have partnered withQiDAOandLido Financeto facilitate deeper liquidity for their relevant token pairs on Optimism. The partner pairs being incentivized on Optimism:With Lido FinancewstETH / ETHETH / sETHwstETH / USDCwstETH / WBTCWith QiDAOUSDC / MAIwstETH / MAImKNC / MAIThe following pairs will be considered for OP incentives if we receive them (subject to change; will be further discussed with the Optimism team and community):USDC / SUSDUSDC / USDTUSDC / WETH / wstETHOP / WETH / wstETHDAI / WETH / wstETHUSDT / WETH / wstETHWBTC / WETH / wstETHUSDC / WETH / wstETHOP / USDCOP incentives may be allocated evenly between the pools or according to specific criteria such as the historical trading volume of the token pair and the liquidity level on Optimism etc. Roughly$2M worth of KNCwould be allocated to Optimism users for liquidity mining, with additional rewards for ancillary marketing and community activities.On top of these initial pairs and partners, we will also allocate a portion of grants for future partners.Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?1. Bringing users and developers to OptimismKyberSwap has many Dapp integrations with multi-chain exposure. Using the incentives, we want to enable more users and developers from other networks to bridge to and build on Optimism. This would be the case for popular DeFi projects as well e.g. QiDAO and Lido Finance, whom we are already working with on Optimism.Farming incentives, along with KyberSwap‚Äôs concentrated liquidity, auto-compounding LP fee, and anti-sniping features, will increase TVL and volume, driving higher yields and attracting more LPs. We ran a similar campaign on Polygon last year and hit an ATH TVL of $145M.KyberSwap‚Äôs concentrated liquidity (through Elastic Pools) enables trades to have much better slippage for a given level of TVL when compared to a typical Uni v2 AMM DEX. For example, KyberSwap is alreadythe 3rd highest volume contributor on Optimismdespite not having received any OP and with much less TVL compared to other DEXes on Optimism.2. Deeper liquidity: Swap with better slippage and at the best ratesKyberSwap Elastic‚Äôs concentrated liquidity pools enable high capital efficiency for LPs; similar to the Uni v3 tick-based AMM but with compounded fees for LPs in a full price range pool and anti-sniping/JIT that protects earnings.Unique NFT liquidity position farming mechanism (the first in DeFi to our knowledge) which can account for both time of active liquidity provided and target trading volume of the pool.As a DEX aggregator, KyberSwap users always enjoy the best rates, and this indirectly brings volume and fees to other DEXes on Optimism e.g. Curve, BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, Uniswap, and Synthetix.Developers can integrate KyberSwap‚Äôs aggregator API to enable the best rates for their own Dapp users on Optimism. E.g. KyberSwap was integrated by DEXTools.3. Additional KNC marketing rewardsKyberSwap will provide additional KNC rewards on top of liquidity mining incentives through various marketing activities including referral campaigns, trading contests, lotteries, and airdrops etc., which would help attract more users to Optimism.4. Media coverage of OptimismKyberSwap will be spending resources for owned, earned, and paid PR/Media to promote the liquidity mining campaign and other activities, bringing further attention to the Optimism brand.5. Investments in the Optimism Ecosystem and Community, especially in SEAKyberSwap has a strong community and partner network in the SEA region. Pre-Covid, Kyber ran the largest monthly Ethereum meet-up events in Vietnam and is an active member of the Ethereum community in Singapore. We are long-time members of DeFi Alliance DAO and Asia DeFi Network. We have the experience to invest in and grow the Optimism community at the local grassroots level, especially in SEA.Kyber Ventures actively invests in DeFi/GameFi Dapps and builders and this would apply to Optimism-based projects too. This would help to grow Optimism‚Äôs Dapp ecosystem, which would in turn result in a rise in users, volume, and liquidity.Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback.This proposal is a resubmission under the new required proposal format. The previous proposal under the old format received positive support from multiple parties including at least 2 Optimism delegates:MoneyManDoug:https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-kyberswap/3302/16?u=shanemktMteoptimism:https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-kyberswap/3302/17?u=shanemktKyberSwap is currently a top 3 DEX on Optimism in terms of trading volume. KyberSwap will be allocating our own KNC token co-incentives (~$2M) to complement the OP grants requested.Number of OP tokens requested:250,000 OP.Note: We have revised our requested amount based on feedback from the Grants Council - Growth Experiment Grants subcommittee.Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?:NoIf OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?:N.A.How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable):Roughly$2M worth of KNCwould also be given to Optimism users for liquidity mining, with additional rewards for ancillary marketing and community activities. Some of our KNC incentives will be allocated to future partners. More can be considered depending on the success of the initial campaign and future grants.Proposal for token distribution:How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)60% for liquidity mining campaigns on selected token pairs to benefit Optimism liquidity providers. In addition, KyberSwap will utilize our own KNC funds to grow the Optimism community in SEA, as well as boost trading volume via trading contests and marketing initiatives.30% for strategic liquidity mining partnerships with top DeFi projects such as Lido, QiDAO, and Synthetix, which would help amplify the network effects on Optimism.10% for liquidity mining activities with future partners for the benefit of Optimism users.Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.Over 3-6 months, with ample time for more users to be aware of the campaigns and bridge assets to Optimism. This also gives KyberSwap the flexibility to continually optimize our liquidity mining campaign and marketing efforts for the best possible outcome.We can work with shorter timelines if required and welcome recommendations from the Grants Council.Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.Revised on 24 Feb based onfeedback from the Grants Council.MilestonesMaintaining ourtop 3 positionin DEX trading volume on Optimism, while targeting the No.1 spot as we improve our capital efficiency.Source: DefillamaTotal cumulated KyberSwap trading volume on Optimism to be+$540M higher(to reach >= $1.3B) than when grant funds are received.

We can evaluate our performance with the Grants Council periodically e.g. after the first 3 months.If 50% of these milestones have not been reached by 3 months after receipt of half of the requested OP tokens, KyberSwap will submit a revised distribution plan to increase the odds of meeting the total goal.Performance SummaryAfter 6 months, on the completion of all milestones, KyberSwap will submit a summary of results to the Grants Council. This should be completed no later than 6 months after receipt of OP tokens, even if some milestones are incomplete.Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?KyberSwap has devised a strategy for sustainable liquidity mining on Optimism through:1. Active optimization of the liquidity pools and incentivesKyberDAO funds (already approved by KyberDAO earlier) would be used to seed liquidity on concentrated liquidity pools on Optimism. Depending on market conditions, the LP fee tier and price range of the pools can be customized and liquidity reallocated to ensure better rates and volume, which in turn increases organic yield APR% for LPs.OP and KNC incentives can be capped for each farm once the optimal TVL (to achieve best rates) is reached, to ensure more efficient use of incentives.2. New volume-based yield farming mechanismApart from the typical yield farming model based on the time period of an active liquidity position, KyberSwap introduced a new type of farm for tick-based AMMs (that have NFTs representing the liquidity position). This type of farm distributes incentives based on both the time period AND the target trading volume that the liquidity position is supporting. As such, liquidity incentives will be used efficiently for better performing farms that generate higher volume (and fees for LPs).When the OP incentives end, TVL and user adoption are expected to have already hit the required threshold to capture sufficient trading volume and fee APR%, thus retaining existing liquidity providers and attracting new ones.There will still be KNC incentives allocated for other activities on Optimism beyond just liquidity mining. KyberSwap plans to have a close, positive, and long-term collaboration with the Optimism team to bring more users, liquidity, and growth to the ecosystem.Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)KyberSwap smart contracts have been audited by ChainSecurity and KNC and KyberDAO contracts by Hacken.ChainSecurity audit:https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/Hacken audit:https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/04042021_Kyber_SC_Audit_Report.pdfDeveloper Documentation:https://docs.kyberswap.comKyberSwap Elastic smart contracts:GitHub - KyberNetwork/ks-elastic-sc: Main smart contract for Pro-AMMSocial channelsTwitter: 235K followersTelegram: 14K membersDiscord: 7.9K membersForum: 580 membersYoutube: 3.5K subscribersFacebook: 23K followersReddit: 12.7K membersCoinGecko pagesKyberSwap:https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kyberswap-elastic-optimismKNC:https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kyber-network-crystalThank you for considering our proposal.

Our members include some of the most seasoned Security Researchers in the industry. We provide security audits, monitoring, advisory and incident response services for organizations like Optimism, OpenSea, Polygon, and Connext. More about our work with Optimism and other clients can be found on our website / portfolo.Immunefi is a web3 focused bug bounty platform that utilizes a network of 30k+ whitehat hackers for any type of blockchain project that utilizes smart contracts. Projects also have the ability to list bug bounties for more traditional SAAS frameworks such as their web/app architecture. Our client roster includes some of the most industry leading names like Polygon, Lido, RocketPool, SushiSwap, GMX, Arbitrum, etc. Refer to our website for additional information on client roster and previous work.Please explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:Technical decentralization, at its core, involves the distribution of control, authority, and operation across multiple independent entities. This avoids a single point of failure and prevents the system from being controlled by a single entity.Security Assurance for Decentralized Infrastructure: This program will ensure the security of decentralized infrastructure by incentivizing the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities. Given the interconnectedness of protocols in the DeFi ecosystem, vulnerabilities in protocols with large TVL can pose systemic risk, lead to multi-protocol exploits, and cripple the reputation of entire ecosystems. A bug bounty program aimed at the largest protocols can help mitigate such systemic risks, contributing to a more stable and resilient decentralized environment. This program will also allow large protocols building on Optimism to receive a wide variety of opinions and feedback on their protocol and smart contract code since Immunefi utilizes a community of 30K+ whitehat hackers. A wide variety of opinions and feedback will contribute to the security assurance for decentralized infrastructure since it allows projects to receive unbiased and new feedback.Distributed Accountability: Our proposal distributes the responsibility of network security to a broader group, thus decentralizing the accountability that would traditionally lie with a central authority or a small group of developers. It can also support the work of community teams like OP Labs by providing an additional layer of security review and feedback. This can enhance the quality and reliability of their development work, contributing to the overall health of the decentralized ecosystem.Enabling Bridge Decentralization: Secure apps are crucial for bridge decentralization, as they often serve as primary liquidity sources and integration points for cross-chain interactions. Ensuring the security of a major app, therefore, helps facilitate safer and more efficient cross-chain operations, contributing to the overall technical decentralization. Immunefi and Spearbit utilize a massive community of whitehat hackers and vetted Security Researchers with experience across various ecosystems, languages, and types of projects. This program will further contribute to bridge decentralization since it will help secure apps as apps seek cross-chain functionality.We believe that this program would represent a start in the direction of a community-led security effort, one where new protocols and users would have confidence in deploying their time and money.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Spearbit has an established track record in the field of auditing and security consulting in web3. With our network of Security Researchers, we can ensure high quality code reviews leveraging our community to maximize detection and prevention. Our previous work with the Optimism Foundation further attests to our capabilities in this area.Immunefi is a web3 focused bug bounty platform that protects over $60 billion in user funds. We work with many notable names across L1s, L2s, defi protocols such as LayerZero, Cronos Labs, Polygon, Arbitrum, Boba Network, GMX, SushiSwap, etc. in hosting bug bounties for their protocols. We host bug bounties for any type of blockchain project, regardless of coding language, ecosystem, or type or project (defi vs. creator economy). We utilize a community of over 30k whitehat hackers who use our platform to hunt for bugs within our clients‚Äô protocols. Immunefi is well-suited in executing this mission given the wide variety of projects, languages, and ecosystems that we currently work with. Our whitehat hacker community does not discriminate against any type of project, allowing Optimism projects to receive a diverse set of opinions and feedback from various types of whitehat hackers all around the world.Please list a critical milestone: Achievement of comprehensive bug coverage in large protocols on Optimism.

For people to remain engaged long-term, we need to talk to them in their native language and with concepts they can understand. We want to help Optimism achieve that for Spanish because only 12% of people in LATAM speak English; this means there are more than 418 million people in LATAM that need crypto and could get a better education and exposure to the Optimistic Vision in the language they can understand. This is an enormous amount of people. To make things achievable, we‚Äôll invest the grant to expand awareness in the solid Espacio Cripto community we have today. Our dedication to educating and empowering the Spanish-speaking community aligns perfectly with the mission of the Optimism Collective.Espacio Cripto will execute a series of impactful activities under the clusters of awareness, engagement, and loyalty by introducing a comprehensive strategy to promote the Optimistic Vision. These activities aim to significantly increase awareness, understanding, and long-term commitment to the Optimistic Vision within the Web3 community in Mexico and LATAM, attracting value-aligned users, builders, and partners passionate about the vision of public goods and regenerative finance. Our proposal is the following:Awareness: Promote the Optimistic Vision through strategic initiatives that reach our vast audience. Activities:Incorporating Optimism-related announcements in all our weekly news recap episodes, Navegando.Placing dedicated banners in every edition of our weekly news recap newsletter, reaching a wide subscriber base.Sharing informative and engaging carousel posts on Instagram every 15 days, highlighting the key aspects of Optimism.Posting a tweet thread every 15 days, providing valuable insights and updates about Optimism to our active Twitter community.Engagement: Foster curiosity and understanding of the Optimistic Vision. Activities:Delivering a monthly newsletter exclusively focused on Optimism, providing in-depth analysis, and highlighting significant developments.Producing an episode dedicated to exploring the Optimistic Vision, discussing its principles, and showcasing its potential impact.Creating an episode dedicated to Retro PGF projects, discussing their progress and role in the ecosystem.Organizing a digital meetup with the Optimism team and delegates, enabling interactive Q&A sessions and fostering direct engagement with the community.We‚Äôre starting a new research arm in Espacio Cripto, we‚Äôll publish a detailed report about Optimism, the vision, roadmap, how the technology works, and any other relevant topic. This will be at least a month of work from our analyst team.Loyalty: Build a solid and dedicated community of Optimism supporters and incentivize contributors to the Optimistic Vision. Activities:Organizing a dedicated IRL meetup in Mexico City focused solely on Optimism, providing a platform for community members to connect, learn, and share ideas.Identifying and nurturing local talent to establish a dedicated Optimism delegate in Mexico, further strengthening the connection between the community and Optimism‚Äôs goals.What makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?Espacio Cripto was started by me Abraham Cobos and Lalo Rios. Lalo and I met at a crypto conference in 2018; we started being friends on that day and kept in touch for the upcoming years. In August 2020, Lalo and I reconnected and started ideating around starting a new podcast; that‚Äôs when we began Espacio Cripto‚Äôs community. This project was born to create high-value crypto content in Spanish; we want to help people understand crypto most impartially and positively. We never speculate on prices and always try to keep a realistic view of this fantastic industry. We believe in the Espacio Cripto Education Triad: high-quality content, decentralization, and simplicity. Espacio Cripto is a community that brings people together to learn about crypto and web3 inclusively. Today we‚Äôre more than a podcast; we‚Äôre a healthy community of builders focused on spreading the culture of decentralization and onboarding as many people as possible to web3.Here are some of our achievements as a community:Our North Star: Espacio Cripto‚Äôs community grew significantly during the last months.
